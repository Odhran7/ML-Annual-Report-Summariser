narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

• focus on stable feebased energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure and energy transition of growing markets within north america or served by us exports 

• increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs operating safely and employing environmentally sound operating practices 

• exercise discipline in capital allocation and in evaluating expansion projects and acquisition opportunities 

• leverage economies of scale from acquisitions and asset expansions that fit within our strategy and 

• maintain a strong financial profile and enhance and return value to our stockholders 

it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances however as discussed under item 1a “risk factors” below and at the beginning of this report in “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 

we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures and we are currently contemplating potential transactions any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions and as applicable receipt of fairness opinions and approval of our board of directors while there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations

f asset also has storage capacity of 60 mbbl 

segment competition 

the market for natural gas infrastructure is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve demand for natural gas in the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment we compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing storage and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service flexibility availability of alternative forms of energy and reliability of service from time to time projects are proposed that compete with our existing assets whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability is typically not known 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including oil coal nuclear and renewables such as hydro wind and solar power along with other evolving forms of renewable energy several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of supply other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

industry regulation 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

we operate our interstate natural gas pipeline and storage facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and the provisions of the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the energy policy act of 2005 the energy policy act these laws provide the ferc authority over the construction and operation of such facilities including their modification extension enlargement and abandonment the ferc also has authority over the rates charged and terms and conditions of services offered by interstate natural gas pipeline and storage companies the ferc’s regulatory authority extends to establishing minimum and maximum rates for services and allows operators to discount or negotiate rates on a nondiscriminatory basis the rates terms and conditions of service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the ferc for each of our interstate natural gas pipeline and storage companies posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without ferc authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement the ferc can initiate proceedings on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreedupon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates negotiated rate agreements must be filed with ferc or included in the pipeline’s tariff in summary form 

ferc regulations also include a comprehensive framework for market transparency and nondiscrimination as well as the ferc’s prohibition against market manipulation under the energy policy act and related regulations it is unlawful for any entity directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc to engage in fraudulent conduct ferc standards of conduct regulate among other things the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates ferc’s market oversight and transparency regulations require annual reports of purchases or sales of natural gas meeting certain thresholds and criteria and certain public postings of information on scheduled volumes 

ferc has authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and regulations of more than 13 million per day per violation should we fail to comply with all applicable statutes rules regulations and orders administered by ferc we could be subject to substantial civil penalties and fines 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we 

maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common liquids carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common liquids carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint accordingly certain of the sfpp pipelines’ rates have been subject to challenge with the ferc as is more fully described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a petroleum products or crude oil pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our west coast refined products operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the west coast refined products operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission of mexico the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 subject to an additional renewal term 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitation i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  national agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations issued by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments 

located in what are referred to as high consequence areas hcas and moderate consequence areas mcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

in october 2019 phmsa published a final rule effective july 1 2020 to i expand integrity management program requirements outside of hcas with some exceptions and ii reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure maop on certain pipelines in populated areas including hcas the maop reconfirmations must be completed by 2035 changes in technology such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to phmsa regulations or interpretations can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity assessments testing and repairs we plan to continue to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations we expect the costs to comply with phmsa regulations including integrity management program requirements will be substantial such costs will vary depending on the number of repairs or upgrades determined to be necessary as a result of integrity testing assessments performed as part of our program could identify results that require significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures to address we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with phmsa regulations 

regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines or facilities may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health  including infectious diseases such as covid19 and safety in general we believe we are fulfilling the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new or revised regulatory developments we may be required to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however there are no known new or revised regulations which will require a material increase in our expenditures 

state and local regulation 

certain of our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may result in claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution thirdparty claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in the us congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreignflagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of 

vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the us secretary of transportation upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

canadian regulation 

the utopia pipeline system owned by a joint venture that we operate and in which we own a 50 interest originates in ohio and terminates in windsor ontario canada and is therefore subject to us regulation as described in this section and below under the heading “ —environmental matters ” as well as similar regulations promulgated by canadian authorities with respect to natural gas liquids pipelines 

derivatives regulation 

we use energy commodity derivative contracts as part of our strategy to hedge our exposure to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments such as futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps the doddfrank act requires the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market in october 2020 the cftc finalized one of the last remaining new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that institutes broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as finalized these rules include exemptions for hedging positions and while we cannot yet predict the full impact of the rules when they take effect in 2022 and 2023 we do not expect that the rules will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict how new leadership at the cftc as a result of the change in the us presidential administration may impact us 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analyses under federal and state laws including the clean water act the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act as well as executive orders focused on environmental justice considerations the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal and state environmental laws for both new and existing facilities could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities in general the cost of environmental control at facilities is increasing and limiting the return on capital projects and the number of capital projects that are viable 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the longterm trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate several state and federal agencies have also increased their daily and maximum penalty amounts in recent years revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers as well as increased penalty amounts for inadvertent noncompliance such as an unexpected pipeline leak could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we record liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or 

previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or a similar state agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could affect our actual joint and several liability exposures for response costs as well as natural resource damages 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 243 million as of december 31 2021 for additional information related to environmental matters see note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes from time to time the epa as well as other us federal and state regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations or wastes from oil and gas facilities that are currently exempt as exploration and production waste may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance” by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of fills and pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of fills and pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal or state authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act the epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 the epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 parts per billion ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggered a process under which the epa designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the 2015 standards in december 2020 epa completed a review of the ozone naaqs and published a rule retaining the 

2015 standards state rules implementing the naaqs including those existing or proposed in colorado and new mexico require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newlyinstalled equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls these rules will have financial impacts to our natural gas business unit future state rules could have financial impacts on multiple business units 

climate change 

due to concern over climate change numerous proposals to monitor and limit emissions of ghgs have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the federal state and local levels of government methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of ghgs various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such ghgs including the epa programs to report ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs climaterelated laws and regulation could lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

beginning in 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain ghgs including co 2 and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with requirements for reducing reporting and permitting ghg emissions in november 2021 epa published preamble language for a proposed new rule to regulate ghgs from new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector the proposal would require states to limit methane emissions consistent with the epa proposed “emission guidelines” which are meant be presumptive standards for the states to follow these standards include increased monitoring requirements and require installation of pollution control equipment on a wide variety of equipment including compressor engines pneumatic controllers and tanks the epa proposal did not include draft rule language so the total cost to comply with the proposed rule is difficult to predict however if the rule is finalized in a similar format to what is proposed we expect significant increases in capital and operating expenditures to comply with this epa regulation 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs such as through establishment of ghg reduction targets or regional ghg “cap and trade” programs it is possible that sources such as our gasfueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to these state ghg reduction regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented stricter regulations for reporting monitoring or reduction of ghgs that go beyond the requirements of the epa compliance with state rules could require additional expenditures above and beyond those spent to comply with the november 2021 proposed epa ghg rules for new and existing sources 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of ghgs primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment or emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the ghg emissions pay taxes related to the ghg emissions and administer and manage a more comprehensive ghg emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated companies in our industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions however the timing severity and location of these climate change impacts are not known with certainty and these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over varying time horizons 

because the combustion of natural gas produces lower ghg emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives to reduce ghgs could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that ghg regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery 

operations within our co 2 business segment however these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts ghg regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined riskbased performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

in response to ongoing cybersecurity threats affecting the pipeline industry the dhs’s transportation safety administration issued two new security directives in 2021 which require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures designate a cybersecurity coordinator provide vulnerability assessments and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements compliance with these directives is consuming significant resources and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures to comply with regulations andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

human capital 

in managing our human capital resources we use a strategic approach to building a diverse inclusive and respectful workplace our human resources department provides expertise and tools to attract develop and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals our leadership teams have plans in place to enhance diversity and equality of opportunity in hiring development and promotions we value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals challenges and employee concerns

properties and rightsofway 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land generally under agreements that are perpetual or provide for renewal rights substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased by the company

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business 

the covid19 pandemic and the efforts to control it resulted in a significant decline in global economic activity and significant disruption of global supply chains in 2020 the resulting downturn in economic activity negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil natural gas ngl refined petroleum products co 2  steel chemicals and other products that we handle in our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear as inflationary pressures have increased in the us and globally and efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by new variants 

as the pandemic and responses to it continue we may experience further disruptions to commodities markets supply chains and the health availability and efficiency of our workforce which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations and limit our ability to execute on our business plan there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding covid19 — including the pace and efficacy of vaccination efforts the duration and severity of possible resurgences or additional variants the duration and extent of any travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries and market reactions to the announcement of any such restrictions and closures — to reasonably predict the potential impact of covid19 on our business and operations covid19 may materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to residual impacts from measures taken to combat the virus further adverse impacts from the pandemic may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks we face 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities including the availability of expansion opportunities depend in part on continued production of natural gas crude oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas crude oil ngl refined petroleum products co 2  steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand for example without additions to crude oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput 

commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire additionally demand for such products can decline due to situations over which we have no control such as the covid19 pandemic and various measures that federal state and local authorities have implemented in response to the virus or its economic consequences 

in addition to economic disruptions resulting from events such as covid19 conditions in the business environment generally such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions or higher development or production costs could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets also sustained lower demand for hydrocarbons or changes in the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products in recent years a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing ghg emissions have been undertaken by federal state and municipal governments and crude oil and gas industry participants in addition public concern about the potential risks posed by climate change has resulted in increased demand for energy efficiency and a transition to energy provided from renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels fuelefficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles and pursuit of other technologies to reduce ghg emissions such as carbon capture and sequestration we may see an intensification of these trends if and to the extent that the biden presidential administration succeeds in enacting its energy and environmental policies 

these factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments furthermore such unfavorable conditions may compound the adverse effects of larger disruptions such as covid19 see “— financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” below 

we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for the products we handle in addition irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us 

we face competition from other pipelines and terminals as well as other forms of transportation and storage 

competition is a factor affecting our existing businesses and our ability to secure new project opportunities any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation such as barge rail or truck that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors likewise competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options or customers opt to construct their own facilities for services previously provided by us this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us if capacity on our assets remains unused our ability to recontract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired in addition to the extent that companies pursuing development of carbon capture and sequestration technology are successful they could compete with us for customers who purchase co 2 for use in enhanced oil recovery operations 

the volatility of crude oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses and the carrying values of certain of their respective assets which include related goodwill depend to a large degree on prevailing crude oil ngl and natural gas prices 

prices for crude oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii domestic and global economic conditions iii the activities of the opec and other countries that are significant producers of crude oil opec iv governmental regulation v political instability in crude oil producing countries vi the foreign supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports viii the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities and ix the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks we are also subject indirectly to volatility of commodity prices through many of our customers’ direct exposure to such volatility please read “—our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income ” 

in 2020 the impact of covid19 combined with a dispute regarding production levels among opec countries caused crude oil prices to reach historic lows in april 2020 while global oil demand and prices improved later in 2020 and through 2021 from the low levels experienced in early 2020 the announcement of a newly discovered variant of covid19 in late november 2021 resulted in a sharp unexpected and temporary decline in the price of crude oil if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

sharp declines in the prices of crude oil ngl or natural gas such as we experienced in the first half of 2020 or a prolonged unfavorable price environment may result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell crude oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value which includes assigned goodwill of our co 2 business segment’s proved reserves certain assets in certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines business segment and certain assets within our products pipelines business segment for example following the commodity price declines we experienced during the first half of 2020 we recorded a combined 1950 billion of noncash impairments associated with our natural gas pipelines nonregulated and co 2 reporting units primarily for impairments of goodwill and assets owned in these businesses see note 4 “losses and gains on impairments divestitures and other writedowns” and note 8 “ goodwill ” to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

in recent decades there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle such as leaks releases the breakdown underperformance or failure of equipment facilities information systems or processes damage to our pipelines caused by thirdparty construction the compromise of information and control systems spills at terminals and hubs spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities adverse sea conditions including storms and rising sea levels and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals operator error labor disputeswork stoppages disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers operational disruptions or apportionment on thirdparty systems or refineries on which our assets depend and catastrophic events or natural disasters such as fires floods explosions earthquakes acts of terrorists and saboteurs cyber security breaches and other similar events many of which are beyond our control additional risks to our vessels include capsizing grounding and navigation errors 

the occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution significant reputational damage impairment or suspension of operations fines or other regulatory penalties and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements any of which also could result in substantial financial losses including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater in addition the consequences of any operational incident including as a result of adverse sea conditions at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines andor the repair of marine terminals 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

unfavorable conditions such as a general slowdown of the global or us economy uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets or inflation and rising interest rates could materially adversely affect our operating results for example as described above covid19 resulted in a global economic downturn in 2020 the slowdown resulting from the pandemic affected numerous industries including the crude oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services while global economic activity largely rebounded in 2021 we could experience similar or compounded adverse impacts as a result of other global events affecting economic conditions also economic conditions in the wake of the pandemic have included inflationary pressure which could result in higher operating expenses and project costs for us as well as higher interest rates 

in addition uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions sustained unfavorable commodity prices volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us see “—financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas are likely to have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “—the volatility of crude oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments” 

if economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets globally in the us or in other key markets become more volatile or deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing and some of them may be highly leveraged and may not be able to access additional capital to sustain their operations in the future our counterparties are subject to their own operating market financial and regulatory risks and some have experienced are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness for example in 2020 the global economic slowdown caused by covid19 and the coinciding extreme drop in crude oil prices which was exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic significantly impacted the financial condition of many companies particularly exploration and production companies including some of our customers or counterparties further the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited including by ferc regulation while certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and therefore the parent’s credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers’ ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us see note 2 “ summary of significant accounting policies—allowance for credit losses ” in our consolidated financial statements 

furthermore financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts owed to us similarly our contracts with such customers may be renegotiated at lower rates or terminated altogether significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion 

our business operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects in addition market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders 

reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk credit market operational insurance regulatory and legal risks among others must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry particularly other energy infrastructure providers over which we have no control in particular our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase ghg emissions and contribute to climate change negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion including with respect to the production transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally could include increased regulatory oversight delays in obtaining or challenges to regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects blockades project cancellations difficulty securing financing revenue loss reduction in customer base and decreased value of our securities and our business 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2 business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our direct exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas and ngl including differentials between regional markets these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl furthermore our hedging arrangements cannot hedge against any decrease in the volumes of products we handle see “ —our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle” 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent thenexisting underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions limiting our ability to hedge our exposure to unfavorable commodity prices 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those consolidated financial statements in addition it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices therefore our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates—hedging activities ” and note 14 “ risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology it or operational ot systems or those of third parties may adversely affect our business results of operations or business reputation 

our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions some of the operational systems we use are owned or operated by independent thirdparty vendors the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems collecting and storing information and data processing transactions and handling other processing necessary to manage our business 

while we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our it ot and data systems from attacks we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program will be effective as a result of the covid19 pandemic and our subsequent continuation of hybrid officeandremoteworking arrangements with some of our employees remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially while we have taken additional steps to secure our networks and systems we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident when significant numbers of our employees are working remotely we have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization the risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems 

or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations through an act of terrorism or cyber sabotage event has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations a significant failure compromise breach or interruption in our systems which may result from problems such as ransomware malware computer viruses hacking attempts or thirdparty error or malfeasance could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues efforts by us and our vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures including malware and antivirus software and controls may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and any network and information systemsrelated events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event in the future we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures to comply with regulations andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

attacks including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage or the threat of such attacks may adversely affect our business or reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events for example in may 2021 a ransomware attack on a major us refined products pipeline forced the operator to temporarily shut down the pipeline resulting in disruption of fuel supplies along the east coast potential targets include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems the occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters as well as subsidence and coastal erosion and climaterelated physical risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion these natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of weather and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding these climaterelated changes could result in damage to physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions in addition we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” 

our insurance policies do not cover all losses costs or liabilities that we may experience and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums 

our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost there is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on 

acceptable terms if at all or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of nonrenewal the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining or our inability to obtain permits and rightsofway as well as public opposition increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns inclement weather and other delays should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others we will share control of and any benefits from those projects 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets new growth projects generally will be subject to among other things the receipt of regulatory approvals feasibility and cost analyses funding availability and industry market and demand conditions if we pursue joint ventures with third parties those parties may share approval rights over major decisions and may act in their own interests their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses which in turn could affect the financial expectations of and our expected benefits from the venture a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals have caused and may continue to cause delays in or cancellations of our construction projects regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects such as the ferc’s consideration of changes to its certificate policy statement such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects see “— we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion ” for example changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rightsofway or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction in addition inflationary pressure that emerged during the economic recovery following the covid19 pandemic is likely to increase our costs for construction materials significant increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns or delays or our inability to obtain a required permit or rightofway could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the us have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightsofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets we evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate 

if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i the loss of key customers of the acquired business ii demands on management related to the increase in our size iii the diversion of management’s attention from the 

management of daily operations iv difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting budgeting reporting internal controls and other systems and v difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders steve kean our chief executive officer and kim dang our president along with the other members of our senior management messrs kinder and kean and ms dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean ms dang or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 324 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ evolving policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossilfuel energy companies which has resulted in certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in such companies ultimately this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of january 4 2022 approximately 21 billion of our approximately 324 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements covering an additional 51 billion of our consolidated debt will expire at the end of 2022 should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service variablerate debt would increase as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures if our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to regulation 

the ferc or state public utility commissions such as the cpuc may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc state public utility commissions or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc or state public utility commissions to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact on our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these authorities have the potential to adversely affect our profitability additional regulatory burdens and uncertainties will be created if and to the extent that more stringent energy and environmental policies are enacted for example on november 15 2021 the epa published a proposed rule containing standards of performance for ghg emissions in the form of methane limitations and volatile organic compound emissions for new modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas sources including the production processing transmission and storage segments this proposal if finalized and other regulatory initiatives may affect our assets and operations directly or indirectly such as by increasing the costs associated with the production of natural gas and liquids that we transport in addition on january 27 2021 the president issued an executive order directing among other matters the reevaluation of the leasing program for federally managed lands and the “pause” of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of the review in july 2021 a federal district court granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against enforcement of the “pause” the biden administration has appealed the injunction on november 26 2021 the department of the interior issued a report in response to the president’s executive order calling for an increase in royalty payments for new oil and gas leases on federal lands these and other initiatives of the presidential administration may affect our assets and operations directly or indirectly such as by preventing or delaying the exploration for and production of natural gas and liquids that we transport 

regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state and local taxation ii rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vii the acquisition of other businesses viii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities ix reporting and information posting requirements x the maintenance of accounts and records and xi relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws or regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—industry regulation ” 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations 

affect many aspects of our past present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act the oil pollution act or analogous state laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could harm our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if a leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows 

we own andor operate numerous properties and equipment that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties and equipment owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us for example the federal clean air act and other similar federal and state laws are subject to periodic review and amendment which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity at the federal and state levels there are for example regulations issued by the us department of transportation us dot for pipeline companies in the areas of operations testing education training and communication we expect the costs of compliance with these regulations including integrity management rules will be substantial the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in hcas or mcas can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the us dot rules repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to address results of these tests andor ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipeline could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating 

restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climaterelated risk and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of ghgs such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report ghg emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2 for example from our mcelmo dome co 2 field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further address ghg emissions include establishing ghg “cap and trade” programs a fee on methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems increased efficiency standards participation in international climate agreements issuance of executive orders by the us presidential administration and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our ghg emissions pay taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could result in damage to our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including activity on public lands and hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas including lands that are federally managed policy and regulatory initiatives or legislation by congress may decrease access to federally managed lands and increase the regulatory burdens associated with using these lands to produce crude oil or natural gas 

the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent in areas where we have operations oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of certain hydraulic fracturing activities adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements related not only to well development but also to compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location 

emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and crewed by predominately us citizens our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens 

proposed changes to us federal state and local tax laws if enacted could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 

new or revised us federal state or local tax legislation may be enacted in the future and such legislation could materially impact our current or future tax planning and effective tax rates for example president biden and congress have set forth proposals that would if enacted make significant changes to us federal income tax laws applicable to domestic corporations such proposals include but are not limited to i an increase in the us federal income tax rate applicable to corporations and ii a minimum book income tax applicable to certain large corporations it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could take effect the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in us federal income or other tax laws could materially and adversely affect our business cash flows and future profitability 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock these reflect our current judgment but as with any estimate they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report if our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions ” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the 

percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders

general 

business segments 

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future we have four business segments as further described below 

natural gas pipelines 

this segment owns and operates i major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems ii natural gas gathering systems and processing and treating facilities iii ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems and iv lng regasification liquefaction and storage facilities 

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under longterm fixed contracts to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 84 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2021 the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts held by assets we own and have equity interests in including intrastate pipelines’ sales portfolio was approximately six years our lng regasification and liquefaction and associated storage contracts are subscribed under longterm agreements with a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 12 years 

our midstream assets provide natural gas gathering and processing services these assets are mostly feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into its base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to feebased arrangements some of which may include minimum volume commitments we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percent 

ofindex and keepwhole contracts our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

products pipelines 

this segment owns and operates refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver among other products gasoline diesel and jet fuel crude oil and condensate to various markets this segment also owns andor operates associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have 49 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biodiesel the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines and terminals located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index and a ferc index rate 

our crude condensate and refined petroleum products transportation services are primarily provided pursuant to i either ferc or state tariffs and ii longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however the revenues and earnings we realize from our pipelines and terminals are affected by the volumes of crude oil refined petroleum products and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity and product demand in the respective regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

terminals 

this segment owns and operates i liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the us that store and handle various commodities including gasoline diesel fuel chemicals renewable fuels metals and petroleum coke and ii jones actqualified tankers 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipelines business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the remaining length of the underlying service contracts which on a weighted average basis is approximately three years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 

as with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are petroleum coke metals and ores in addition the majority of our contracts for this business contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated events including hurricanes may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones actqualified tankers in our terminals business segment as of december 31 2021 we have 16 jones actqualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are primarily operating pursuant to fixed price term charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

co 2 

this segment i manages the production transportation and marketing of co 2 to oil fields that use co 2 as a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields ii owns interests in andor operates oil fields and gasoline processing plants in west texas iii owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system in west texas and iv owns and operates rng and lng facilities in indiana associated with our acquisition of kinetrex discussed below 

the co 2 source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2021 had a remaining average contract life of approximately eight years co 2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our current sales contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price beginning in 2022 due to the floor price associated with a significant sales contract no longer being a component of the pricing formula only a small percentage of our sales contracts will be based on a fixed fee or floor price our success in this portion of the co 2 business segment can be impacted by the demand for co 2  in the co 2 business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add the revenues we receive from our crude oil and ngl sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 5271 per barrel in 2021 and 5378 per barrel in 2020 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 6847 per barrel in 2021 and 3832 per barrel in 2020 

also see note 15 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about the types of contracts and revenues recognized for each of our segments 

stagecoach acquisition 

on july 9 2021 and november 24 2021 we completed the acquisitions of stagecoach gas services llc and its subsidiaries stagecoach a natural gas pipeline and storage joint venture between consolidated edison inc and crestwood equity partners lp for approximately 1258 million including purchase price adjustments for working capital the stagecoach assets include 4 natural gas storage facilities with a total ferccertificated working capacity of 41 bcf and a network of fercregulated natural gas transportation pipelines with multiple interconnects to major interstate natural gas pipelines in the northeast region of the us including tgp the acquired assets are included in our natural gas pipelines business segment 

kinetrex acquisition 

on august 20 2021 we completed the acquisition of indianapolisbased kinetrex from an affiliate of parallel49 equity for 318 million including a preliminary purchase price adjustment for working capital kinetrex is a supplier of lng in the midwest and a producer and supplier of rng under longterm contracts to transportation service providers kinetrex has a 50 interest in the largest rng facility in indiana and we commenced construction on three additional landfillbased rng facilities in september 2021 the acquired assets are included as part of our new energy transition ventures group within our co 2 business segment 

sale of an interest in ngpl holdings llc 

on march 8 2021 we and brookfield infrastructure partners lp brookfield completed the sale of a combined 25 interest in our joint venture ngpl holdings llc ngpl holdings to a fund controlled by arclight capital partners llc arclight we received net proceeds of 412 million for our proportionate share of the interests sold we recognized a pretax gain of 206 million for our proportionate share which is included within “other net” in our accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 we and brookfield now each hold a 375 interest in ngpl holdings

we expect to declare dividends of 111 per share for 2022 a 3 increase from the 2021 declared dividends of 108 per share we also expect to invest 13 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures or discretionary capital expenditures during 2022 

the expectations for 2022 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “ risk factors ” below and “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to these 2022 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

critical accounting estimates 

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions involve material levels of subjectivity and complex judgement to account for highly uncertain matters or matters with a high susceptibility to change and could result in a material impact to our financial statements examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others when preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition ii income taxes iii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iv the fair values used in a assigning the purchase price of a business acquisition b calculations of possible asset and equity investment impairment charges c calculation for the annual goodwill impairment test or interim tests if triggered and d recording derivative contract assets and liabilities v reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities vi provisions for credit losses vii computation of the gain or loss if any on assets sold in whole or in part and viii exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements and the following discussion for further information regarding critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 

acquisition method of accounting 

for acquired businesses we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition with any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded to goodwill determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment andor the utilization of independent valuation specialists and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements 

impairments 

in addition to our annual testing of impairment for goodwill we evaluate impairment of our longlived assets when a triggering event occurs management applies judgment in determining whether there is an impairment indicator fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our longlived assets including intangible assets goodwill and equity method investments for impairment involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the estimates and assumptions can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts an estimate of the sensitivity to changes in underlying assumptions of a fair value calculation is not practicable given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates 

for more information on our impairments and significant estimates and assumptions used in our impairment evaluations see note 4 “losses and gains on impairments divestitures and other writedowns” 

hedging activities 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts our accrual of environmental liabilities often coincides either with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our probable environmental liabilities if necessary or appropriate following quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations in recording and adjusting environmental liabilities we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see part i items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

legal and regulatory matters 

many of our operations are regulated by various us regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2021 our pension plans were underfunded by 427 million and our opeb plans were overfunded by 125 million our pension and opeb obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and opeb plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determining the benefit obligation to the underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits ” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and opeb can be and have been revised in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2021 we had deferred net losses of approximately 319 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and opeb plans 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and opeb plans for the year ended december 31 2021 



a includes amounts deferred as either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations 

income taxes 

we make significant judgments and estimates in determining our provision for income taxes including our assessment of our income tax positions given the uncertainties involved in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions numerous and complex judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income when determining a valuation allowance including factors such as future operating conditions and the apportionment of income by state for more information see note 5 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

overview 

as described in further detail below our management evaluates our performance primarily using the gaap financial measures of segment ebda as presented in note 16 “ reportable segments ” and net income attributable to kinder morgan inc along with the nongaap financial measures of adjusted earnings and dcf both in the aggregate and per share for each adjusted segment ebda adjusted ebitda and net debt 

gaap financial measures 

the consolidated earnings results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 present segment ebda and net income attributable to kinder morgan inc which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as unallocated employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income attributable to kinder morgan inc or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap financial measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

certain items 

certain items as adjustments used to calculate our nongaap financial measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income attributable to kinder morgan inc but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses we also include adjustments related to joint ventures see “amounts from joint ventures” below and the tables included in “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted ebitda” and “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information” below in addition certain items are described in more detail in the footnotes to tables included in “—segment earnings results” and “—dda general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests” below 

adjusted earnings 

adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income attributable to kinder morgan inc adjusted earnings per share uses adjusted earnings and applies the same twoclass method used in arriving at basic earnings per share see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” below 

dcf 

dcf is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for certain items adjusted earnings and further by dda and amortization of excess cost of equity investments income tax expense cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items we also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes dda and sustaining capital expenditures see “amounts from joint ventures” below dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income attributable to kinder morgan inc dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” and “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” below 

adjusted segment ebda 

adjusted segment ebda is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for certain items attributable to the segment adjusted segment ebda is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business we believe adjusted segment ebda is a useful performance metric because it provides management and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted segment ebda is segment ebda see “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” for a reconciliation of segment ebda to adjusted segment ebda by business segment 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items we also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes and dda see “amounts from joint ventures” below adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt as described further below to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income attributable to kinder morgan inc in prior periods net income was considered the comparable gaap measure and has been updated to net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for consistency with our other nongaap performance measures see “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” and “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted ebitda” below  

amounts from joint ventures 

certain items dcf and adjusted ebitda reflect amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures utilizing the same recognition and measurement methods used to record “earnings from equity investments” and “noncontrolling interests” respectively the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda related to our unconsolidated and consolidated joint ventures include the same items dda and income tax expense and for dcf only also cash taxes and sustaining capital expenditures with respect to the joint ventures as those included in the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda for our whollyowned consolidated subsidiaries see “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information” below although these amounts related to our unconsolidated joint ventures are included in the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated joint ventures 

net debt 

net debt is calculated based on amounts as of december 31 2021 by subtracting the following amounts from our debt balance of 33320 million i cash and cash equivalents of 1140 million ii debt fair value adjustments of 902 million and iii the foreign exchange impact on eurodenominated bonds of 64 million for which we have entered into currency swaps net debt is a nongaap financial measure that management believes is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage we believe the most comparable measure to net debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents 

consolidated earnings results gaap 

the following tables summarize the key components of our consolidated earnings results 



a includes revenues earnings from equity investments and other net less operating expenses loss on impairments and divestitures net and other income net operating expenses include costs of sales operations and maintenance expenses and taxes other than income taxes 

year ended december 31 2021 vs 2020 

net income attributable to kinder morgan inc increased 1665 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase primarily resulted from i 1092 million of earnings related to the february 2021 winter storm and therefore largely nonrecurring mostly impacting the higher earnings from our natural gas pipelines and co 2 business segments and ii a decrease of 342 million in impairments in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily reflecting the 1600 million pretax noncash asset impairment loss related to south texas gathering and processing assets within our natural gas pipeline segment in 2021 compared to the combined 1950 million of noncash impairments recognized in 2020 of goodwill associated with our natural gas pipelines nonregulated and co 2 reporting units and noncash asset impairments of certain oil and gas producing assets in our co 2 business segment the impacts of the longlived asset impairments were partially offset by associated tax benefits the increase was also impacted by higher earnings from our products pipelines business segment lower interest expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments partially offset by lower earnings from our terminals business segment

year ended december 31 2021 versus year ended december 31 2020 



the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving adjusted segment ebda in the comparable years of 2021 and 2020 

• 1046 million 93 increase in midstream was primarily due to i higher commodity prices driving higher sales margins resulting in increases of 882 million on our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations and 90 million on our south texas assets primarily as a result of the february 2021 winter storm  ii 62 million of higher equity earnings due to php being placed in service in january 2021 iii higher earnings on kinder morgan altamont llc primarily due to higher commodity prices and volumes and iv higher volumes on our hiland midstream assets partially offset by the impacts of lower volumes on kinderhawk and certain purchase contract obligations on our oklahoma assets overall midstream’s revenues increased primarily due to higher commodity prices which was partially offset by corresponding increases in costs of sales 

• 24 million 1 increase in the east region was primarily due to i a 61 million increase resulting from our july 2021 acquisition of the stagecoach assets ii higher earnings from tgp primarily due to weatherdriven increases in reservation and park and loan revenues and iii increased earnings from elc resulting from the liquefaction units of the elba liquefaction project being fully operational as of august 2020 partially offset by lower earnings on fep driven by lower revenues resulting from contract expirations and

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving adjusted segment ebda in the comparable years of 2021 and 2020 

• 59 million 13 increase in west coast refined products was primarily due to increased revenues on pacific operations sfpp and to a lesser extent on calnev and west coast terminals driven by the continued recovery of volumes in 2021 compared to 2020 which was impacted by covid19 partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily as a result of higher integrity management spending 

• 38 million 17 increase in southeast refined products was primarily due to higher 2021 earnings at our transmix processing operations primarily due to higher prices and first quarter 2020 unfavorable inventory adjustments and increased revenues from our south east terminals resulting from higher volumes driven by continued recovery of volumes from 2020 and 

• 7 million 2 decrease in crude and condensate was primarily due to decreased earnings from the bakken crude assets and km condensate processing facility splitter partially offset by increased earnings from kinder morgan crude  condensate pipeline kmcc the bakken crude assets’ decreased earnings was driven by lower volumes contracts renewed at lower average rates and contract expirations partially offset by lower field operating expenses splitter’s decreased earnings was primarily driven by higher field maintenance expenses kmcc’s increased earnings was primarily due to higher deficiency revenues and lower field operating expenses partially offset by contract expirations bakken crude assets’ and kmcc’s changes were also impacted by first quarter 2020 unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments in addition increased marketing activities within kmcc have resulted in increases in revenues with corresponding increases in cost of sales

the changes in segment ebda for our co 2 business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving adjusted segment ebda in the comparable years of 2021 and 2020 

• 67 million 15 increase in oil and gas producing activities was primarily due to lower operating expenses of 143 million driven by a benefit in the 2021 period realized from returning power to the grid by curtailing oil production during the february 2021 winter storm and higher realized ngl prices which increased revenues by 42 million partially offset by decreased revenues of i 50 million resulting from lower crude oil volumes driven in part by the curtailed oil production and ii 27 million related to lower realized crude oil prices and increased operating expenses due to the impact of a settlement of 38 million for a terminated affiliate purchase contract with source and transportation activities and 

• 27 million 13 increase in source and transportation activities primarily due to a settlement of 38 million for a terminated affiliate sales contract with oil and gas producing activities which resulted in an increase in revenues partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 17 million related to lower co 2 sales volumes 

we believe that our existing hedge contracts in place within our co 2 business segment substantially mitigate commodity price sensitivities in the nearterm and to lesser extent over the following few years from price exposure below is a summary of our co 2 business segment hedges outstanding as of december 31 2021 



a includes west texas intermediate hedges 

dda general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests 



certain items 

a 2020 amount includes 52 million for restricted stock accelerated vesting and severance expense an increase in expense of 23 million associated with a noncash fair value adjustment and the dividend on the pembina common stock and 15 million related to costs incurred associated with covid19 mitigation 

b amounts are adjusted for certain items 

c 2021 and 2020 amounts include decreases in interest expense of 19 million and 21 million respectively related to noncash debt fair value adjustments associated with acquisitions and a decrease of 15 million and an increase of 8 million in interest expense respectively related to noncash mismatches between the change in fair value of interest rate swaps and change in fair value of hedged debt 

general and administrative expenses and corporate charges adjusted for certain items increased 62 million in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to lower capitalized costs of 48 million reflecting reduced capital spending primarily by our natural gas pipelines business segment higher benefitrelated costs of 34 million and nonrecurring cost savings realized in the 2020 period as a result of the global pandemic of 33 million partially offset by 41 million of cost savings in the 2021 period associated with organizational efficiency efforts and lower pension costs of 17 million 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net adjusted for certain items decreased 92 million in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to lower longterm debt balances lower libor rates and lower longterm interest rates partially offset by lower capitalized interest 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 and 2020 approximately 21 and 16 respectively of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps the percentage at december 31 2021 excludes 4860 million of variabletofixed interest rate derivative contracts which became effective january 4 2022 and hedge our exposure through 2022 for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “ risk management—interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us 

income taxes 

year ended december 31 2021 versus year ended december 31 2020 

our income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2021 is approximately 369 million as compared with income tax expense of 481 million for the same period of 2020 the 112 million decrease in income tax expense is due primarily to i the lack of tax benefit on the impairment of nontaxdeductible goodwill in 2020 ii higher dividendreceived deductions in 2021 iii the 2021 enhanced oil recovery credit and iv the release in 2021 of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl these decreases are partially offset by i higher pretax book income in 2021 as a result of the february 2021 winter storm the 2020 impairment of certain co 2 assets and the 2020 demand destruction from the covid19 pandemic and ii the refund of alternative minimum tax sequestration credits in 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

as of december 31 2021 we had 1140 million of “cash and cash equivalents” a decrease of 44 million from december 31 2020 additionally as of december 31 2021 we had borrowing capacity of approximately 39 billion under our credit facilities discussed below in “ —shortterm liquidity ” as discussed further below we believe our cash flows from operating activities cash position and remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facilities are more than adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 5708 million and 4550 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “ —cash flows—operating activities ” we primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures dividend payments and our growth capital expenditures however we may access the debt capital markets from time to time to refinance our maturing longterm debt 

our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 027 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 consistent with previous quarters in 2021 the total of the dividends declared for 2021 of 108 represents a 3 increase over total dividends 

declared for 2020 we expect to fully fund our dividend payments as well as our discretionary spending for 2022 without funding from the capital markets with additional flexibility to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis 

on august 20 2021 we entered into a new 35 billion revolving credit facility the “new credit facility” due august 2026 and amended our existing facility the “existing facility” to reduce the borrowing capacity to 500 million and terminate the letter of credit commitments and the swing line capacity thereunder together the “credit facilities” 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2021 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i cash from operations ii our combined 40 billion of credit facilities and associated commercial paper program and iii cash and cash equivalents the loan commitments under our revolving credit facilities can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facilities and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our new credit facility we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2021 our 2646 million of shortterm debt consisted primarily of senior notes that mature in the next twelve months we intend to fund our debt as it becomes due primarily through cash on hand credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings cash flows from operations andor issuing new longterm debt our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2020 was 2558 million 

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 1992 million and 1871 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively from time to time our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 121 million unfavorable change from yearend 2020 was primarily due to i a 104 million increase in accounts payable net of change in accounts receivable ii an increase of approximately 88 million in senior notes that mature in the next twelve months and iii a net unfavorable shortterm fair value adjustment of 80 million on derivative contract assets and liabilities in 2021 offset partially by a 214 million increase in inventories primarily storage gas and product inventories and a decrease of 23 million in accrued contingencies generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “ —longterm financing ” and “ —capital expenditures ” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings generally we anticipate refinancing maturing longterm debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings a decrease in our credit ratings could negatively impact our borrowing costs and could limit our access to capital 

as of december 31 2021 our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a2 prime2 and f2 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2021 



longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock with a par value of 001 per share we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our discretionary capital investments for the foreseeable future see also “— dividends and stock buyback program ” below for additional discussion related to our dividends and stock buyback program 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries issue longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee each other’s debt see “ —summarized combined financial information for guarantee of securities of subsidiaries  as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 29772 million and 30838 million respectively 

on february 11 2021 we issued in a registered offering 750 million aggregate principal amount of 360 senior notes due 2051 and received net proceeds of 741 million 

on october 26 2021 we issued in a registered offering two series of senior notes consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 175 senior notes due 2026 and 300 million aggregate principal amount of 360 senior notes due 2051 as a reopening of the 360 series discussed above and received combined net proceeds of 796 million 

on january 18 2022 we repaid 260 million of maturing 8625 notes 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping a portion of the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

for additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debtrelated transactions in 2021 see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

counterparty creditworthiness 

some of our customers or other counterparties may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness these financial problems may arise from our current global economic conditions continued volatility of commodity prices or otherwise in such situations we utilize to the extent allowable under applicable contracts tariffs and regulations prepayments and other security requirements such as letters of credit to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these counterparties while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect against counterparty credit risk we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our customers or other counterparties will not become financially distressed and will not default on their obligations to us the balance of our allowance for credit losses as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was  1 million and  26 million respectively reflected in “other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets which includes reserves for counterparty bankruptcies recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 

capital expenditures 

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as 

discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “ —results of operations—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf ” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2021 and the amount we expect to spend for 2022 to sustain our assets and grow our business are as follows 



a 2021 and expected 2022 amounts include 107 million and 120 million respectively for sustaining capital expenditures from unconsolidated joint ventures reduced by consolidated joint venture partners’ sustaining capital expenditures see table included in “ nongaap financial measures—supplemental information ” 

b 2021 combined sustaining and discretionary amounts include 78 million due to increases in accrued capital expenditures and contractor retainage and net changes in other 

c 2021 amount includes 138 million of our contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures for capital investments and 1538 million for our acquisitions of stagecoach and kinetrex 

d amounts include our actual or estimated contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures net of actual or estimated contributions from certain partners in nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries for capital investments

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 1158 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

• a 1264 million increase in cash largely related to the february 2021 winter storm this change in cash is after adjusting the 1670 million increase in net income by 406 million for the combined effects of the periodtoperiod net changes in noncash items including the following i losses from impairments and divestitures net see discussion above in “ —results of operations ” ii gain from the sale of a partial interest in our equity investment in ngpl holdings see discussion above in “ —general ” iii dda expenses including amortization of excess cost of equity investments iv deferred income taxes and v earnings from equity investments including a noncash writedown of a related party note receivable from ruby partially offset by 

• a 106 million decrease in cash associated with net changes in working capital items and other noncurrent assets and liabilities the decrease was driven among other things primarily by payments for litigation matters in the 2021 period compared with the 2020 period 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities increased 1394 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

• a 1531 million increase in expenditures for the acquisition of assets and investments net of cash acquired primarily driven by 1227 million and 311 million of net cash used for the stagecoach and the kinetrex acquisitions respectively in the 2021 period see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these two acquisitions and 

• a 663 million decrease in cash received from the sales of property plant and equipment investments and other net assets net of removal costs primarily due to among other things the 412 million of net proceeds received from the sale of a partial interest in our equity investment in ngpl holdings in the 2021 period versus the 907 million of proceeds received from the sale of pembina shares in the 2020 period see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these two transactions partially offset by 

• a 426 million decrease in capital expenditures reflecting an overall reduction of expansion capital projects in the 2021 period over the comparative 2020 period and 

• a 348 million decrease in cash used for contributions to equity investees driven primarily by lower contributions to php and sng in the 2021 period compared with the 2020 period 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities increased 827 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 

• a 766 million net increase in cash used related to debt activity as a result of higher net debt payments in the 2021 period compared to the 2020 period see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt activity and 

• an 81 million increase in dividend payments to our shareholders 

dividends and stock buyback program 

the table below reflects the declaration of dividends of 108 per share for 2021 



we expect to continue to return additional value to our shareholders in 2022 through our previously announced dividend increase we plan to increase our dividend by 3 to 111 per common share in 2022 based on our 2022 expectations we also expect to have up to 750 million available to invest in attractive opportunities including share repurchases any potential repurchases in 2022 would be under our 2 billion stock buyback program approved by our board of directors in july 2017 since december 2017 in total we have repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our class p common stock under the program at an average price of approximately 1771 per share for approximately 575 million for information on our equity buyback program and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “ risk factors—the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our stock are not paid at the intended levels our stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

energy commodity market risk 

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of crude oil natural gas and ngl the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil natural gas and ngl we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets 

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



we measure the risk of price changes in the derivative instrument portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values because we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying 

physical transactions a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value 



our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil natural gas and ngl portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances including debt fair value adjustments and sensitivity to interest rates 



a fair values were determined using level 2 inputs 

b a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt as of december 31 2021 and 2020 would result in changes of approximately 749 million and 1541 million respectively in the estimated fair values of these instruments 

c december 31 2021 amount excludes 49 billion of variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements that became effective january 4 2022 and expire december 31 2022 december 31 2020 amount includes 25 billion of variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2021 

d december 31 2020 amount includes 900 million of fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2021 

e a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 47 and 49 basis points respectively in 2021 and 2020 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 and 2020 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described in the table above would result in changes of approximately 32 million or 10 million with the inclusion of the variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements described in note c above and 25 million respectively in our 2021 and 2020 annual income before income taxes 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

as presented in the table above we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2021 including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 21 of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates the percentage at december 31 2021 excludes 4860 million of variabletofixed interest rate derivative contracts which became effective january 4 2022 and hedge our exposure through 2022 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

libor phase out 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to us dollar libor usd libor depending on our selection of repayment options and certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to onemonth libor or threemonth libor in july 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced a desire to phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee consisting of large us financial institutions convened by the us federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr an index supported by shortterm treasury repurchase agreements on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration iba the administrator of usd libor announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining usd libor tenors until june 30 2023 providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on libor to mature 

the agreements governing our credit facilities include customary provisions to provide for replacement of libor with an alternative benchmark rate when libor ceases to be available the international swaps and derivatives association has developed provisions for sofrbased fallback rates to apply upon permanent cessation of libor and has published a protocol to enable market participants to include the new provisions in existing swap agreements see also note 19 “recent accounting pronouncements” to our consolidated financial statements for accounting pronouncements related to the libor phase out 

we currently do not expect the transition from libor to have a material impact on us 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2021 we had a notional principal amount of 1358 million of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixedrate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

• focus on stable feebased energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure and energy transition of growing markets within north america or served by us exports 

• increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs operating safely and employing environmentally sound operating practices 

• exercise discipline in capital allocation and in evaluating expansion projects and acquisition opportunities

competition 

the market for natural gas infrastructure is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve demand for natural gas in the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment we compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing storage and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service flexibility availability of alternative forms of energy and reliability of service from time to time projects are proposed that compete with our existing assets whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability is typically not known 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including oil coal nuclear and renewables such as hydro wind and solar power along with other evolving forms of renewable energy several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of supply other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather

industry regulation 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

as an owner and operator of natural gas companies subject to the natural gas act of 1938 we are required to provide service to shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities at regulated rates that have been determined by the ferc to be just and reasonable recourse rates and general terms and conditions for service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the ferc for each pipeline including storage facilities or companies as used herein generally recourse rates are based on our cost of service including recovery of and a return on our investment posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without ferc authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement the ferc can initiate proceedings on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates upon mutual agreement the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates that are not bound by and are irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreedupon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates the actual negotiated rate agreement or a summary of such agreement must be posted as part of the pipelines’ tariffs while pipelines and their shippers may agree to a variety of negotiated rate structures depending on the shipper and circumstance pipelines generally must use for all shippers the form of service agreement that is contained within their fercapproved tariff any deviation from the pro forma service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations in the terms and conditions of service are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980s the ferc adopted a number of regulatory changes to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace examples include ferc regulations requiring interstate natural gas pipelines to separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and provide comparable transportation and 

storage services with respect to all natural gas customers also natural gas pipelines must separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide ie for transportation services and storage services for natural gas to ensure a competitive transportation market these pipelines must adhere to certain scheduling procedures accept capacity segmentation in certain circumstances and abide by fercestablished standards of conduct when communicating with marketing affiliates 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common liquids carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common liquids carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our sfpp operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the sfpp pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a petroleum products or crude oil pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our west coast refined products operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the west coast refined products operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission of mexico the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitation i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  national agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations issued by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas and moderate consequence areas or mcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

during september 2019 phmsa finalized rules to be effective july 1 2020 to expand integrity management program requirements to hazardous liquids pipelines outside of hcas with some exceptions and to make certain other changes to those program requirements including data integration and emphasis on the use of inline inspection technology during october 2019 phmsa finalized rules to require operators of natural gas pipelines to i expand integrity management program requirements outside of hcas with some exceptions and ii reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure maop on certain pipelines in populated areas including hcas the maop reconfirmations must be completed by 2035 changes in technology such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to phmsa regulations can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity assessments testing and repairs we will continue our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations the costs to comply with integrity management program requirements are difficult to predict assessments performed as part of our program could result in significant capital and operating expenditures for upgrades andor repairs deemed necessary to continue the safe and reliable operation of our pipelines we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with these phmsa regulations 

the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or “pipes act of 2016” requires phmsa among other regulators to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to set more stringent standards for intrastate pipelines in compliance with the pipes act of 2016 we have implemented procedures for underground natural gas storage facilities 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the future regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines or facilities may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health  including from infectious diseases such as covid19 and safety in general 

we believe we are fulfilling the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new or revised regulatory developments we may be required to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however there are no known new or revised regulations which will require a material increase in our expenditures 

state and local regulation 

certain of our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may result in claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution thirdparty claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in the us congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreignflagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the us secretary of transportation upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

canadian regulation 

the utopia pipeline system owned by a joint venture that we operate and in which we own a 50 interest originates in ohio and terminates in windsor ontario canada and is therefore subject to us regulation as described in this section and below under the heading “ —environmental matters ” as well as similar regulations promulgated by canadian authorities with respect to natural gas liquids pipelines 

derivatives regulation 

we use energy commodity derivative contracts as part of our strategy to hedge our exposure to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments such as futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps the doddfrank act requires the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market in october 2020 the cftc finalized one of the last remaining new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that institutes broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as finalized these 

rules include exemptions for hedging positions and while we cannot yet predict the full impact of the rules when they take effect in 2022 and 2023 we do not expect that the rules will have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict how new leadership at the cftc as a result of the change in the us presidential administration may impact us 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the clean water act the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal and state environmental laws for both new and existing facilities could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities in general the cost of environmental control at facilities is increasing and limiting the return on capital projects and the number of capital projects that are viable 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the long term trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we record liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or a similar state agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 250 million as of december 31 2020 for additional information related to environmental matters see note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes from time to time the epa as well as other us federal and state regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations or wastes from oil and gas facilities that are currently exempt as exploration and production waste may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons 

the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance” by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of fills and pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of fills and pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal or state authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act the epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 the epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggered a process under which the epa designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the new naaqs standard now certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the new naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newlyinstalled equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units 

climate change 

due to concern over climate change numerous proposals to monitor and limit emissions of ghgs have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the federal state and local levels of government methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of ghgs various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such ghgs including the epa programs to report ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs climaterelated laws and regulation could lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain ghgs including co 2 and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with requirements for reducing reporting and permitting ghg emissions 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co 2 emission performance rates for power generating units that are fueled by coal oil or natural gas the rule has been the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved in october 2017 the epa proposed to repeal the clean power plan in june 2019 the epa replaced the clean power plan with the affordable clean energy rule in january 2021 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the affordable clean energy rule and remanded the question to the epa to consider a new regulatory framework to replace the affordable clean energy rule thereby allowing the incoming administration to implement standards for emissions from the power sector while we do not operate power plants it remains unclear what effect new standards might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional ghg “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented stricter regulations for ghgs that go beyond the requirements of the epa some of the states have implemented regulations that require additional reductions monitoring and reporting of methane emissions depending on the state programs pending implementation we could be required to further reduce emissions conduct additional monitoring do additional emissions reporting install additional emission controls andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of ghgs primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment or emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the ghg emissions pay taxes related to the ghg emissions and administer and manage a more comprehensive ghg emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated companies in our industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions however the timing severity and location of these climate change impacts are not known with certainty and these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over varying time horizons 

because the combustion of natural gas produces lower ghg emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the clean power plan or affordable clean energy rule could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that ghg regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2 business segment however these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts ghg regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined riskbased performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

human capital 

in managing our human capital resources we use a strategic approach to building a diverse inclusive and respectful workplace our human resources department provides expertise and tools to attract develop and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals we value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals challenges and employee concerns 

we employed 10524 fulltime personnel at december 31 2020 including approximately 929 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2021 and 2024 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

we value the safety of our workforce and integrate a culture of safety emergency preparedness and environmental responsibility through our operations management system oms our oms conforms to common industry standards and establishes a framework that helps us i provide employees and contractors with a safe work environment ii comply with laws rules regulations policies and procedures and iii identify opportunities to improve although our ultimate target is zero incidents we also have three nonzero employee safety performance targets the first is to outperform the annual industry average total recordable incident rate trir the second is to outperform our own threeyear trir average the third is a longerterm target to improve our companywide employee trir from 10 in the baseline year 2019 to 07 by 2024 we seek to constantly improve our contractor trir performance through initiatives to address recent incident trends and new best practices 

our board of directors’ nominating and governance committee is responsible for planning for succession in the senior management ranks of the company including the office of chief executive officer the chief executive officer shall report to the committee generally at the time of the regularly scheduled third quarter board of directors meeting in each year regarding the processes in place to identify talent within and outside the company to succeed to senior management positions and the information developed during the current calendar year pursuant to those processes

properties and rights of way 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land generally under agreements that are perpetual or provide for renewal rights substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased by the company

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business 

the covid19 pandemic and the efforts to control it have resulted in a significant decline in global economic activity and significant disruption of global supply chains governments around the world have implemented stringent measures to help reduce the spread of the virus including stayathome orders business and school closures travel restrictions and other measures the resulting downturn in economic activity has negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil natural gas ngl refined petroleum products co 2  steel chemicals and other products that we handle in our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities see item 2 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general—covid19 ” continuing uncertainty regarding the global impact of covid19 is likely to result in continued weakness in demand and prices for the products on which our business depends 

as the pandemic and responses to it continue we may experience further disruptions to commodities markets supply chains and the health availability and efficiency of our workforce which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations and limit our ability to execute on our business plan in addition measures taken by regulatory authorities attempting to mitigate the economic consequences of covid19 may not be effective or may have unintended harmful consequences there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding covid19 — including the pace and efficacy of vaccination efforts the duration and severity of possible resurgences and the duration and extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries — to reasonably predict the potential impact of covid19 on our business and operations covid19 may materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to the global economic recession that is likely to result from the measures taken to combat the virus further adverse impacts from the pandemic may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks we face 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities including the availability of expansion opportunities depend in part on continued production of natural gas crude oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas crude oil ngl refined petroleum products co 2  steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand for example without additions to crude oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput 

commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire additionally demand for such products can decline due to situations over which we have no control such as the covid19 pandemic and various measures that federal state and local authorities have implemented in response to the virus or its economic consequences see “— the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business” 

in addition to economic disruptions resulting from events such as covid19 conditions in the business environment generally such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions or higher development or production costs could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets also sustained lower demand for hydrocarbons or changes in the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products in recent years a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing ghg emissions have been undertaken by federal state and municipal governments and crude oil and gas industry participants in addition public concern about the potential risks posed by climate change has resulted in increased demand for energy efficiency and a transition to energy provided from renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels fuelefficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles and pursuit of other technologies to reduce ghg emissions such as carbon capture and sequestration we may see an intensification of these trends if and to the extent that the new us presidential administration succeeds in enacting its energy and environmental policies 

these factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments furthermore such unfavorable conditions may compound the adverse effects of larger disruptions such as covid19 see “— financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” below 

we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for the products we handle in addition irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us 

we face competition from other pipelines and terminals as well as other forms of transportation and storage 

competition is a factor affecting our existing businesses and our ability to secure new project opportunities any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation such as barge rail or truck that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors likewise competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options or customers opt to construct their own facilities for services previously provided by us this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us if capacity on our assets remains unused our ability to recontract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired in addition to the 

extent that companies pursuing development of carbon capture and sequestration technology are successful they could compete with us for customers who purchase co 2 for use in enhanced oil recovery operations 

the volatility of crude oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses and the carrying values of certain of their respective assets which include related goodwill depend to a large degree on prevailing crude oil ngl and natural gas prices 

prices for crude oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii domestic and global economic conditions iii the activities of the opec and other countries that are significant producers of crude oil “opec” iv governmental regulation v political instability in crude oil producing countries vi the foreign supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports viii the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities and ix the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks we are also subject indirectly to volatility of commodity prices through many of our customers’ direct exposure to such volatility please read “—our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income ” 

in 2020 the impact of covid19 combined with a dispute regarding production levels among opec countries caused crude oil prices to reach historic lows by march 2020 crude oil was priced at less than 25 per barrel the lowest price since april 1999 producers in the us and globally did not reduce crude oil production at a rate sufficient to match the dramatic decline in economic activity that accelerated in march and april 2020 resulting in an oversupply of crude oil that caused the perbarrel price to fall below zero in april 2020 while global oil demand has improved from the low levels experienced during these months last year and opec agreed on production cuts in april 2020 there is no assurance that demand will not decline to these levels again that the opec agreement will continue to be observed by its parties or that the agreed production cuts will be sufficient to offset continuing demand weakness downward pressure on commodity prices could continue for the foreseeable future if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

sharp declines in the prices of crude oil ngl or natural gas such as we experienced in the first half of 2020 or a prolonged unfavorable price environment may result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell crude oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value which includes assigned goodwill of our co 2 business segment’s proved reserves certain assets in certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines business segment and certain assets within our products pipelines business segment for example following the commodity price declines we experienced during the first half of 2020 we recorded a combined 1950 billion of noncash impairments associated with our natural gas pipelines nonregulated and co 2 reporting units primarily for impairments of goodwill and assets owned in these businesses see note 3 “ impairments and losses and gains on divestitures ” and note 8 “ goodwill ” to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

in recent decades there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle such as leaks releases the breakdown underperformance or failure of equipment facilities information systems or processes damage to our pipelines caused by thirdparty construction the compromise of information and control systems spills at 

terminals and hubs spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities adverse sea conditions including storms and rising sea levels and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals operator error labor disputeswork stoppages disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers operational disruptions or apportionment on thirdparty systems or refineries on which our assets depend and catastrophic events or natural disasters such as fires floods explosions earthquakes acts of terrorists and saboteurs cyber security breaches and other similar events many of which are beyond our control additional risks to our vessels include capsizing grounding and navigation errors 

the occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution significant reputational damage impairment or suspension of operations fines or other regulatory penalties and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements any of which also could result in substantial financial losses including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater in addition the consequences of any operational incident including as a result of adverse sea conditions at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines andor the repair of marine terminals 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

as described above covid19 has resulted in a downturn of economic activity on a global scale the slowdown resulting from the pandemic has affected numerous industries including the crude oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services we could experience similar or compounded adverse impacts as a result of other global events affecting economic conditions in addition uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions sustained unfavorable commodity prices volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us see “—financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas are likely to have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “—the volatility of crude oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments” 

if economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets globally in the us or in other key markets become more volatile or continue to deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers the global economic slowdown caused by covid19 and the coinciding extreme drop in crude oil prices which was exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic significantly impacted the financial condition of many companies particularly exploration and production companies including some of our customers or counterparties many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing and some of them may be highly leveraged and may not be able to access additional capital to sustain their operations in the future our counterparties are subject to their own operating market financial and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness crude oil ngl and natural gas prices were all lower on average in 2020 compared to 2019 further deterioration in crude oil prices or a continuation of the existing low natural gas or ngl price environment would likely cause severe financial distress to some of our customers with direct commodity price exposure and may result in additional customer bankruptcies further the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited including by ferc regulation while certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and therefore the parent’s credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers’ ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us see note 2 “ summary of significant accounting policies—allowance for credit losses ” in our consolidated financial statements 

furthermore financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts owed to us similarly our contracts with such customers may be renegotiated at lower rates or terminated altogether significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion 

our business operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects in addition market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders potential impacts of negative public opinion or reputational issues may include delays or stoppages in expansion projects legal or regulatory actions or challenges blockades increased regulatory oversight reduced support from regulatory authorities challenges to regulatory approvals difficulty securing financing for and cost overruns affecting expansion projects and the degradation of our business generally 

reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk credit market operational insurance regulatory and legal risks among others must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry particularly other energy infrastructure providers over which we have no control in particular our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase ghg emissions and contribute to climate change negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion including with respect to the production transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally could include revenue loss reduction in customer base delays in obtaining or challenges to regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects and decreased value of our securities and our business 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2 business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our direct exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas and ngl including differentials between regional markets these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl furthermore our hedging arrangements cannot hedge against any decrease in the volumes of products we handle see “ —our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle” 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent thenexisting underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions limiting our ability to hedge our exposure to unfavorable commodity prices 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those consolidated financial statements in addition it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices therefore our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—hedging activities ” and note 14 “ risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational it systems or those of third parties may adversely affect our business results of operations or business reputation 

our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions some of the operational systems we use are owned or operated by independent thirdparty vendors the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems collecting and storing information and data processing transactions and handling other processing necessary to manage our business 

while we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our it and data systems from such attacks we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program will be effective in compliance with state and local stayathome orders issued in connection with covid19 a number of our employees have transitioned to working from home as a result more of our employees are working from locations where our cybersecurity program may be less effective and it security may be less robust we have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization the risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations through an act of terrorism or cyber sabotage event has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations a significant failure compromise breach or interruption in our systems which may result from problems such as malware computer viruses hacking attempts or thirdparty error or malfeasance could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues efforts by us and our vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures including malware and antivirus software and controls may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and any network and information systemsrelated events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

attacks including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage or the threat of such attacks may adversely affect our business or reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events for example in 2018 a cyber attack on a shared data network forced four us natural gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers potential targets include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems the occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters as well as subsidence and coastal erosion and climaterelated physical risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion these natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of weather and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding these climaterelated changes could result in damage to physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions in addition we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” 

our insurance policies do not cover all losses costs or liabilities that we may experience and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums 

our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost there is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of nonrenewal the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining or our inability to obtain permits and rightsofway as well as public opposition increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns inclement weather and other delays should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others we will share control of and any benefits from those projects 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets new growth projects generally will be subject to among other things the receipt of regulatory approvals feasibility and cost analyses funding availability and industry market and demand conditions if we pursue joint ventures with third parties those parties may share approval rights over major decisions and may act in their own interests their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses which in turn could affect the 

financial expectations of and our expected benefits from the venture a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals have caused and may continue to cause delays in or cancellations of our construction projects regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects such as the ferc’s consideration of changes to its certificate policy statement such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects see “— we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion ” for example changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rightsofway or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns or delays or our inability to obtain a required permit or rightofway could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the us have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets we evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate 

if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i the loss of key customers of the acquired business ii demands on management related to the increase in our size iii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iv difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting budgeting reporting internal controls and other systems and v difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the 

knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders steve kean our chief executive officer and kim dang our president along with the other members of our senior management messrs kinder and kean and ms dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean ms dang or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 334 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ evolving policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossilfuel energy companies which has resulted in certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in such companies ultimately this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 52 billion of our approximately 334 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps our interest rate swaps as of december 31 2020 include 25 billion of variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements and 900 million of fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021 should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service variablerate debt would increase as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures if our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to regulation 

the ferc or state public utility commissions such as the cpuc may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc state public utility commissions or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc or state public utility commissions to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact on our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to 

those described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability additional regulatory burdens and uncertainties will be created if and to the extent that the new us presidential administration succeeds in enacting more stringent energy and environmental policies for example on january 27 2021 the president issued an executive order directing among other matters the reevaluation of the leasing program for federally managed lands and the “pause” of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of the review these and other initiatives of the new presidential administration may affect our assets and operations directly or indirectly such as by preventing or delaying the exploration for and production of natural gas and liquids that we transport 

regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state and local taxation ii rates which include tax reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the costs of raw materials such as steel which may be affected by tariffs or otherwise vii the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations viii acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses ix the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities x reporting and information posting requirements xi the maintenance of accounts and records and xii relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—industry regulation ” 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our past present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act the oil pollution act or analogous state laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could harm our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows 

we own andor operate numerous properties and equipment that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties and equipment owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes 

have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us for example the federal clean air act and other similar federal and state laws are subject to periodic review and amendment which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity at the federal and state level there are for example federal guidelines issued by the us department of transportation dot for pipeline companies in the areas of operations testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climaterelated risk and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of ghgs such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report ghg emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2 for example from our mcelmo dome co 2 field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further address ghg emissions include establishing ghg “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards participation in international climate agreements issuance of executive orders by the us presidential administration and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our ghg emissions pay taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for 

hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could result in damage to our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including activity on public lands and hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas including lands that are federally managed policy and regulatory initiatives of the new presidential administration or legislation by congress may decrease access to federally managed lands and increase the regulatory burdens associated with using these lands to produce crude oil or natural gas for example on january 20 2021 the secretary of the department of the interior issued an order temporarily restricting the authorization of new leases or permits to drill without the approval of a senior department official on january 27 2021 the president issued an executive order directing among other matters the reevaluation of the leasing program for federally managed lands and the “pause” of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of the review 

the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent in areas where we have operations oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements related not only to well development but also to compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and crewed by predominately us citizens our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock these reflect our current judgment but as with any estimate they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report if our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions ” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders

general 

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future we have four business segments as further described below 

natural gas pipelines 

this segment owns and operates i major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems ii natural gas gathering systems and processing and treating facilities iii ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems and iv lng regasification liquefaction and storage facilities 

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under longterm fixed contracts to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 83 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2020 the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts held by assets we own and have equity interests in including intrastate pipelines’ sales portfolio was approximately six years our lng regasification and liquefaction and associated storage contracts are subscribed under longterm agreements with a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 13 years 

our midstream assets provide natural gas gathering and processing services these assets are mostly feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into its base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to feebased arrangements some of which may include minimum volume commitments we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

products pipelines 

this segment owns and operates refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver among other products gasoline diesel and jet fuel crude oil and condensate to various markets this segment also owns andor operates associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have 49 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biodiesel the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines and terminals located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index and a ferc index rate 

our crude condensate and refined petroleum products transportation services are primarily provided pursuant to i either ferc or state tariffs and ii longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however the revenues and earnings we realize from our pipelines and terminals are affected by the volumes of crude oil refined petroleum 

products and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity and product demand in the respective regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

terminals 

this segment owns and operates i liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the us that store and handle various commodities including gasoline diesel fuel chemicals ethanol metals and petroleum coke and ii jones actqualified tankers 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipelines business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which on average is approximately three years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 

as with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are petroleum coke metals and ores in addition the majority of our contracts for this business contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated events including hurricanes may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones actqualified tankers in our terminals business segment as of december 31 2020 we have sixteen jones actqualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are primarily operating pursuant to multiyear fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

co 2 

this segment i manages the production transportation and marketing of co 2 to oil fields that use co 2 as a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields ii owns interests in andor operates oil fields and gasoline processing plants in west texas and iii owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system in west texas 

the co 2 source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2020 had a remaining average contract life of approximately eight years co 2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2020 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2021 budget approximately 100 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price our success in this portion of the co 2 business segment can be impacted by the demand for co 2  in the co 2 business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add the revenues we receive from our crude oil and ngl sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 5378 per barrel in 2020 and 4949 per barrel in 2019 had we not used energy derivative 

contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 3832 per barrel in 2020 and 5512 per barrel in 2019 

also see note 15 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about the types of contracts and revenues recognized for each of our segments 

sale of us portion of cochin pipeline system and kml 

on december 16 2019 we closed on two crossconditional transactions resulting in the sale of the us portion of the cochin pipeline system and all the outstanding equity of kml including our 70 interest to pembina pipeline corporation pembina together the “kml and us cochin sale” we received approximately 25 million shares of pembina common equity for our interest in kml on january 9 2020 we sold our shares of pembina and received proceeds of approximately 907 million 764 million after tax which were used to repay maturing debt the assets sold were part of our natural gas pipelines and terminals business segments 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemicrelated reduction in energy demand and the dramatic decline in commodity prices that began to impact us in the first quarter of 2020 continued to cause disruptions and volatility sharp declines in crude oil and natural gas production along with reduced demand for refined products due to the economic shutdown in the wake of the pandemic affected our business and continues to do so while we have seen some meaningful recovery during the second half of the year in demand for refined products that we move through our terminals significant uncertainty remains regarding the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic on the energy industry including demand and prices for the products handled by our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities although we expect to see further recovery as vaccines are distributed and more normal societal activity resumes 

the events as described above resulted in decreases of current and estimated longterm crude oil and ngl sale prices and volumes we expect to realize and in significant reductions to the market capitalization of many midstream and oil and gas producing companies these events triggered us to review the carrying value of our longlived assets and recoverability of goodwill for interim periods in addition to our annual testing our evaluations resulted in the recognition during the first six months of 2020 of a 350 million impairment for longlived assets in our co 2 business segment and goodwill impairments of 1000 million and 600 million to our natural gas pipelines nonregulated and co 2 reporting units respectively for a further discussion of these impairments and our risk for future impairments see note 3 “ impairments and losses and gains on divestitures ” 

we have placed a priority on protecting our employees during this pandemic while continuing to provide essential services to our customers we continue to follow the centers for disease control guidelines for those employees that perform essential tasks in our operations and have taken a cautious enterprisewide approach with a phased return to workplace process for our employees who are currently working remotely during 2020 our incremental employee safety costs associated with covid19 mitigation were approximately 15 million primarily for personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning protocols temperature screening and other measures we adopted to protect our employees we continue to operate our assets safely and efficiently during this challenging period 

2021 dividends and discretionary capital 

we expect to declare dividends of 108 per share for 2021 a 3 increase from the 2020 declared dividends of 105 per share we also expect to invest 08 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2021 

the expectations for 2021 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “ risk factors ” below and “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to these 2021 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or 

affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition ii income taxes iii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iv the fair values used in a calculations of possible asset and equity investment impairment charges and b calculation for the annual goodwill impairment test or interim tests if triggered v reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities vi provisions for credit losses vii computation of the gain or loss if any on assets sold in whole or in part and viii exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

environmental matters 

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

our accrual of environmental liabilities often coincides either with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our probable environmental liabilities if necessary or appropriate following quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations in recording and adjusting environmental liabilities we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see part i items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

legal and regulatory matters 

many of our operations are regulated by various us regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities that are probable we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

longlived asset and equity investment impairments 

we evaluate longlived assets including leases and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount of an asset or investment may not be recoverable we recognize impairment losses when estimated future cash flows expected to result from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount because the impairment test for longlived assets held in use is based on undiscounted cash flows there may be instances where an asset or asset group is not considered impaired even when its fair value may be less than its carrying value because the asset or asset group is recoverable based on the cash flows to be generated over the estimated life of the asset 

or asset group if the carrying value of a longlived asset or asset group is in excess of undiscounted cash flows we typically use discounted cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment is required 

for more information on our longlived asset impairments and significant estimates and assumptions used in our evaluations see note 3 “impairments and losses and gains on divestitures” 

intangible assets 

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts and relationships and agreements these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

for more information on our 2020 goodwill impairment evaluations and amortizable intangibles see note 3 “impairments and losses and gains on divestitures” and note 8 “goodwill” to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging activities 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices foreign currency exposure on eurodenominated debt and until our recent divestitures of our canadian assets net investments in foreign operations and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these derivative contracts are or were in respect to our canadian operations generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged risk and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument by using a systematic and rational method 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2020 our pension plans were underfunded by 645 million and our opeb plans were overfunded by 62 million our pension and opeb obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and opeb plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits ” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and opeb can be and have been revised in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected 

future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2020 we had deferred net losses of approximately 521 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and opeb plans 

the following sensitivity analysis shows the estimated impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and opeb plans for the year ended december 31 2020 



a includes amounts deferred as either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations 

income taxes 

income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments including kmi’s investment in its whollyowned subsidiary kmp 

results of operations 

overview 

as described in further detail below our management evaluates our performance primarily using the gaap financial measures of segment ebda as presented in note 16 “ reportable segments ” net income and net income attributable to kinder morgan inc along with the nongaap financial measures of adjusted earnings and dcf both in the aggregate and per share for each adjusted segment ebda adjusted ebitda net debt and net debt to adjusted ebitda 

gaap financial measures 

the consolidated earnings results for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 present segment ebda net income and net income attributable to kinder morgan inc which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as unallocated employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap financial measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

certain items 

certain items as adjustments used to calculate our nongaap financial measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses we also include adjustments related to joint ventures see “amounts from joint ventures” below and the tables included in “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income gaap to adjusted ebitda” and “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information” below in addition certain items are described in more detail in the footnotes to tables included in “—segment earnings results” and “—dda general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests” below 

adjusted earnings 

adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of our ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income attributable to kinder morgan inc adjusted earnings per share uses adjusted earnings and applies the same twoclass method used in arriving at basic earnings per common share see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” below 

dcf 

dcf is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for certain items adjusted earnings and further by dda and amortization of excess cost of equity investments income tax expense cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items we also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes dda and sustaining capital expenditures see “amounts from joint ventures” below dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income attributable to kinder morgan inc dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in common share dividends see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” and “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” below 

adjusted segment ebda 

adjusted segment ebda is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for certain items attributable to the segment adjusted segment ebda is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business we believe adjusted segment ebda is a useful performance metric because it provides management and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted segment ebda is segment ebda see “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” for a reconciliation of segment ebda to adjusted segment ebda by business segment 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items we also include amounts from joint ventures for income taxes and dda see “amounts from joint ventures” below adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt as described further below to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income see “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” and “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income gaap to adjusted ebitda” below  

amounts from joint ventures 

certain items dcf and adjusted ebitda reflect amounts from unconsolidated joint ventures and consolidated joint ventures utilizing the same recognition and measurement methods used to record “earnings from equity investments” and “noncontrolling interests” respectively the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda related to our unconsolidated and consolidated joint ventures include the same adjustments dda and income tax expense and for dcf only also cash taxes and sustaining capital expenditures with respect to the joint ventures as those included in the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda for our whollyowned consolidated subsidiaries see “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information” below although these amounts related to our unconsolidated joint ventures are included in the calculations of dcf and adjusted ebitda such inclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues expenses or cash flows of such unconsolidated joint ventures dcf and adjusted ebitda are further adjusted for certain kml activities attributable to our noncontrolling interests in kml for the periods presented through kml’s sale on december 16 2019 see “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information—kml activities prior to december 16 2019” below 

net debt 

net debt is calculated based on amounts as of december 31 2020 by subtracting the following amounts from our debt balance of 34689 million i cash and cash equivalents of 1184 million ii debt fair value adjustments of 1293 million and iii the foreign exchange impact on eurodenominated bonds of 170 million for which we have entered into currency swaps net debt is a nongaap financial measure that is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage we believe the most comparable measure to net debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio was 46 as of december 31 2020 

consolidated earnings results gaap 

the following tables summarize the key components of our consolidated earnings results 



a includes revenues earnings from equity investments and other net less operating expenses loss gain on impairments and divestitures net and other income net operating expenses include costs of sales operations and maintenance expenses and taxes other than income taxes 

year ended december 31 2020 vs 2019 

net income attributable to kinder morgan inc decreased 2071 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was due primarily to 1950 million of noncash impairments of goodwill associated with our natural gas pipelines nonregulated and co 2 reporting units and noncash impairments of certain oil and gas producing assets in our co 2 business segment the decrease in results was further impacted by lower earnings from all of our business segments primarily attributable to covid19related reduced energy demand and commodity price impacts and the impact of the kml and us cochin sale in the fourth quarter of 2019 on our natural gas pipelines and terminals business segments partially offset by the benefit of completed expansion projects in our natural gas pipelines business segment by lower interest expense and dda expense and by lower income tax expense due to 2019 income taxes related to the kml and us cochin sale

year ended december 31 2020 versus year ended december 31 2019 



the changes in segment ebda for our natural gas pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving adjusted segment ebda in the comparable years of 2020 and 2019 

• midstream’s decrease of 254 million 18 was primarily due to i a decrease of 142 million related to the sale of the cochin pipeline system on december 16 2019 to pembina ii lower commodity prices on a decrease in volumes and two customer bankruptcies associated with our south texas assets iii lower volumes on kinderhawk and iv lower contract rates on our north texas assets these decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings due to the gulf coast express pipeline being placed in service in september 2019 overall midstream’s revenues decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices which was largely offset by corresponding decreases in costs of sales 

• west region’s decrease of 47 million 4 was primarily due to decreases in earnings from i ruby pipeline company llc due principally to credit losses and lost revenues resulting from two of its customers’ bankruptcies ii cpgpl as a result of the expiration of one shipper’s contract and iii epng driven by higher operating expenses and 

• east region’s increase of 157 million 7 was primarily due to increases in earnings from elc and slng resulting from the liquefaction units of the elba liquefaction project gradually being placed into service in the later part of 2019 and through the first eight months of 2020 and increased equity earnings from ngpl primarily due to higher revenues these increases were partially offset by reduced contributions from tgp due to the impact of the ferc 501g rate settlement on its revenues

the changes in segment ebda for our products pipelines business segment are further explained by the following discussion of the significant factors driving adjusted segment ebda in the comparable years of 2020 and 2019 

• crude and condensate’s decrease of 119 million 25 was primarily due to decreased earnings from kinder morgan crude  condensate pipeline kmcc and the bakken crude assets kmcc’s decreased earnings were primarily due to lower volumes the bakken crude assets decreased earnings were primarily driven by lower volumes and reduced 

recontracted rates on double h pipeline kmcc and bakken crude assets decreases were also impacted by unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments driven by declines in commodity prices during the first quarter 2020 

• west coast refined products’ decrease of 63 million 12 was due to decreased earnings on pacific sfpp operations calnev pipe line llc and west coast terminals driven by lower service revenues as a result of a reduction in volumes due to covid19 and 

• southeast refined products’ decrease of 49 million 18 was primarily due to decreased earnings from our south east terminals and a decrease in equity earnings from ppl pipeline as a result of decreased services revenues driven by lower volumes and prices due to covid19 and lower earnings from our transmix processing operations driven by unfavorable inventory adjustments resulting from commodity price declines during the first quarter 2020

dda expense decreased 247 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to larger noncash impairments taken in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 on our oil and gas producing assets lower co 2 business segment oil and gas production and the sale of kml partially offset by our elba liquefaction project gradually placed into service during 2019 and 2020 

general and administrative expenses and corporate charges adjusted for certain items decreased 37 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower noncash pension expenses of 45 million lower expenses of 31 million due to the kml and us cochin sale and 20 million of cost savings associated with efficiency efforts and reduced activity during the pandemic partially offset by lower capitalized costs of 57 million reflecting reduced capital projects primarily in our natural gas pipelines co 2 and products pipelines business segments 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net adjusted for certain items decreased 206 million in 2020 when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower weighted average longterm debt balances and lower libor rates partially offset by lower capitalized interest 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2020 and 2019 approximately 16 and 27 respectively of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “ risk management—interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests adjusted for certain items increased 8 million in 2020 compared to 2019 

income taxes 

year ended december 31 2020 versus year ended december 31 2019 

our income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2020 is approximately 481 million as compared with income tax expense of 926 million for the same period of 2019 the 445 million decrease in income tax expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 is due primarily to i lower pretax income in 2020 ii lower foreign income taxes as a result of the kml and us cochin sale in 2019 and iii the refund of alternative minimum tax sequestration credits in 2020 these decreases are partially offset by the lack of tax benefit on the higher impairment of nontax deductible goodwill in 2020 and lower dividendreceived deductions related to our investment in ngpl in 2020

as of december 31 2020 we had 1184 million of “cash and cash equivalents” an increase of 999 million from december 31 2019 additionally as of december 31 2020 we had borrowing capacity of approximately 39 billion under our 4 billion revolving credit facility discussed below in “ —shortterm liquidity ” as discussed further below we believe our cash flows from operating activities cash position and remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility are more than adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4550 million and 4748 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the yeartoyear decrease is discussed below in “ —cash flows—operating activities ” we primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures dividend payments and our growth capital expenditures we believe our current cash on hand our cash from operations and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are more than adequate to allow us to manage 

our cash requirements including maturing debt through 2021 however we may access the debt capital markets from time to time to refinance our maturing longterm debt 

our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 02625 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 consistent with previous quarters in 2020 the total of the dividends declared for 2020 of 105 represents a 5 increase over total dividends declared for 2019 we expect to fully fund our dividend payments as well as our discretionary spending for 2021 without funding from the capital markets with additional flexibility to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2020 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i cash from operations ii our 40 billion revolving credit facility and associated commercial paper program and iii cash and cash equivalents the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program letters of credit and commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and as previously discussed have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations we do not anticipate any significant limitations from the continuing impacts of covid19 with respect to our ability to access funding through our credit facility 

as of december 31 2020 our 2558 million of shortterm debt consisted primarily of senior notes that mature in the next twelve months we intend to fund our debt as it becomes due primarily through credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings cash flows from operations andor issuing new longterm debt our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2019 was 2477 million 

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 1871 million and 1862 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively from time to time our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor pay down using retained cash from operations the overall slight 9 million unfavorable change from yearend 2019 was primarily due to i a decrease of 925 million related to the sale of pembina common equity in january 2020 ii an increase of approximately 216 million in senior notes that mature in the next twelve months and iii the 100 million repayment of the preferred interest in kinder morgan gp inc substantially offset by i an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 999 million and ii a favorable asset fair value adjustment of 101 million on derivative contracts in 2020 generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “ —longterm financing ” and “ —capital expenditures ” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings generally we anticipate refinancing maturing longterm debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings a decrease in our credit ratings could negatively impact our borrowing costs and could limit our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities 

as of december 31 2020 our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a2 prime2 and f2 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2020 



longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock with a par value of 001 per share we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our discretionary capital investments for the foreseeable future see also “— dividends and stock buyback program ” below for additional discussion related to our dividends and stock buyback program 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries issue longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee each other’s debt see “ —summarized combined financial information for guarantee of securities of subsidiaries  as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 30838 million and 30883 million respectively 

on august 5 2020 we issued in a registered offering two series of senior notes consisting of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 200 senior notes due 2031 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 325 senior notes due 2050 and received combined net proceeds of 1226 million we used the proceeds to repay maturing debt including in early january 2021 our 750 million 350 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in march 2021 

to refinance construction costs of its recent expansions on february 24 2020 tgp a wholly owned subsidiary issued in a private placement 1000 million aggregate principal amount of its 290 senior notes due 2030 and received net proceeds of 991 million 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

for additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debtrelated transactions in 2020  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

counterparty creditworthiness 

some of our customers or other counterparties may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness these financial problems may arise from our current global economic conditions continued volatility of commodity prices or otherwise in such situations we utilize to the extent allowable under applicable contracts tariffs and regulations prepayments and other security requirements such as letters of credit to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these counterparties while we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect against counterparty credit risk we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our customers or other counterparties will not become financially distressed and will not default on their obligations to us the balance of our allowance for credit losses as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 was  26 million and  9 million respectively reflected in “other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets which includes reserves for counterparty bankruptcies recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 

capital expenditures 

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “ —results of operations—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income attributable to kinder morgan inc gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf ” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2020 and the amount we expect to spend for 2021 to sustain our assets and grow our business are as follows 



a 2020 and expected 2021 amounts include 114 million and 119 million respectively for sustaining capital expenditures from unconsolidated joint ventures reduced by consolidated joint venture partners’ sustaining capital expenditures see table included in “ nongaap financial measures—supplemental information ” 

b 2020 excludes 21 million due to decreases in accrued capital expenditures and contractor retainage and net changes in other 

c 2020 amount includes 550 million of our contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures for capital investments and small acquisitions 

d amounts include our actual or estimated contributions to certain unconsolidated joint ventures net of actual or estimated contributions from certain partners in nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries for capital investments

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 198 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• a 409 million decrease in cash after adjusting the 2059 million decrease in net income by 1650 million for the combined effects of the periodtoperiod net changes in noncash items including the following i loss on impairments and divestitures net see discussion above in “—results of operations” ii changes in fair market value of derivative contracts iii dda expenses including amortization of excess cost of equity investments iv deferred income taxes and v earnings from equity investments partially offset by 

• a 145 million increase in cash primarily resulting from 227 million of net income tax payments in the 2020 period compared to 372 million of net income tax payments in the 2019 period which in both periods were primarily for foreign income taxes associated with the sale of certain canadian assets the income tax payments for the 2020 period are net of a 20 million refund related to alternative minimum tax sequestration credits and 

• a 66 million increase in cash associated with net changes in working capital items other than income tax payments and other noncurrent assets and liabilities the increase was driven among other things primarily by a favorable change due to the timing of trade payables payments and partially offset by higher pension plan contributions we made in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities decreased 803 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

◦ a 959 million increase in cash from the proceeds received from the sales of property plant and equipment investments and other net assets net of removal costs primarily due to 907 million of proceeds received from the sale of the pembina shares in the 2020 period see note 4 “divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction 

◦ a 913 million decrease in cash used for contributions to equity investments driven by lower contributions to gulf coast express pipeline llc mep citrus and fep in the 2020 period compared with the 2019 period partially offset by contributions made to sng in the 2020 period and 

◦ a 563 million decrease in capital expenditures in the 2020 period over the comparative 2019 period primarily due to lower expenditures on the elba liquefaction expansion and also reflecting our reduction of expansion capital projects in the wake of covid19 partially offset by 

◦ the 1527 million decrease in cash resulting from proceeds received from the kml and us cochin sale net of cash disposed in 2019 see note 4 “divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction and 

◦ a 179 million decrease in distributions received from equity investments in excess of cumulative earnings primarily from ruby fep and sng in the 2020 period over the comparative 2019 period 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities decreased 3547 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 

• a 3065 million net increase in cash from net debt activity primarily driven by an increase in longterm debt issuances and to a lesser extent lower longterm debt repayments and lower utilization of our credit facility for shortterm borrowings which resulted in a substantial decrease in each our total debt issuances and total debt payments in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt activity and 

• an 879 million decrease in cash used resulting from the distribution of the tmpl sale proceeds to the owners of kml restricted voting shares in the 2019 period partially offset by 

• a 199 million increase in dividend payments to our common shareholders and 

• a 137 million decrease in contributions received from an investment partner and noncontrolling interests primarily driven by lower contributions received from eig in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period 

dividends and stock buyback program 

the table below reflects the declaration of common stock dividends of 105 per common share for 2020 



we expect to continue to return additional value to our shareholders in 2021 through our previously announced dividend increase we plan to increase our dividend by 3 to 108 per common share in 2021 based on our 2021 expectations we also expect to have the capacity to engage in opportunistic share repurchases up to 450 million during the year under our 2 billion common share buyback program approved by our board of directors in july 2017 since december 2017 in total we have repurchased approximately 32 million of our class p shares under the program at an average price of approximately 1771 per share for approximately 575 million for information on our equity buyback program and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

the actual amount of common stock dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “ risk factors—the guidance we provide 

for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common stock dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

energy commodity market risk 

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of crude oil natural gas and ngl the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil natural gas and ngl we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets 

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



we measure the risk of price changes in the derivative instrument portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values because we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value 



our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil natural gas and ngl portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances including debt fair value adjustments and as of december 31 2019 the preferred interest in kmp held by kmgp that was redeemed on january 15 2020 and sensitivity to interest rates 



a a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt as of december 31 2020 and 2019 would result in changes of approximately 1541 million and 1548 million respectively in the estimated fair values of these instruments 

b december 31 2020 amount includes 25 billion of variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021 

c december 31 2020 amount includes 900 million of fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements that expire during 2021 

d a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 49 and 53 basis points respectively in 2020 and 2019 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2020 and 2019 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 25 million and 47 million respectively in our 2020 and 2019 annual income before income taxes 

e fair values were determined using level 2 inputs 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

as presented in the table above we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2020 including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 16 of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

libor phase out 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to us dollar libor “usd libor” depending on our selection of repayment options and certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to onemonth libor or threemonth libor in july 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced a desire to phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee consisting of large us financial institutions convened by the us federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr an index supported by shortterm treasury repurchase agreements on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” the administrator of usd libor announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining usd libor tenors until june 30 2023 providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on libor to mature 

the agreement governing our revolving credit facility includes provisions to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary during its term which require that we and our administrative agent agree upon a replacement rate based on the thenprevailing market convention for similar agreements which rate is not objected to by lenders holding a majority of the revolving commitments the international swaps and derivatives association has developed provisions for sofrbased fallback rates to apply upon permanent cessation of libor and has published a protocol to enable market participants to include the new provisions in existing swap agreements 

we currently do not expect the transition from libor to have a material impact on us 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2020 we had a notional principal amount of 1358 million of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixedrate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

financings 

during 2019 we repaid approximately 28 billion of maturing debt with cash proceeds received from the sales of tmpl and the us portion of the cochin pipeline aftertax proceeds received in january 2020 from the sale of pembina stock received from the sale of kml will be used to pay down debt in early 2020 

2020 outlook 

we expect to declare dividends of 125 per share for 2020 a 25 increase from the 2019 declared dividends of 100 per share generate approximately 51 billion of dcf or 224 of dcf per share and 76 billion of adjusted ebitda we also expect to invest 24 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2020 our discretionary spending will be primarily funded with excess internally generated cash flow with no need to access equity markets during 2020 we expect that our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio for 2020 yearend will be 43 times see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—nongaap financial measures ” 

we do not provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders or budgeted net income the gaap financial measures most directly comparable to the nongaap financial measures of dcf and adjusted ebitda respectively due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities 

our expectations for 2020 assume average annual prices for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas of 5500 per barrel and 250 per mmbtu respectively consistent with the forward pricing during our 2020 budget process the vast majority of revenue we generate is supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co 2 segment in which we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil and ngl production to minimize this sensitivity for 2020  we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately 5 million each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact dcf by approximately 1 million and each 1 change in the ratio of the weighted average ngl price per barrel to the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact dcf by approximately 2 million 

in addition our expectations for 2020 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “ risk factors ” below and “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2020 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis

competition 

the market for natural gas infrastructure is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve demand for natural gas in the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment we compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service flexibility availability of alternative forms of energy and reliability of service from time to time projects are proposed that compete with our existing assets whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability is typically not known 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including renewables such as wind and solar oil coal and nuclear several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of supply other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

products pipelines 

our products pipelines business segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes the significant products pipelines business segment assets that we own and operate as of december 31 2019  



 

 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline and terminal operations compete against proprietary pipelines and terminals owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines and terminals trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products our railcars and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

terminals 

our terminals business segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product chemical ethanol and other liquid terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines business segment and all of our petroleum coke metal and ores facilities our terminals are located throughout the us primarily near large urban centers we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition our terminals’ marine operations include jones actqualified product 

tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined petroleum products between us ports the following summarizes our terminals business segment assets as of december 31 2019  



competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in north america based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil chemical pipeline and refining companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services in some locations competitors are smaller independent operators with lower cost structures our jones actqualified product tankers compete with other jones actqualified vessel fleets 

co 2   

our co 2 business segment produces transports and markets co 2 for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2 pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co 2 supply and transportation services to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

source and transportation activities 

co 2 resource interests 

our principal market for co 2 is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin our ownership of co 2 resources as of december 31 2019 includes 



 

 

co 2 pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2 pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2 for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable in the foreseeable future the tariffs charged on i the wink crude oil pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission ii the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline are regulated by the texas railroad commission and iii the cortez pipeline are based on a consent decree our other co 2 pipelines are not regulated 

our ownership of co 2 and crude oil pipelines as of december 31 2019 includes 



 

 

oil and gas producing activities 

oil producing interests 

our ownership interests in oilproducing fields located in the permian basin of west texas as of december 31 2019 include the following 



 

 

our oil and gas producing activities are not significant therefore we do not include the supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities under accounting standards codification topic 932 extractive activities  oil and gas 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

owned and operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas as of december 31 2019 include 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2 include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2 resources our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other co 2 pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2 to the denver city texas market area 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base for each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulation 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

as an owner and operator of natural gas companies subject to the natural gas act of 1938 we are required to provide service to shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities at regulated rates that have been determined by the ferc to be just and reasonable recourse rates and general terms and conditions for service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the ferc for each pipeline including storage facilities or companies as used herein generally recourse rates are based on our cost of service including recovery of and a return on our investment posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without ferc authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement the ferc can initiate proceedings on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates upon mutual agreement the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates that are not bound by and are irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreedupon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates the actual negotiated rate agreement or a summary of such agreement must be posted as part of the pipelines’ tariffs while pipelines and their shippers may agree to a variety of negotiated rate structures depending on the shipper and circumstance pipelines generally must use for all shippers the form of service agreement that is contained within their fercapproved tariff any deviation from the pro forma service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations in the terms and conditions of service are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980s the ferc adopted a number of regulatory changes to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace examples include ferc regulations requiring interstate natural gas pipelines to separate their 

traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas customers also natural gas pipelines must separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide ie for transportation services and storage services for natural gas to ensure a competitive transportation market these pipelines must adhere to certain scheduling procedures accept capacity segmentation in certain circumstances and abide by fercestablished standards of conduct when communicating with marketing affiliates 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common liquids carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common liquids carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our sfpp operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the sfpp pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a petroleum products or crude oil pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our west coast refined products operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the west coast refined products operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission of mexico the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitation i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  national agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations issued by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas and moderate consequence areas or mcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

during september 2019 phmsa finalized rules to be effective july 1 2020 to expand integrity management program requirements to hazardous liquids pipelines outside of hcas with some exceptions and to make certain other changes to those program requirements including data integration and emphasis on the use of inline inspection technology during october 2019 phmsa finalized rules to require operators of natural gas pipelines to i expand integrity management program requirements outside of hcas with some exceptions and ii reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure maop on certain pipelines in populated areas including hcas the maop reconfirmations must be completed by 2035 changes in technology such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to phmsa regulations can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations the costs to comply with integrity management program requirements are difficult to predict tests performed as part of our program could result in significant capital and operating expenditures for upgrades andor repairs deemed necessary to continue the safe and reliable operation of our pipelines we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with these phmsa regulations 

the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or “pipes act of 2016” requires phmsa among other regulators to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to set more stringent standards for intrastate pipelines in compliance with the pipes act of 2016 we have implemented procedures for underground natural gas storage facilities 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the future in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines or facilities may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are fulfilling the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

certain of our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may result in claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution thirdparty claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in the us congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreignflagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the us secretary of transportation upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

canadian regulation 

the utopia pipeline system owned by a joint venture that we operate and in which we own a 50 interest originates in ohio and terminates in windsor ontario canada and is therefore subject to us regulation as described in this section and below under the heading “ —environmental matters ” as well as similar regulations promulgated by canadian authorities with respect to natural gas liquids pipelines 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the clean water act the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal and state environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the long term trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we record liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 259 million as of december 31 2019  our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately 259 million to approximately 428 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes from time to time the epa as well as other us federal and state regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations or wastes from oil and gas facilities that are currently exempt as exploration and production waste may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance” by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially 

responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of fills and pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of fills and pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal or state authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act the epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 the epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggered a process under which the epa designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the new naaqs standard now certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the new naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newlyinstalled equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units 

climate change 

due to concern over climate change numerous proposals to monitor and limit emissions of ghgs have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the federal state and local levels of government methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of ghgs various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such ghgs including the epa programs to report ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain ghgs including co 2 and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with ghg emissions reporting and permitting requirements 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co 2 emission performance rates for power generating units that are fueled by coal oil or natural gas the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved in october 2017 the epa proposed to repeal the clean power plan in august 2018 the epa proposed to replace the clean power plan and affordable clean energy rule the ultimate determination of the clean power plan and affordable clean energy rule remains uncertain while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan or the affordable clean energy rule it remains unclear what effect a final rule if it comes into force might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional ghg “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been 

focused on large sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented stricter regulations for ghgs that go beyond the requirements of the epa some of the states have implemented regulations that require additional monitoring and reporting of methane emissions depending on the state programs pending implementation we could be required to conduct additional monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of ghgs primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment or emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the ghg emissions pay taxes related to the ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated companies in our industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions however the timing severity and location of these climate change impacts are not known with certainty and these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over varying time horizons 

because the combustion of natural gas produces less ghg emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the clean power plan or affordable clean energy rule could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that ghg regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2 business segment however these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts ghg regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined riskbased performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees 

we employed 11086 fulltime personnel at december 31 2019  including approximately 954 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2020 and 2023 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to 

our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land generally under agreements that are perpetual or provide for renewal rights substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased by the company

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities including the availability of expansion opportunities depend in part on continued production of natural gas oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas oil ngl refined petroleum products co 2  steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand for example without additions to oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity 

prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions or higher development or production costs could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets in addition changes in the overall demand for hydrocarbons the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products in recent years a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing ghg emissions have been undertaken by federal state and municipal governments and oil and gas industry participants in addition public sentiment surrounding the potential risks posed by climate change and emerging technologies have resulted in an increased demand for energy efficiency and a transition to energy provided from renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels and fuelefficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles these factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments see “— financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” below 

we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for the products we handle in addition irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us see “— the ferc or the cpuc may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us ” 

expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining or our inability to obtain permits and rightsofway as well as public opposition increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns inclement weather and other delays should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others we will share control of and any benefits from those projects 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets new growth projects generally will be subject to among other things the receipt of regulatory approvals feasibility and cost analyses funding availability and industry market and demand conditions if we pursue joint ventures with third parties those parties may share approval rights over major decisions and may act in their own interests their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses which in turn could affect the financial expectations of and our expected benefits from the venture a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals have caused and may continue to cause delays in or cancellations of our construction projects regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects such as the ferc’s consideration of changes to its certificate policy statement such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects see “— we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion ” for example changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rightsofway or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns or delays or our inability to obtain a required permit or rightofway could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

we face competition from other pipelines and terminals as well as other forms of transportation and storage 

competition is a factor affecting our existing businesses and our ability to secure new project opportunities any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation such as barge rail or truck that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors likewise competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options or customers opt to construct their own facilities for services previously provided by us this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle 

from both existing and proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us if capacity on our assets remains unused our ability to recontract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired 

the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices our co 2 business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas producing properties and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines business segment depend to a large degree and certain businesses within our product pipelines business segment depend to a lesser degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices for 2020  we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately 5 million each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact dcf by approximately 1 million and each 1 change in the ratio of the weighted average ngl price per barrel to the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact dcf by approximately 2 million 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii domestic and global economic conditions iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political instability in oil producing countries vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports viii the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities and ix the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks please read “ —our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income ” 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas or a prolonged unfavorable price environment would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co 2 business segment’s proved reserves if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

in recent decades there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk ” 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle such as leaks releases the breakdown underperformance or failure of equipment facilities information systems or processes damage to our pipelines caused by thirdparty construction the compromise of information and control systems spills at terminals and hubs spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities adverse sea conditions including storms and rising sea levels and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals operator error labor disputeswork stoppages disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers operational disruptions or apportionment on thirdparty systems or refineries on which our assets depend and catastrophic events such as natural disasters fires floods explosions earthquakes acts of terrorists and saboteurs cyber security breaches and other similar events many of which are beyond our control additional risks to our vessels include capsizing grounding and navigation errors 

the occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution significant reputational damage impairment or suspension of operations fines or other regulatory penalties and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements any of which also 

could result in substantial financial losses including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater in addition the consequences of any operational incident including as a result of adverse sea conditions at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines andor the repair of marine terminals 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

unfavorable economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services in addition uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions sustained unfavorable commodity prices volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us see “—financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “—the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments” 

if economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets globally in the us or in other key markets become more volatile or deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing and some of them may be highly leveraged our counterparties are subject to their own operating market financial and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness oil ngl and natural gas prices were all lower on average in 2019 compared to 2018 and natural gas prices have continued to decline so far in 2020 further deterioration in oil prices or a continuation of the existing low natural gas or ngl price environment would likely cause severe financial distress to some of our customers with direct commodity price exposure and may result in additional customer bankruptcies further the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited by ferc regulation while certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and therefore the parent’s credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers’ ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us furthermore financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts owed to us similarly our contracts with such customers may be renegotiated at lower rates or terminated altogether significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets we evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate 

if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i the loss of key customers of the acquired business ii demands on management related to the increase in our size iii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iv difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting budgeting reporting internal controls and other systems and v difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion 

our business operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects in addition market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders potential impacts of negative public opinion or reputational issues may include delays or stoppages in expansion projects legal or regulatory actions or challenges blockades increased regulatory oversight reduced support from regulatory authorities challenges to regulatory approvals difficulty securing financing for and cost overruns affecting expansion projects and the degradation of our business generally 

reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk credit market operational insurance regulatory and legal risks among others must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry particularly other energy infrastructure providers over which we have no control in particular our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase ghg emissions and contribute to climate change negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion including with respect to the production transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally could include revenue loss reduction in customer base delays in obtaining or challenges to regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects and decreased value of our securities and our business 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2 business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas and ngl including differentials between regional markets these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil natural gas and ngl 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent thenexisting underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices therefore our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—hedging activities ” and note 14 “ risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational it systems or those of third parties may adversely affect our business results of operations or business reputation 

our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions some of the operational systems we use are owned or operated by independent thirdparty vendors the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems collecting and storing information and data processing transactions and handling other processing necessary to manage our business 

while we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our it and data systems from such attacks we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program will be effective the risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations through an act of terrorism or cyber sabotage event has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations a significant failure compromise breach or interruption in our systems which may result from problems such as malware computer viruses hacking attempts or thirdparty error or malfeasance could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues efforts by us and our vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures including malware and antivirus software and controls may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and any network and information systemsrelated events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

attacks including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage or the threat of such attacks may adversely affect our business or reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events for example in 2018 a cyberattack on a shared data network forced four us natural gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers potential targets include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems the occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss 

damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters as well as subsidence and coastal erosion and climaterelated physical risks could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion these natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport in the third quarter of 2017 hurricane harvey caused disruptions in our operations and damage to our assets near the texas gulf coast requiring approximately 45 million in repair costs approximately 10 million of which was not recoverable through insurance for more information regarding the impact of hurricane harvey on our assets and operating results see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of weather and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding these climaterelated changes could damage physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions in addition we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” 

substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the us have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders steve kean our chief executive officer and kim dang our president along with the other members of our senior management mssrs kinder and kean and ms dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean ms 

dang or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

our insurance policies do not cover all losses costs or liabilities that we may experience and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums 

our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost there is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of nonrenewal the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 334 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our whollyowned us subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will 

generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms further to the extent that financial markets characterize investments that might be impacted by public perception of or federal or state regulation related to climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk our cost of and ability to access capital may be adversely affected a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels 

our and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ evolving policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossilfuel energy companies which has resulted in certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in such companies ultimately this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 89 billion of our approximately 334 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service variablerate debt would increase as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor depending on our selection of repayment options and certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to onemonth libor or threemonth libor in july 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced a desire to phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on libor as a reference rate however we can provide no assurance that marketaccepted rates and transition methodologies will be available and finalized at the time of libor cessation if clear market standards and transition methodologies have not developed by the time libor becomes unavailable we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates under our revolving credit facility and our interest rate swap agreements if we are unable to negotiate replacement rates on favorable terms it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 

for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures if our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions our 

ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock these reflect our current judgment but as with any estimate they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report if our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions ” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders 

risks related to regulation 

the ferc or the cpuc may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc or the cpuc to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact on our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 18 “ litigation and environmental ” to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability in addition a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the current us presidential administration because it remains unclear specifically what the current administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state and local taxation ii rates which include tax reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the costs of raw materials such as steel which may be affected by tariffs or otherwise vii the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations viii acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses ix the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities x reporting and information posting requirements xi the maintenance of accounts and records and xii relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—regulation ” 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act the oil pollution act or analogous state laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could harm our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us for example the federal clean air act and other similar federal and state laws are subject to periodic review and amendment which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity at the federal and state level there are for example federal guidelines issued by the us department of transportation dot for pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climaterelated risk and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of ghgs such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report ghg emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2 for example from our mcelmo dome co 2 field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further regulate ghg emissions include establishing ghg “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our ghg emissions pay taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market those rules and regulations are largely complete although in december 2016 the cftc reproposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges thus we cannot predict how further rules and regulations will affect us 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and crewed by predominately us citizens our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens

general 

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future we have four business segments as further described below 

natural gas pipelines 

this segment owns and operates i major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems ii natural gas gathering systems and processing and treating facilities iii ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems and iv lng regasification liquefaction and storage facilities 

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under longterm fixed contracts to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 76 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2019  the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ sales portfolio was approximately seven years our lng regasification and liquefaction and associated storage contracts are subscribed under longterm agreements 

our midstream assets provide natural gas gathering and processing services these assets are mostly feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to fee based arrangements some of which may include minimum volume commitments we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

products pipelines 

this segment owns and operates refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver among other products gasoline diesel and jet fuel propane ethane crude oil and condensate to various markets this segment also owns andor operates associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have 49 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines and terminals located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index and a ferc index rate 

our crude condensate and refined petroleum products transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to i ferc and state tariffs and ii longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments and terminalling as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our pipelines and terminals are affected by the volumes of crude oil refined petroleum products and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

terminals 

this segment owns and operates i liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the us that store and handle various commodities including gasoline diesel fuel chemicals ethanol metals and petroleum coke and ii jones actqualified tankers 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipelines business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which on average is approximately three years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 

as with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are petroleum coke metals and ores in addition the majority of our contracts for this business contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated events including hurricanes may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones actqualified tankers in our terminals business segment as of december 31 2019  we have sixteen jones actqualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are primarily operating pursuant to multiyear fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

co 2   

the co 2 segment i manages the production transportation and marketing of co 2 to oil fields that use co 2 as a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields ii owns interests in and operates oil fields and gasoline processing plants in west texas and iii owns and operates a crude oil pipeline system in west texas 

the co 2 source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2019  had a remaining average contract life of approximately nine years co 2 sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2019 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2020 budget approximately 97 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 3 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2 business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2 typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2 business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add the revenues we receive from our crude oil and ngl sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 4949 per barrel in 2019 and 5783 per barrel in 2018 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 5512 per barrel in 2019 and 5863 per barrel in 2018 

also see note 15 “revenue recognition” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about the types of contracts and revenues recognized for each of our segments 

kml 

sale of us portion of cochin pipeline and kml 

on december 16 2019 we closed on two crossconditional transactions resulting in the sale of the us portion of the cochin pipeline and all the outstanding equity of kml including our 70 interest to pembina pipeline corporation pembina together the “kml and us cochin sale” we recognized a pretax net gain of 1296 million from these transactions included within “ gain loss on divestitures and impairments net ” on our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31 2019 we received cash proceeds of 1553 million  net of a working capital adjustment for the us portion of the cochin pipeline which was used to pay down debt kml common shareholders received 03068 shares of pembina common equity for each share of kml common equity for our 70 interest in kml we received approximately 25 million shares of pembina common equity with a pretax fair value on the transaction date of approximately 892 million the fair market value as of december 31 2019 of the pembina common shares was 925 million and is reported as “ marketable securities at fair value ” within our accompanying consolidated balance sheet level 1 inputs were utilized to measure the fair value of the pembina common stock the pembina common shares were subsequently sold on january 9 2020 and we received proceeds of approximately 907 million 764 million after tax which will be used to pay down debt the assets sold were part of our natural gas pipelines and terminals business segments 

sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project 

on august 31 2018 kml completed the sale of the tmpl the tmep and the puget sound pipeline system for net cash consideration of c443 billion us34 billion which is the contractual purchase price of c 45 billion net of a preliminary working capital adjustment the “tmpl sale” these assets comprised our kinder morgan canada business segment we recognized a pretax gain from the tmpl sale of 595 million within “ gain loss on divestitures and impairments net ” in our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31 2018 during the first quarter of 2019 kml settled the remaining 28 million of working capital adjustments which amount was substantially accrued for as of december 31 2018 

on january 3 2019 kml distributed the net proceeds from the tmpl sale to its shareholders as a return of capital public owners of kml’s restricted voting shares reflected as noncontrolling interests by us received approximately 09 billion c12 billion and most of our approximate 70 portion of the net proceeds of 19 billion c25 billion after canadian tax were used to repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 04 billion and in february 2019 to pay down approximately 13 billion of maturing longterm debt 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition ii income taxes iii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iv the fair values used in a calculations of possible asset and equity investment impairment charges and b calculation for the annual goodwill impairment test v reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities vi provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables vii computation of the gain or loss if any on assets sold in whole or in part and viii exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

environmental matters 

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see part i items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—narrative description of business—environmental matters ” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

legal and regulatory matters 

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities that are probable we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 18 “litigation and environmental” to our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

hedging activities 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices foreign currency exposure on eurodenominated debt and until our recent divestitures of our canadian assets net investments in foreign operations and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these derivative contracts are or were in respect to our canadian operations generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged risk and any component 

excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument by using a systematic and rational method 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2019  our pension plans were underfunded by 620 million  and our opeb plans were fully funded our pension and opeb obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and opeb plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “ sharebased compensation and employee benefits ” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and opeb can be and have been revised in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2019  we had deferred net losses of approximately  434 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and opeb plans 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and opeb plans for the year ended december 31 2019  

 

 

income taxes 

income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments including kmi’s investment in its whollyowned subsidiary kmp 

results of operations 

overview 

as described in further detail below our management evaluates our performance primarily using the gaap financial measures of segment ebda as presented in note 16 “ reportable segments ” net income and net income available to common stockholders along with the nongaap financial measures of adjusted earnings and dcf both in the aggregate and per share for each adjusted segment ebda adjusted ebitda net debt and net debt to adjusted ebitda 

for segment reporting purposes effective january 1 2019 certain assets were transferred among our business segments as a result individual segment results for the year ended december 31 2018 have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation in the following mda tables the reclassified amounts were not material 

gaap financial measures 

the consolidated earnings results for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 present segment ebda net income and net income available to common stockholders which are prepared and presented in accordance with gaap segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses and corporate charges interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses and corporate charges include such items as unallocated employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap financial measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap financial measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

certain items 

certain items as adjustments used to calculate our nongaap financial measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for 

example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses see tables included in “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income gaap to adjusted ebitda” and “—nongaap financial measures—supplemental information” below in addition certain items are described in more detail in the footnotes to tables included in “—segment earnings results” and “—general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests” below 

adjusted earnings 

adjusted earnings is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders for certain items adjusted earnings is used by us and certain external users of our financial statements to assess the earnings of our business excluding certain items as another reflection of the company’s ability to generate earnings we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted earnings is net income available to common stockholders adjusted earnings per share uses adjusted earnings and applies the same twoclass method used in arriving at basic earnings per common share see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” below 

dcf 

dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders for certain items adjusted earnings and further by dda and amortization of excess cost of equity investments income tax expense cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in common share dividends see “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf” and “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” below 

adjusted segment ebda 

adjusted segment ebda is calculated by adjusting segment ebda for certain items attributable to the segment adjusted segment ebda is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business we believe adjusted segment ebda is a a useful performance metric because it provides management and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted segment ebda is segment ebda see “—consolidated earnings results gaap—certain items affecting consolidated earnings results” for a reconciliation of segment ebda to adjusted segment ebda by business segment 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is calculated by adjusting ebitda for certain items our share of unconsolidated joint venture dda and income tax expense net of our partners’ share of consolidating joint venture dda and income tax expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests that is further adjusted for kml noncontrolling interests net of its applicable certain items adjusted ebitda is used by management and external users in conjunction with our net debt as described further below to evaluate certain leverage metrics therefore we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income see “—adjusted segment ebda to adjusted ebitda to dcf” and “—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income gaap to adjusted ebitda” below  

net debt 

net debt is a nongaap financial measure that is useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our leverage net debt is calculated by subtracting from debt i cash and cash equivalents ii the preferred interest in the general partner of kmp which was redeemed in january 2020 iii debt fair value adjustments and iv the foreign exchange impact on eurodenominated bonds for which we have entered into currency swaps we believe the most comparable 

measure to net debt is debt net of cash and cash equivalents our net debttoadjusted ebitda ratio was 43 as of december 31 2019 

consolidated earnings results gaap 

the following tables summarize the key components of our consolidated earnings results 



 

 

certain items affecting consolidated earnings results 



 

 

year ended december 31 2019 vs 2018 

income before income taxes increased 659 million in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was due primarily to greater contributions from the natural gas pipelines segment and lower interest expense partially offset by reduced contributions from the co 2 segment and the trans mountain sale in 2018 net income before income taxes for 2019 was further affected by a gain associated with the kml and us cochin sale which was partly offset by noncash impairments of our investment in ruby pipeline driven by upcoming contract expirations and competing natural gas supplies and certain gathering and processing assets in oklahoma and north texas driven by reduced drilling activity net income was further impacted by noncash impairments taken during 2018 

after giving effect to certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussions that follow the remaining increase of 16 million from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to increased performance from our natural gas pipelines business segment and decreased interest expense net partially offset by lower earnings from our co 2 business segment lower earnings from our kinder morgan canada business segment as a result of the tmpl sale and increased dda expense and general and administrative and corporate charges

general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests 



 

certain items 

 

general and administrative expenses and corporate charges adjusted for certain items increased 34 million in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to higher pension expenses of 44 million partially offset by lower expenses of 17 million due to the tmpl sale 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income adjusted for certain items decreased 75 million in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower average debt balances and greater capitalized interest partially offset by higher libor rates which impacted our interest rate swap agreements and impact of 2018 canadian operations which includes interest income on tmpl proceeds 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2019 and 2018 approximately 27 and 31 respectively of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “ risk management —interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests adjusted for certain items decreased 17 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the tmpl and kml sales 

income taxes 

  

year ended december 31 2019 versus year ended december 31 2018 

our income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 is approximately 926 million  as compared with income tax expense of 587 million for the same period of 2018  the 339 million increase in income tax expense in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to the kml and us cochin sale 

liquidity and capital resources 

general 

  

as of december 31 2019  we had 185 million of “cash and cash equivalents” a decrease of 3095 million  94  from december 31 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by a 19 billion debt repayment using the proceeds from the 2018 tmpl sale in early 2019 and 09 billion paid to noncontrolling interests by kml on january 3 2019 as a return of capital additionally as of december 31 2019 we had borrowing capacity of approximately 39 billion under our 4 billion revolving credit facility we believe our cash position remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility discussed below in “ —shortterm liquidity ” and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4748 million and 5043 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the yeartoyear decrease is discussed below in “ —cash flows—operating activities ” generally we primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures dividend payments and our growth capital expenditures we also generally expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations shortterm borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt to refinance certain of our maturing longterm debt obligations moreover as a result of our current common stock dividend policy and our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation we do not expect the need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future 

on december 16 2019 we closed on the kml and us cochin sale discussed above in “ —general—kml—sale of us portion of cochin pipeline and kml ”   we received cash proceeds of 1553 billion for the us portion of the cochin pipeline which was used to pay down debt kml common shareholders received 03068 shares of pembina common stock for each share of kml common stock on january 9 2020 we sold the approximate 25 million shares of pembina common stock that we received in the sale of kml the aftertax proceeds of approximately 764 million will be used to pay down debt 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2019  our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i cash from operations and ii our 40 billion revolving credit facility and associated commercial paper program the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program letters of credit and commercial paper borrowings reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility see note 9 “ debt —credit facility and restrictive covenants ” to our consolidated financial statements we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and as previously discussed have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2019  our 2477 million of shortterm debt consisted primarily of i 2184 million of senior notes that mature in the next twelve months ii 100 million of a preferred interest in the general partner of kmp and iii 37 million outstanding under our commercial paper program during 2019 we repaid approximately 28 billion of maturing debt with cash proceeds received from the tmpl sale and the sale of the us portion of the cochin pipeline otherwise as our debt becomes due we intend to fund our shortterm debt primarily through credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings the proceeds from the sale of the pembina common stock andor issuing new longterm debt our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2018 was  3388 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 1862 million and 1835 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 27 million  1  unfavorable change from yearend 2018 was primarily due to i a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 3095 million  substantially offset by i 925 million of marketable securities representing the pembina common stock we received from the sale of kml ii a decrease in shortterm debt of 911 million  iii a decrease in distributions payable of 876 million related to a return of capital to kml noncontrolling interests and iv a net decrease in accounts payable accrued interest and accrued taxes generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “ —longterm financing ” and “ —capital expenditures ” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings generally we anticipate refinancing maturing longterm debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings a decrease in our credit ratings could negatively impact our borrowing costs and could limit our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities 

as of december 31 2019  our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a2 prime2 and f2 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2019  



longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock with a par value of 001 per share we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our discretionary capital investments for the foreseeable future furthermore through january 2019 we had repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our class p common stock under a 2 billion share buyback program authorized by our board of directors in december 2017 that we funded through retained cash for more information on our equity buyback program and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity 

dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries have issued longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee each other’s debt see note 20 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 30883 million and 33205 million  respectively for more information regarding our debtrelated transactions in 2019  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

for additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debtrelated transactions in 2019  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “ —results of operations—nongaap financial measures—reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders gaap to adjusted earnings to dcf ” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2019  and the amount we expect to spend for 2020 to sustain our assets and grow our business are as follows in millions

dividends and stock buyback program 

kmi common stock dividends 

the table below reflects the declaration of common stock dividends of 100 per common share for 2019  



we expect to continue to return additional value to our shareholders in 2020 through our previously announced dividend increase we plan to increase our dividend to 125 per common share in 2020  a growth rate of 25 

the actual amount of common stock dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “ risk factors—the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common stock dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november 

stock buyback program 

on july 19 2017 our board of directors approved a 2 billion common share buyback program that began in december 2017 during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we repurchased approximately 01 million 15 million and 14 million  respectively of our class p shares for approximately 2 million 273 million and 250 million  respectively since december 2017 in total we have repurchased approximately 29 million of our class p shares under the program at an average price of approximately 1818 per share for approximately 525 million

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of crude oil natural gas and ngl the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil natural gas and ngl we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



we measure the risk of price changes in the derivative instrument portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values because we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value in millions 



our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil natural gas and ngl portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances including debt fair value adjustments and the preferred interest in kmp held by kmgp that was redeemed on january 15 2020 and sensitivity to interest rates in millions 



 

 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2019  including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 27 of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

libor phase out 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor depending on our selection of repayment options and certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to onemonth libor or threemonth libor in july 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced a desire to phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee consisting of large us financial institutions convened by the us federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended replacing libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index supported by shortterm treasury repurchase agreements although there have been some transactions utilizing sofr it is unknown whether this alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for libor the agreement governing our revolving credit facility includes provisions to determine a replacement rate for libor if necessary during its term which require that we and our lenders agree upon a replacement rate based on the thenprevailing market convention for similar agreements the international swaps and derivatives association is developing parameters for replacement rates that 

would apply upon cessation of libor and has indicated plans to publish a protocol to enable market participants to include the replacement rates in existing swap agreements 

we currently do not expect the transition from libor to have a material impact on us however if clear market standards and replacement methodologies have not developed as of the time libor becomes unavailable we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates under our revolving credit facility and our interest rate swap agreements if we are unable to negotiate replacement rates on favorable terms it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2019 we had a notional principal amount of 1358 million of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixedrate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

a general development of business 

  

organizational structure 

  

we are a delaware corporation and our common stock has been publicly traded since february 2011 

you should read the following in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements under gaap and the rules and regulations of the sec our accounting records are maintained in us dollars and all references to dollars in this report are to us dollars except where stated otherwise our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned andor controlled subsidiaries and all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation the address of our principal executive offices is 1001 louisiana street suite 1000 houston texas 77002 and our telephone number at this address is 713 3699000 

recent developments 

the following is a brief listing of significant developments and updates related to our major projects and other transactions additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report “capital scope” is estimated for our share of the described project which may include portions not yet completed 







 

na  not applicable 

 

financings 

on january 3 2019 kml distributed to us our approximately 70 portion of the proceeds from the tmpl sale of approximately 19 billion after canadian tax which we used to repay our outstanding balance of commercial paper borrowings and then in february 2019 to repay 500 million of maturing 900 senior notes and 800 million of maturing 265 senior notes 

in december 2018 and january 2019 we repurchased approximately 15 million and 01 million respectively of our class p shares for approximately 23 million and 2 million respectively at an average price of 1554 per share as part of our 2 billion common share buyback program approved by our board of directors in december 2017 

on november 16 2018 we entered into i a new fiveyear 40 billion revolving credit agreement and ii a new 364day 500 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and replaced the prior kmi credit agreement 

2019 outlook   

we expect to declare dividends of 100 per share for 2019 a 25 increase from the 2018 declared dividends of 080 per share and generate approximately 50 billion of dcf in 2019 we also expect to invest 31 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2019 our discretionary spending will be primarily funded with excess internally generated cash flow with no need to access equity markets during 2019 

we are unable to provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf due to the impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—nongaap financial measures ” 

our expectations for 2019 assume average annual prices for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas of 6000 per barrel and 315 per mmbtu respectively consistent with forward pricing during our 2019 budget process the vast majority of revenue we generate is supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co 2  segment in which we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil and ngl production to minimize this sensitivity for 2019 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel from our budget of 6000 per barrel would impact our budgeted dcf by approximately 8 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas from our budget of 315 per mmbtu would impact budgeted dcf by approximately 1 million 

in addition our expectations for 2019 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and 

because of these uncertainties it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “ risk factors ” below for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2019 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

b financial information about segments 

for financial information on our reportable business segments see note 17 “ reportable segments ” to our consolidated financial statements 

c narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

 

it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances however as discussed under item 1a “risk factors”  below there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 

we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and full and partial divestitures and we are currently contemplating potential transactions any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions and as applicable receipt of fairness opinions and approval of our board of directors while there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations 

business segments 

our business segments and their primary activities and sources of revenues are as follows 

 

natural gas pipelines 

our natural gas pipelines business segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our lng terminals and includes both ferc regulated and nonferc regulated assets 

our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas transportation storage sales gathering processing and treating and various lng services within this segment are i approximately 46000 miles of wholly owned natural gas pipelines and ii our equity interests in entities that have approximately 26000 miles of natural gas pipelines along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western us louisiana texas the midwest northeast rocky mountain midwest and southeastern regions our lng terminals also serve natural gas market areas in the southeast the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines business segment assets as of december 31 2018  the design capacity represents transmission gathering or liquefaction capacity depending on the nature of the asset 





 



 

competition 

the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines and their shippers for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service from time to time other projects are proposed that would compete with us we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including electricity coal propane fuel oils and renewables such as wind and solar several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

products pipelines 

 our products pipelines business segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate and ngl pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes our significant products pipelines business segment assets we own and operate as of december 31 2018  



 



 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products and railcars our products pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

terminals 

our terminals business segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product crude oil chemical ethanol and other liquid terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines business segment and all of our petroleum coke metal and ores facilities our terminals are located throughout the us and in portions of canada we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition terminals’ marine operations include jones actqualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined petroleum products between us ports the following summarizes our terminals business segment assets as of december 31 2018  



 

 

competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in north america based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil chemical pipeline and refining companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services in some locations competitors are smaller independent operators with lower cost structures our jones actqualified product tankers compete with other jones act qualified vessel fleets 

co 2   

our co 2  business segment produces transports and markets co 2  for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2  pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co 2  supply and transportation services to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

sales and transportation activities 

our principal market for co 2  is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin our ownership of co 2  resources as of december 31 2018 includes 



 

 

co 2  business segment pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2  pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2  for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years the tariffs charged on i the wink crude oil pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission ii the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline are regulated by the texas railroad commission and iii the cortez pipeline are based on a consent decree our other co 2 pipelines are not regulated 

our ownership of co 2  and crude oil pipelines as of december 31 2018 includes 



 

 

oil and gas producing activities 

oil producing interests 

our ownership interests in oilproducing fields located in the permian basin of west texas include the following 



our oil and gas producing activities are not significant and therefore we do not include the supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities under accounting standards codification topic 932 extractive activities  oil and gas 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2  include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2  resources our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other co 2  pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2  to the denver city texas market area 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations includes the operations of kinder morgan tejas pipeline llc kinder morgan border pipeline llc kinder morgan texas pipeline llc kinder morgan north texas pipeline llc and the miermonterrey mexico pipeline system buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2  business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2  business segments in 2018 2017 and 2016 accounted for 23 22 and 19 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 18 “litigation environmental and other contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a petroleum products or crude oil pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our condensate cochin pipeline system is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

as an owner and operator of natural gas companies subject to the natural gas act of 1938 we are required to provide service to shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities at regulated rates that have been determined by the ferc to be just and reasonable recourse rates and general terms and conditions for service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the ferc for each pipeline including storage facilities or companies as used herein generally recourse rates are based on our cost of service including recovery of and a return on our investment posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without ferc authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement the ferc can initiate proceedings on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates upon mutual agreement the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates that are not bound by and are irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreedupon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates the actual negotiated rate agreement or a summary of such agreement must be posted as part of the pipelines’ tariffs while pipelines and their shippers may agree to a variety of negotiated rate structures depending on the shipper and circumstance pipelines 

generally must use for all shippers the form of service agreement that is contained within their fercapproved tariff any deviation from the pro forma  service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations in the terms and conditions of service are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc as is more fully described in note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission of mexico the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitation i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  national agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations issued by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to continue the safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or “pipes act of 2016” requires phmsa among other regulators to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to set more stringent standards for intrastate pipelines in compliance with the pipes act of 2016 we have implemented procedures for underground natural gas storage facilities 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the future in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines or facilities may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are fulfilling the osha 

requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state provincial and local regulation 

certain of our activities are subject to various state or provincial and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may result in claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution thirdparty claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and crewed by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreignflagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the us secretary of transportation upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state or provincial laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating 

restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 271 million  as of december 31 2018 our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately 271 million   to approximately 448 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian federal and provincial statutes from time to time the epa as well as other us federal and state regulators and canadian federal and provincial regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations or wastes from oil and gas facilities that are currently exempt as exploration and production waste may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance” by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of ghg emissions from stationary sources for further information see  “—climate change”  below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act the epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 the epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggered a process under which the epa designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the new naaqs standard now certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the new naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newlyinstalled equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as ghgs may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of ghgs various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such ghgs including the epa programs to report ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain ghgs including co 2  and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with ghg emissions reporting and permitting requirements 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co 2  emission performance rates for power generating units that are fueled by coal oil or natural gas the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved in october 2017 the epa proposed to repeal the clean power plan in august 2018 the epa proposed to replace the clean power plan and affordable clean energy rule the ultimate determination of the clean power plan and affordable clean energy rule remains uncertain while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan or the affordable clean energy rule it remains unclear what effect a final rule if it comes into force might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional ghg “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for ghgs that go beyond the requirements of the epa some of the states have implemented regulations that require additional monitoring and reporting of methane emissions depending on the state programs pending implementation we could be required to conduct additional monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of ghgs primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the ghg emissions pay taxes related to the ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions however the timing severity and location of these climate change impacts are not known with certainty and these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over varying time horizons 

because natural gas produces less ghg emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the clean power plan or affordable clean energy rule could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that ghg regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2  business segment however these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts ghg regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined riskbased performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees   

we employed 11012 fulltime personnel at december 31 2018  including approximately 936 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2019 and 2022 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land generally under agreements that are perpetual or provide for renewal rights substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits 

have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased by the company

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities depend in part on continued production of natural gas oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for natural gas oil ngl refined petroleum products co 2  coal steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand for example without additions to oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may reduce or shut down production during times of lower product prices or higher production costs to the extent they become uneconomic producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions or higher development or production costs could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets in addition changes in the overall demand for hydrocarbons the regulatory environment or applicable governmental policies including in relation to climate change or other environmental concerns may have a negative impact on the supply of crude oil and other products in recent years a number of initiatives and regulatory changes relating to reducing ghg emissions have been undertaken by federal provincial state and municipal governments and oil and gas industry participants   in addition emerging technologies and public opinion have resulted in increasing demand for energy efficiency including energy provided from renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels and fuelefficient alternatives such as hybrid and electric vehicles these factors could result in not only increased costs for producers of hydrocarbons but also an overall decrease in the demand for hydrocarbons each of the foregoing could negatively impact our business directly as well as our shippers and other customers which in turn could negatively impact our prospects for new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts or the ability of our customers and shippers to honor their contractual commitments see “— financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products   or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” below 

we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for the products we handle in addition irrespective of supply of or demand for products we handle implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on us see “— the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us ” 

expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining or our inability to obtain permits and rightsofway as well as public opposition increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns inclement weather and other delays should we pursue expansion of or construction of new projects through joint ventures with others we will share control and benefits from those projects 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets new growth projects generally will be subject to among other things the receipt of regulatory approvals feasibility and cost analyses funding availability and industry market and demand conditions if we pursue joint ventures with third parties those parties may share approval rights over major decisions and may act in their own interests their views may differ from our own or our views of the interests of the venture which could result in operational delays or impasses which in turn could affect the financial expectations of and our benefits from the venture a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals have caused and may continue to cause delays in or cancellations of our construction projects regulatory authorities may modify their permitting policies in ways that disadvantage our construction projects such as the ferc’s consideration of changes to its certificate policy statement such factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects see “— we are subject to reputational risks and risks related to public opinion ” for example changing public attitudes toward pipelines bearing fossil fuels may impede our ability to secure rights of way or governmental reviews and authorizations on a timely basis or at all inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant increases in costs of construction materials cost overruns or delays or our inability to obtain a required permit or rightofway could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

we face competition from other pipelines and terminals as well as other forms of transportation and storage 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation such as barge rail or truck that delivers the products we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors likewise competing terminals or other storage options may become more attractive to our customers to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve more desirable transportation or storage options this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us if capacity on our assets remains unused our ability to recontract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers could be impaired 

the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices our co 2  business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas producing properties and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines business segment depend to a large degree and certain businesses within our product pipelines business segment depend to a lesser degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices for 2019 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately 8 million each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact dcf by approximately 1 million and each 1 change in the ratio of the weightedaverage ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel would impact dcf by approximately 3 million 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii domestic and global economic conditions iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental 

regulation v political instability in oil producing countries vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports viii the proximity and availability of storage and transportation infrastructure and processing and treating facilities and ix the availability and prices of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks please read “ —our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income ” 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas or a prolonged unfavorable price environment would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co 2  business segment’s proved reserves if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

in recent decades there have been periods worldwide of both overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the cycles of excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas have placed pressures on prices and resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk ” 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to the transportation and storage of the products we handle such as leaks releases the breakdown underperformance or failure of equipment facilities information systems or processes damage to our pipelines caused by thirdparty construction the compromise of information and control systems spills at terminals and hubs spills associated with the loading and unloading of harmful substances at rail facilities adverse sea conditions including storms and rising sea levels and releases or spills from our shipping vessels or vessels loaded at our marine terminals operator error labor disputeswork stoppages disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers operational disruptions or apportionment on thirdparty systems or refineries on which our assets depend and catastrophic events such as natural disasters fires floods explosions earthquakes acts of terrorists and saboteurs cyber security breaches and other similar events many of which are beyond our control additional risks to our vessels include capsizing grounding and navigation errors 

the occurrence of any of these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution significant reputational damage impairment or suspension of operations fines or other regulatory penalties and revocation of regulatory approvals or imposition of new requirements any of which also could result in substantial financial losses including lost revenue and cash flow to the extent that an incident causes an interruption of service for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater in addition the consequences of any operational incident including as a result of adverse sea conditions at one of our marine terminals may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing leaks and releases occurring in the ocean or along coastlines andor the repair of marine terminals 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

unfavorable economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry the coal industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services in addition uncertain or changing economic conditions within one or more geographic regions may affect our operating results within the affected regions volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us see  “—financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “—the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments” 

if economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets globally in the us or in other key markets become more volatile or deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers many of our counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations or debt or equity financing and some of them may be highly leveraged our counterparties are subject to their own operating market financial and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness for example pge a customer of ruby filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in january 2019 see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general—investment in ruby ” further the security that is permitted to be obtained from such customers may be limited by ferc regulation while certain of our customers are subsidiaries of an entity that has an investment grade credit rating in many cases the parent entity has not guaranteed the obligations of the subsidiary and therefore the parent’s credit ratings may have no bearing on such customers’ ability to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us furthermore financially distressed customers might be forced to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we cannot provide any assurance that such customers and key counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed customers or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if one of such customers or counterparties files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts owed to us significant customer and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties completing acquisitions or integrating new businesses and properties and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets we evaluate and pursue assets and businesses that we believe will complement or expand our operations in accordance with our growth strategy we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete acquisitions in the future or achieve the desired results from any acquisitions we do complete any acquired business or assets will be subject to many of the same risks as our existing businesses and may not achieve the levels of performance that we anticipate 

if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i the loss of key customers of the acquired business ii demands on management related to the increase in our size iii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iv difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting budgeting reporting internal controls and other systems and v difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion 

our business operations or financial condition generally may be negatively impacted as a result of negative public opinion public opinion may be influenced by negative portrayals of the industry in which we operate as well as opposition to development projects in addition market events specific to us could result in the deterioration of our reputation with key stakeholders potential impacts of negative public opinion or reputational issues may include delays or stoppages in expansion projects legal or regulatory actions or challenges blockades increased regulatory oversight reduced support from regulatory 

authorities challenges to regulatory approvals difficulty securing financing for and cost overruns affecting expansion projects and the degradation of our business generally 

reputational risk cannot be managed in isolation from other forms of risk credit market operational insurance regulatory and legal risks among others must all be managed effectively to safeguard our reputation our reputation and public opinion could also be impacted by the actions and activities of other companies operating in the energy industry particularly other energy infrastructure providers over which we have no control in particular our reputation could be impacted by negative publicity related to pipeline incidents or unpopular expansion projects and due to opposition to development of hydrocarbons and energy infrastructure particularly projects involving resources that are considered to increase ghg emissions and contribute to climate change negative impacts from a compromised reputation or changes in public opinion including with respect to the production transportation and use of hydrocarbons generally could include revenue loss reduction in customer base delays in obtaining or challenges to regulatory approvals with respect to growth projects and decreased value of our securities and our business 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2  business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas and ngl these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for crude oil and natural gas 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity price or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices therefore our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter 

into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—hedging activities ” and note 14 “ risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational it systems or those of third parties may adversely affect our business results of operations or business reputation 

our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions the various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems collecting and storing information and data processing transactions and handling other processing necessary to manage our business 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations a significant failure compromise breach or interruption in our systems could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues efforts by us and our vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and any network and information systemsrelated events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

attacks including acts of terrorism or cyber sabotage or the threat of such attacks may adversely affect our business or reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events for example in 2018 a cyberattack on a shared data network forced four us natural gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers potential targets include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems the occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or could harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters as well as subsidence and coastal erosion could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes flooding and other natural disasters or could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion these natural disasters and phenomena could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport in the third quarter of 2017 hurricane harvey caused disruptions in our operations and damage to our assets near the texas gulf coast requiring approximately 45 million in repair costs approximately 10 million of which was not recoverable through insurance for more information regarding the impact of hurricane harvey on our assets and operating results see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of weather and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding these climaterelated changes could damage physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions in addition we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather natural disasters and phenomena can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters ” 

substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located is owned by third parties if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the us have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and a substantial increase in our costs 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

the increased financial reporting and other obligations of management resulting from kml’s obligations as a public company may divert management’s attention away from other business operations 

kml in which we own an approximate 70 interest completed its ipo in canada in may of 2017 and in 2018 completed the sale of its interest in the tmpl as described under item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general—kml—sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project ” certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of kml and we provide financial reporting support and other services as requested by kml and its controlled affiliates pursuant to a services agreement the increased obligations associated with providing support to kml as a public company may divert our management’s attention from other business concerns and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to financial reporting and other obligations that place significant demands on our management administrative operational legal internal audit and accounting resources the demands on our personnel related to kml’s obligations as a public company will be intensified as a result of the management and personnel departures and related transition following the sale of our interest in the tmpl 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders steve kean our chief executive officer and kim dang our president along with the other members of our senior management mssrs kinder and kean and ms dang have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean ms dang or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

our terminals business segment is subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations as a result of operations in canada 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of our terminals business segment in canada a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues cash flows and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

our insurance policies do not cover all losses costs or liabilities that we may experience and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums 

our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets if significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost there is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms if at all or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of nonrenewal the unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 366 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee agreement could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn reduce our cash flows and limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2018 approximately 114 billion of our approximately 366 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service variablerate debt would increase as would our costs to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures if our internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to fund one or more capital projects or acquisitions we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

our and our customer’s access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels 

our and our customer’s access to capital could be affected by evolving financial institutions’ policies concerning businesses linked to fossil fuels public opinion toward industries linked to fossil fuels continues to evolve concerns about the potential effects of climate change have caused some to direct their attention towards sources of funding for fossilfuel energy companies which has resulted in certain financial institutions funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energyrelated activities ultimately this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities and consequently could both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock these reflect our current judgment but as with any estimate they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “ information regarding forwardlooking statements ” at the beginning of this report if our board of directors elects to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions ” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further those stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders 

risks related to regulation 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact on our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines in addition following the 2017 tax reform which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 the ferc initiated the form 501g process to review the estimated impact of the 2017 tax reform on interstate pipelines with respect to tax recovery in existing jurisdictional rates see note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies—ferc proceedings ” to our consolidated financial statements any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state provincial and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability in addition a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the current us presidential administration because it remains unclear specifically what the current administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state provincial and local taxation ii rates which include tax reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the costs of raw materials such as steel which may be affected by tariffs or otherwise vii the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations viii the acquisition of other businesses ix the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services 

or facilities x reporting and information posting requirements xi the maintenance of accounts and records and xii relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations such as the 2017 tax reform and the resulting form 501g process initiated by ferc applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—c narrative description of business—regulation ” 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act the oil pollution act or analogous state or provincial laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations including required permits and other approvals also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could harm our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us for example the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws are subject to periodic review and amendment which could result in more stringent emission control requirements obligating us to make significant capital expenditures at our facilities   there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2   “ business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity at the federal state and provincial level there are for example federal guidelines issued by the us department of transportation dot for pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climate change and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of ghgs such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control ghg emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report ghg emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2  for example from our mcelmo dome co 2  field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further regulate ghg emissions include establishing ghg “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our ghg emissions pay taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to ghgs or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather these climaterelated changes could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone and rainsusceptible regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized 

injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market those rules and regulations are largely complete although in december 2016 the cftc reproposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges thus we cannot predict how further rules and regulations will affect us 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and crewed by predominately us citizens our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens

general 

  

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

   

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us and canadian energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 76 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2018  the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ sales portfolio was approximately   six years 

our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil these assets are mostly feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to fee based arrangements some of which may include minimum volume commitments we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business generally is driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have approximately 55 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being 

shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to i longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or ii through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude oil and condensate pipelines are affected by the volumes of crude oil and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between liquid and bulk terminals and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipelines business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts   which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time as with our refined petroleum products pipelines transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are petroleum coke metals and ores for the most part we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes and other weather related events may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones act tankers in our terminals business segment as of december 31 2018 we have sixteen jones act qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are currently operating pursuant to multiyear fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

the co 2  source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2018 had a remaining average contract life of approximately nine years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2019 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2019 budget approximately 97 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 3 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2  business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2  business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil and ngl sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 5783 per barrel in 2018 5840 per barrel in 2017 and 6152 per barrel in 2016 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 5863 per barrel in 2018 4961 per barrel in 2017 and 4136 per barrel in 2016

investment  in ruby 

in january 2019 pacific gas and electric pge filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection our exposure to pge is limited to our 750 million equity investment in ruby and an approximate 55 million note receivable from ruby where pge is ruby’s largest customer pge represents approximately 93 million of annual revenues on ruby and our partner’s preferred equity interest in ruby is senior to our interest despite the bankruptcy filing ruby continues to perform under its existing service contracts with pge and pge has provided credit support on its trade payables to ruby through a prepayment arrangement while the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings remains uncertain there is the potential for ruby’s existing contracts with pge to be canceled in the bankruptcy process any cancellation of these contracts could negatively impact ruby’s future revenues and require us to evaluate our investment in ruby for an other than temporary impairment this could result in a material impairment of our investment in ruby at the time such events become known 

  

kml 

sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project 

on august 31 2018 kml completed the sale of the tmpl the tmep the puget sound pipeline system and kinder morgan canada inc the canadian employer of our staff that operate the business which were indirectly acquired by the government of canada through trans mountain corporation a subsidiary of the canada development investment corporation for cash consideration of c443 billion  us34 billion which is the contractual purchase price of c 45 billion  net of a preliminary working capital adjustment the “tmpl sale” these assets comprised our kinder morgan canada business segment we recognized a pretax gain from the tmpl sale of 596 million  within “loss on impairments and divestitures net” in our accompanying consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31 2018 including an incremental working capital adjustment of 26 million  accrued as of december 31 2018 

on january 3 2019 pursuant to kml’s shareholders’ approval on november 29 2018 kml distributed to its shareholders as a return of capital the net proceeds from the tmpl sale after capital gains taxes customary purchase price adjustments and the repayment of debt outstanding under a temporary kml credit facility see note 9 “ debt—credit facilities and restrictive covenants—kml ” kml’s public owners of its restricted voting shares reflected as noncontrolling interests by us received approximately 09 billion c12 billion and part of our approximate 70 portion of the net proceeds of 19 billion c25 billion after canadian tax were used to immediately repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 04 billion and in february 2019 to pay down approximately 13 billion of maturing longterm debt to facilitate the return of capital and provide flexibility for kml’s dividends going forward kml’s shareholders also approved a reduction in the stated capital of its restricted voting shares by c145 billion which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 along with a “reverse stock split” of kml’s restricted voting shares and kml’s special voting shares that we own on a one for three  basis three shares consolidating to one share which occurred on january 4 2019 

kml continues to manage a portfolio of strategic infrastructure assets across western canada including i the crude terminal facilities which constitute the largest merchant terminal storage position in the edmonton market and the largest origination crude by rail loading facility in north america ii the vancouver wharves terminal the largest mineral concentrate exportimport facility on the west coast of north america iii the jet fuel pipeline system and iv the canadian portion of the us and canadian cochin pipeline system these kml assets are part of our products pipelines and terminals business segments 

kml ipo 

the interest in the canadian business operations that we sold to the public on may 30 2017 in kml’s ipo represented an interest in all our operating assets in our kinder morgan canada business segment and our operating canadian assets in our terminals and products pipelines business segments these canadian assets included the tmpl tmep and the puget sound pipeline system all of which have been sold in the tmpl sale the jet fuel pipeline system the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline system the vancouver wharves terminal and the north 40 terminal as well as three jointly controlled investments the edmonton rail terminal the alberta crude terminal and the base line terminal 

subsequent to the ipo we retained control of kml and as a result it remains consolidated in our consolidated financial statements the public ownership of the kml restricted voting shares is reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our 

consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated balance sheets earnings attributable to the public ownership of kml are presented in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented after may 30 2017 kml transacts in andor uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency which affects our segment results due to the variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates 

 subsequent to its ipo kml has obtained a credit facility and completed two preferred share offerings kml continues to be a selffunding entity and we do not anticipate making contributions to fund its growth or operations 

2017 tax reform 

while the 2017 tax reform will ultimately be moderately positive for us the reduced corporate income tax rate caused certain of our deferredtax assets to be revalued at 21 versus 35 at the end of 2017 although there is no impact to the underlying related deductions which can continue to be used to offset future taxable income we took an estimated approximately 14 billion noncash accounting charge in 2017 the positive impacts of the law include the reduced corporate income tax rate and the fact that several of our us business units essentially all but our interstate natural gas pipelines will be able to deduct 100 of their capital expenditures through 2022 see note 5 “ income taxes ” to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition ii income taxes iii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iv the fair values used to a assign purchase price from business combinations b determine possible asset and equity investment impairment charges and c calculate the annual goodwill impairment test v reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities vi provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables vii computing the gain or loss if any on assets sold in whole or in part and viii exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see 

part i items 1 and 2 “ business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters ” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal and regulatory matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 18 “ litigation environmental and other contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

hedging activities 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices foreign currency exposure on euro denominated debt and net investments in foreign operations and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14   “ risk management ”   to our consolidated financial statements 

  

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2018  our pension plans were underfunded by   702 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by   33 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the 

determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2018  we had deferred net losses of approximately  536 million  in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2018  

 

 

income taxes 

  

income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments including kmi’s investment in its whollyowned subsidiary kmp 

results of operations 

overview 

our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of segment ebda and as discussed below under “—nongaap financial measures”  dcf and segment ebda before certain items segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses include such items as unallocated employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to dispositions and acquisitions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

effective january 1 2019 certain assets were transferred between natural gas pipelines products pipelines and terminals business segments which are not reflected in the following business segment management discussion and analysis tables below 

consolidated earnings results 



 

 certain items affecting total segment ebda see “ —nongaap measures ” below  



 

year ended december 31 2018 vs 2017 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes c through e to the table above accounted for 41 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2018 as compared to 2017 representing the difference between decreases of 319 million and 360 million from certain items in income before income taxes for 2018 and 2017 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows the remaining increase of 304 million 12 from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to increased performance from our natural gas pipelines products pipelines and co 2  business segments and decreased general and administrative expense partially offset by increased dda expense interest expense net and lower earnings from our kinder morgan canada business segment as a result of the tmpl sale and our terminals business segment 

year ended december 31 2017 vs 2016 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes c through e to the table above accounted for 555 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016 representing the difference between decreases of 360 million and 915 million from certain items in income before income taxes for 2017 and 2016 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows the remaining decrease of 32 million 1 from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to decreased performance from our natural gas pipelines business segment largely associated with our sale of a 50 interest in sng to the southern company southern company on september 1 2016 and increased dda expense partially offset by decreased general and administrative expense and decreased interest expense 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap performance measures are dcf both in the aggregate and per share and segment ebda before certain items certain items as used to calculate our nongaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses 

our nongaap performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of dcf and segment ebda before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

dcf 

  

dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dda total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of dcf to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below dcf per common share is dcf divided by average outstanding common shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends 

reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to dcf 



 

 

segment ebda before certain items 

        segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses generally are not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional 

insight into the ability of our business segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment ebda 

in the tables for each of our business segments under “— segment earnings results”  below segment ebda before certain items and revenues before certain items are calculated by adjusting the segment ebda and revenues for the applicable certain item amounts which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables revenues before certain items is provided to further enhance our analysis of segment ebda before certain items and is not a performance measure

kinder morgan canada 



 

certain items affecting segment ebda 

 other 

 

for the comparable years of 2018 and 2017 the kinder morgan canada business segment had a decrease in segment ebda of 62 million 33 primarily due to the tmpl sale on august 31 2018 sale as a result of the tmpl sale on august 31 2018 this business segment does not have results of operations on a prospective basis 

for the comparable years of 2017 and 2016 the kinder morgan canada business segment had an increase in segment ebda of 5 million 3 and an increase in revenues of 3 million 1 primarily due to i higher capitalized equity financing costs due to spending on the tmep ii currency translation gains due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and iii higher incentive revenues partly offset by lower state of washington volumes and operating expense timing changes 

general and administrative and corporate charges interest net and noncontrolling interests 



 

certain items 

 

general and administrative expenses and corporate charges before certain items decreased 81 million in 2018 and 20 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year the decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher capitalized costs of 54 million driven by the 2018 construction of elba liquefaction gulf coast and hiland facilities offset by lower spending on tgp lower vacation and labor accruals of 18 million and 7 million from the sale of tmpl the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily driven by the sale of a 50 interest in our sng natural gas pipeline system effective september 1 2016 higher capitalized costs lower state franchise taxes legal and insurance costs partially offset by higher labor accruals and pension costs 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income before certain items increased 20 million in 2018 and decreased 128 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year the increase in interest expense in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher shortterm interest rates and higher shortterm debt balance partially offset by lower average longterm debt balance the decrease in interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances as proceeds from the may 2017 kml ipo and our september 2016 sale of a 50 interest in sng were used to pay down debt partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2018  and 2017 approximately 31 and 28 respectively of the principal amount of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “ risk management—interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items increased 30 million in 2018 and 19 million in 2017 when compared with the respective prior year the increases were primarily due to the may 30 2017 sale of approximately 30 of our canadian business operations to the public in the kml ipo 

income taxes 

  

year ended december 31 2018 versus year ended december 31 2017 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018 is approximately 587 million as compared with 2017 tax expense of 1938 million the 1351 million decrease in tax expense is primarily due to i the decrease in the federal income tax rate as a result of the 2017 tax reform and ii the decrease in uncertain tax positions as a result of audit settlements partially offset by i the tax impact on the tmpl sale and ii the decrease of enhanced oil recovery credits 

year ended december 31 2017 versus year ended december 31 2016 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 is approximately 1938 million as compared with 2016 tax expense of 917 million the 1021 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to i an increase in yearoveryear earnings as a result of fewer asset impairments and project writeoffs in 2017 and ii higher tax expense as a result of the 2017 tax reform these increases are partially offset by i the 2016 impact of our regulated natural gas pipelines business segment’s 817 million nontaxdeductible goodwill as a result of the sale of a 50 interest in sng and ii the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2018  we had 3280 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” an increase of 3016 million   1142  from december 31 2017  we believe our cash position remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility discussed below in “ —shortterm liquidity ” and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 5043 million  and 4601 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “ —cash flows—operating activities ” generally we primarily rely on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures dividend payments and our growth capital expenditures we also generally expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations shortterm borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt to refinance certain of our maturing longterm debt obligations moreover as a result of our current common stock dividend policy and our continued focus on disciplined capital allocation we do not expect the need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future 

additionally during 2018 the tmpl sale mentioned above in “— general—kml—sale of trans mountain pipeline system and its expansion project ” was a source of liquidity and the primary driver of cash on hand as of december 31 2018 

on january 3 2019 pursuant to kml’s shareholders’ approval on november 29 2018 kml distributed to its shareholders as a return of capital the net proceeds from the tmpl sale after capital gains taxes customary purchase price adjustments and the repayment of debt outstanding under a temporary kml credit facility see “ —kml 2018 credit facility ” following kml’s public owners of its restricted voting shares reflected as noncontrolling interests by us received approximately 09 billion c12 billion and part of our approximately 70 portion of the net proceeds of 19 billion c25 billion after canadian tax were used to immediately repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings of 04 million and in february 2019 to pay down approximately 13 billion of maturing longterm debt to facilitate the return of capital and provide flexibility for kml’s dividends going forward kml’s shareholders also approved a reduction in the stated capital of its restricted voting shares by c145 billion along with a “reverse stock split” of kml’s restricted voting shares and kml’s special voting shares that we own on a one for three  basis three shares consolidating to one share which occurred on january 4 2019 

kml 2018 credit facility 

upon the closing of the tmpl sale on august 31 2018 kml established a 4year c500 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “kml 2018 credit facility” for working capital purposes replacing a temporary credit facility that was put in place following the announcement of the tmpl sale on may 30 2018 the “kml temporary credit facility” the c133 million us102 million of outstanding borrowings under the kml temporary credit facility were paid off prior to its termination with a portion of the proceeds from the tmpl sale as of december 31 2018 there were no outstanding borrowings under the kml 2018 credit facility 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings generally we anticipate refinancing maturing long term debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

as of december 31 2018  our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a3 upgraded to a2 on january 7 2019 prime2 and f3 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively we are on a positive outlook for an upgrade by fitch ratings inc 

 the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2018  



  

 

 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2018  our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i our 45 billion  revolving credit facilities and associated 40 billion  commercial paper program ii the kml 2018 credit facility for the purposes described above and iii cash from operations the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under ours and kml’s respective credit facilities we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility see note 9 “ debt—credit facilities and restrictive covenants—kmi ” to our consolidated financial statements and as previously discussed we have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2018  our 3388 million  of shortterm debt consisted primarily of i  433 million  outstanding under our 40 billion  commercial paper program and ii 2800 million  of senior notes that mature in the next year as previously discussed we repaid 17 billion of this shortterm debt in 2019 from a portion of the tmpl sale proceeds we intend to refinance our remaining shortterm debt through credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt or paying down shortterm debt using cash retained from operations our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2017  was 2828 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 1835 million  and 3466 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 1631 million   47  favorable change from yearend 2017  was primarily due to i the 2998 million of proceeds from the tmpl sale net of cash disposed partially offset by i the 890 million c1195 million distribution paid to our noncontrolling interests associated with kml on january 3 2019 876 million was the accrued us value as of december 31 2018 and a 516 million increase in current maturities of our senior notes generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “ —longterm financing ” and “ —capital expenditures ” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock with a par value of 001 per share we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future furthermore through january 2019 we have repurchased approximately 29 million shares of our class p common stock under a 2 billion  share buyback program authorized by our board of directors in december 2017 that we funded through retained cash for more information on our equity buyback program and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “ stockholders’ equity ” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries have issued longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee the debt of each other see note 20 “ guarantee of securities of subsidiaries ” to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 33205 million  and 34088 million  respectively for more information regarding our debtrelated transactions in 2018  see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

for additional information about our outstanding senior notes and debtrelated transactions in 2018  and early 2019 see note 9 “ debt ” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “ —results of operations—dcf ” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are see “ —common dividends” and “—preferred dividends ” 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2018  and the amount we expect to spend for 2019 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

the actual amount of common stock dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “ risk factors—the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common stock dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we use include exchangetraded and otc commodity financial instruments including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

we measure the risk of price changes in the crude oil natural gas and ngl derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values a hypothetical 10 movement in the 

underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value in millions 



 as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil natural gas and ngl portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances including debt fair value adjustments and the preferred interest in kmgp and sensitivity to interest rates in millions 



 

 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are 

entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2018  including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 31  of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “ risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2018 we had a notional principal amount of 1358 million  of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixedrate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt 

as of december 31 2018 we had a notional principal amount of c2450 million us1888 million of crosscurrency swap agreements that result in our selling fixed c and receiving fixed us these swaps effectively hedged the foreign currency risk associated with a substantial portion of our share of the tmpl sale proceeds that kml distributed to us on january 3 2019 at which time the crosscurrency currency swaps also expired

organizational structure 

  

we are a delaware corporation and our common stock has been publicly traded since february 2011 

sale of approximate 30 interest in our canadian business 

on may 30 2017 our indirectly owned subsidiary kml completed an ipo of 102942000 restricted voting shares listed on the toronto stock exchange tsx at a price to the public of c1700 per restricted voting share for total gross proceeds of approximately c1750 million the net proceeds of c1677 million us1245 million from the ipo were used by kml to indirectly acquire from us an approximate 30 interest in a limited partnership that holds our canadian business while we retained the remaining 70 interest we used the proceeds from kml to pay down debt 

subsequent to the ipo we retained control of kml and the limited partnership and as a result they remain consolidated in our consolidated financial statements the public ownership of the kml restricted voting shares is reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated balance sheets earnings attributable to the public ownership of kml are presented in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented after may 30 2017

kmi financings 

on august 10 2017 we issued 1 billion of unsecured senior notes with a fixed rate of 315 and 250 million of unsecured senior notes with a floating rate both due january 2023 the net proceeds from the notes were primarily used to repay all of the 225 million principal amount outstanding of hiland’s 550 senior notes due 2022 plus accrued interest and to repay the 1 billion term loan facility due 2019 

kml financings 

in addition to proceeds received from kml’s ipo discussed above on june 16 2017 kml entered into a definitive credit agreement establishing i a c40 billion revolving construction facility for the purposes of funding the development construction and completion of the tmep ii a c10 billion revolving contingent credit facility for the purpose of funding if necessary additional tmep costs and subject to the need to fund such additional costs and regulatory approval meeting the canadian nebmandated liquidity requirements and iii a c500 million revolving working capital facility to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes collectively the “kml credit facility” the kml credit facility has a five year term and is with a syndicate of financial institutions with royal bank of canada as the administrative agent on january 23 2018 kml entered into an agreement amending certain terms of the kml credit facility to among other things provide additional funding certainty with respect to the construction contingent and working capital facilities as of december 31 2017 kml had no amounts outstanding under the kml credit facility and c53 million us42 million in letters of credit 

on august 15 2017 kml completed an offering of 12000000 cumulative redeemable minimum rate reset preferred shares series 1 series 1 preferred shares on the tsx at a price to the public of 2500 per series 1 preferred share for total net proceeds of c293 million us230 million and on december 8 2017 kml completed an offering of 10000000 cumulative redeemable minimum rate reset preferred shares series 3 series 3 preferred shares on the tsx at a price to the public of 2500 per series 3 preferred share for total net proceeds of c243 million us189 million 

2018 outlook 

we expect to declare dividends of 080 per share for 2018 a 60 increase from the 2017 declared dividends of 050 per share and generate approximately 457 billion of dcf we also expect to invest 22 billion on expansion projects and other discretionary spending in 2018 excluding growth capital and discretionary spending by kml which we expect to continue to be a selffunding entity as in recent years our discretionary spending will be funded with excess internally generated cash flow with no need to access equity markets during 2018 in addition our board of directors authorized a 2 billion share buyback program and in december 2017 and january 2018 we bought back 27 million class p shares for 500 million 

we are unable to provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to dcf due to the inherent difficulty and impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as ineffectiveness on commodity interest rate and foreign currency hedges unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities 

these expectations assume average annual prices for wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas of 5650 per barrel and 300 per mmbtu respectively consistent with forward pricing during our 2018 budget process the vast majority of cash we generate is supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity 

prices the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co 2  segment in which we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil and ngl production to minimize this sensitivity for 2018 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price from our budget of 5650 per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately 7 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas from our budget of 300 per mmbtu would impact dcf by approximately 1 million 

in addition our expectations for 2018 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “risk factors” below for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2018 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

2017 tax reform 

while the recently enacted 2017 tax reform will ultimately be moderately positive for us the reduced corporate income tax rate caused certain of our deferredtax assets to be revalued at 21 percent versus 35 percent at the end of 2017 although there is no impact to the underlying related deductions which can continue to be used to offset future taxable income we took an estimated approximately 14 billion noncash accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 this charge is our initial estimate and may be refined in the future as permitted by recent guidance from the sec and fasb the positive impacts of the law include the reduced corporate income tax rate and the fact that several of our us business units essentially all but our interstate natural gas pipelines will be able to deduct 100 percent of their capital expenditures through 2022 the net impact results in postponing the date when we become a significant federal cash taxpayer by approximately one year to beyond 2024 

b financial information about segments 

for financial information on our five reportable business segments see note 16 “reportable segments” to our consolidated financial statements 

c narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

 

it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances however as discussed under item 1a “risk factors”  below there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 

we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and full and partial divestitures and we are currently contemplating potential transactions any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions receipt of fairness opinions and approval of our board of directors if applicable while there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations 

business segments 

we operate the following reportable business segments these segments and their principal sources of revenues are as follows 

 

natural gas pipelines 

our natural gas pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our lng terminals and includes both ferc regulated and nonferc regulated assets 

our primary businesses in this segment consist of transportation storage natural gas sales gathering processing and treating and the terminaling of lng within this segment are i approximately 46000 miles of wholly owned natural gas pipelines and ii our equity interests in entities that have approximately 26000 miles of natural gas pipelines along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western us louisiana texas the midwest northeast rocky mountain midwest and southeastern regions our lng storage and regasification terminals also serve natural gas supply areas in the southeast the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines segment assets as of december 31 2017  the design capacity represents either transmission gathering or liquefaction capacity depending on the nature of the asset 







 

 

competition 

the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines segment our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines and their shippers for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service from time to time other projects are proposed that would compete with us we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including electricity coal propane fuel oils and renewables such as wind and solar several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

co 2   

our co 2  business segment produces transports and markets co 2  for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2  pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete 

package of co 2  supply transportation and technical expertise to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

sales and transportation activities 

our principal market for co 2  is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin our ownership of co 2  resources as of december 31 2017 includes 



 

 

co 2  segment pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2  pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2  for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years the tariffs charged on the wink crude oil pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission and the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline’s tariffs are regulated by the texas railroad commission the tariff charged on the cortez pipeline is based on a consent decree and the tariffs charged by our other co 2  pipelines are not regulated 

our ownership of co 2  and crude oil pipelines as of december 31 2017 includes 



 

 

oil and gas producing activities 

oil producing interests 

our ownership interests in oilproducing fields located in the permian basin of west texas include the following 



 

 

the following table sets forth productive wells service wells and drilling wells in the oil and gas fields in which we owned interests as of december 31 2017  the oil and gas producing fields in which we own interests are located in the permian basin area of west texas when used with respect to acres or wells “gross” refers to the total acres or wells in which we have a working interest and “net” refers to gross acres or wells multiplied in each case by the percentage working interest owned by us 



 

 

the following table reflects our wells that were completed in each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 



 

note the above table includes wells that were completed during each year regardless of the year in which drilling was initiated and does not include any wells where drilling and completion operations were not finalized as of the end of the applicable year a completed well refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil and gas a development well is a well drilled in an already discovered oil field a dry hole is reflected once the well has been abandoned and reported to the appropriate governmental agency 

  

the following table reflects the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage that we held as of december 31 2017 



our oil and gas producing activities are not significant and therefore we do not include the supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities under accounting standards codification topic 932 extractive activities  oil and gas 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2  include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2  resources and oxy usa inc which controls waste co 2  extracted from natural gas production in the val verde basin of west texas our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other co 2  pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2  to the denver city texas market area 

terminals 

our terminals segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product crude oil chemical ethanol and other liquid terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines segment and all of our petroleum coke steel and coal facilities our terminals are located throughout the us and in portions of canada we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition terminals’ marine operations include jones act qualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined petroleum products between us ports the following summarizes our terminals segment assets as of december 31 2017  



competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in north america based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil chemical pipeline and refining companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services in some locations competitors are smaller independent 

operators with lower cost structures our jones act qualified product tankers compete with other jones act qualified vessel fleets 

products pipelines 

 our products pipelines segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate and ngl pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes our significant products pipelines segment assets we own and operate as of december 31 2017  



 

 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products and railcars our products pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

kinder morgan canada 

our kinder morgan canada business segment includes the trans mountain pipeline system and a 25mile jet fuel pipeline system effective with kml’s may 2017 ipo the operating assets in our kinder morgan canada segment are included in kml operating assets in our terminals and products pipelines segments are also included in kml in which we retain a controlling interest and kml and these operating assets are included in our consolidated financial statements 

trans mountain pipeline system 

the trans mountain pipeline system tmpl originates at edmonton alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of british columbia the tmpl is 713 miles in length the capacity of the line at edmonton ranges from 300 mbbld when heavy crude oil represents 20 of the total throughput which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage to 400 mbbld with no heavy crude oil the tmpl mainline is a common carrier pipeline providing transportation services under a cost of service model that is negotiated with shippers and regulated by the neb although trans mountain takes custody of its shippers’ products it does not own any of the product it ships the tmpl system has posted tariff rates that are available to all shippers based on a monthly contract which varies according to the type of product being shipped as well as receipt and delivery points as such it provides service to producers marketers refineries and terminals who sell or resell products to domestic markets oil marketers and international shippers moving oil to such places as california washington state and asia 

we also own and operate a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of washington referred to as the puget sound pipeline system which is regulated by the ferc for tariffs and the us department of transportation for safety and integrity 

tmep 

kml continues to move forward with its c74 billion tmep that upon completion would provide western canadian crude oil producers with an additional 590  mbbld  of shipping capacity and tidewater access to the western us most notably states of washington california and hawaii and global markets most notably asia tmep has firm transportation services agreements with 13 companies for a total of 7075  mbbld  based on a capacity of 890  mbbld  the maximum amount that trans mountain anticipated the neb would authorize 

 see “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—general —kml—tmep construction progress” 

jet fuel pipeline system 

we also own and operate the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl 

competition 

although trans mountain is the only pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast it is subject to competition resulting from the shipment of oil from the western canadian sedimentary basis wcsb to markets other than the canadian and us west coast including shipments to refineries in ontario the us midwest and the us gulf coast in addition refineries in washington state and california which comprise an important point of sale on the us west coast have in the past been supplied primarily by crude oil from the alaska north slope as such there has historically been some competitive pressure on supply originating from the wcsb for sale in the states of washington and california refinery markets a further source of competition exists from the transportation of oil to the canadian west coast by rail we expect that such supply and demand conditions in the oil markets served from the canadian west coast will continue to impact the longterm value and economics of the tmpl system 

historically the jet fuel pipeline has transported a significant proportion of the jet fuel used at the vancouver international airport however the airport also receives jet fuel through other means including trucks and an airport approved and yet to be constructed jet fuel bargereceiving terminal near the airport the jet fuel pipeline systems’ supplying refinery was sold in 2017 as a result of that sale we are unable to predict whether and to what extent that refinery will continue to supply jet fuel to the jet fuel pipeline these developments have made it unclear how much jet fuel will continue to be available for shipment to the vancouver international airport by way of the jet fuel pipeline in the future we continue to assess our options relating to our jet fuel pipeline assets 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations includes the operations of kinder morgan tejas pipeline llc kinder morgan border pipeline llc kinder morgan texas pipeline llc kinder morgan north texas pipeline llc and the miermonterrey mexico pipeline system buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2  business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2  business segments in 2017 2016 and 2015 accounted for 22 19 and 20 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service 

the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc for further information see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations”  above 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay but while the rates may vary by shipper and circumstance pipelines must generally use the form of service agreement that is contained within their ferc approved tariff any deviation from the pro forma  service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitation i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  national agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official standards of mexico regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or “pipes act of 2016” requires phmsa among others to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to go above those standards for intrastate pipelines in compliance with the pipes act of 2016 we have implemented procedures for underground natural gas storage facilities 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few 

years in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may precipitate claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreign flagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the us secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire 

however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 279 million as of december 31 2017 our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately 279 million   to approximately 443 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate 

materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources for further information see  “—climate change”  below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and then the states have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggers a process under which epa will designate the areas of the country that are in or out of attainment with the new naaqs standard then certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly installed equipment and possibly require retrofitting existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co 2  and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements for example in august 2016 the epa rule regarding the “oil and natural gas sector emission standards for new and modified sources” otherwise known as the proposed new source performance standard nsps part ooooa rule became effective this rule is the first federal rule under the clean air act to regulate methane as a pollutant and impose additional pollution control and work practice requirements on applicable kmi facilities 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co 2  emission performance rates for power generating units that fire coal oil or natural gas the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved in october 2017 epa proposed to repeal the clean power plan the ultimate resolution of the final rule’s validity remains uncertain while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan final rule it remains unclear what effect the final rule if it comes into force might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa depending on the particular program we could be required to conduct monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the clean power plan could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2  business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees   

we employed 10897 fulltime people at december 31 2017  including approximately 801 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities depend in part on continued production of natural gas oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for oil natural gas ngl refined petroleum products co 2  coal steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand without additions to oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher 

production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

trends in the business environment such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions higher development costs or high feedstock prices that adversely impact demand could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets in addition changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of the products we handle each of these factors impacts our customers shipping through our pipelines or using our terminals which in turn could impact the prospects of new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts 

implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could reduce production of andor demand for the products we handle increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for the products we handle 

expanding our existing assets and constructing new assets is part of our growth strategy our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining or our inability to obtain permits and rightsofway as well as public opposition cost overruns inclement weather and other delays 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals have caused and may continue to cause delays in our construction projects these factors can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays or our inability to obtain a required permit or rightofway could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

for example our ability to continue and complete construction on the tmep may be inhibited delayed or stopped by a variety of factors some of which may be outside of our control including without limitation inabilities to overcome challenges posed by or related to regulatory approvals by federal provincial or municipal governments difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain permits including those that are required prior to construction such as the permits required under the species at risk act land agreements public opposition blockades legal and regulatory proceedings including judicial reviews injunctions detailed route hearings and land acquisition processes delays to ancillary projects that are required for the tmep including with respect to power lines and power supply increased costs andor cost overruns and inclement weather or significant weatherrelated events 

we face competition from other pipelines and terminals as well as other forms of transportation and storage 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation such as barge rail or truck that delivers the products 

we handle into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than 

those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors likewise competing terminals or other storage options 

may become more attractive to our customers to the extent that competitors offer the markets we serve with new 

transportation or storage options this could result in unused capacity on our pipelines and in our terminals if pipeline capacity 

remains unsubscribed our ability to recontract for expiring capacity at favorable rates or otherwise retain existing customers 

could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of the products we handle from both existing and 

proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and 

transport to destinations not served by us 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil 

and gas industry the steel industry the coal industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more 

geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region volatility in 

commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers 

which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us see  “—financial distress 

experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “—the volatility of oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipeline and products pipelines business segments” 

if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us 

or other key markets become more volatile or deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business financial 

condition and results of operations 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event 

they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as 

hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject 

to their own operating market and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 

in 2015 and 2016 several of our counterparties defaulted on their obligations to us and some have filed for bankruptcy 

protection for more information regarding the impact to our operating results from customer bankruptcies see item 7 

“ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations —segment earnings results—terminals”  we cannot provide any assurance that other financially distressed counterparties will not also 

default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if a counterparty files for bankruptcy protection we likely 

would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts that they owe to us additional counterparty defaults 

and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash 

flows furthermore in the case of financially distressed customers such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail 

their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial 

condition and cash flows 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties 

integrating new businesses and properties and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future 

acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets if we do not successfully integrate 

acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets 

involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in our size ii the diversion of 

management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of 

accounting budgeting reporting internal controls and other systems and iv difficulties in the retention and assimilation of 

necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve 

separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate 

redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we do not own substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines in the us have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state we likewise must obtain approval from various governmental entities to construct and operate our pipelines in canada particularly for the tmep   in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete 

construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and an increase in our costs 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to transportation and storage of the products we handle such as leaks releases explosions mechanical problems and damage caused by third parties additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions capsizing grounding and navigation errors these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses negatively impact our reputation and increase public opposition to our expansion or new build projects for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and cash flows while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices our co 2  business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas producing properties and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines segment depend to a large degree and certain businesses within our product pipelines segment depend to a lesser degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices for 2018 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our dcf by approximately 7 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact dcf by approximately 1 million 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political instability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks please read “ —our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income” 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas or a prolonged unfavorable price environment would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co 2  business segment’s proved reserves if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk” 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2  business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil ngl and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it may not be possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely eliminate our exposure to commodity prices therefore our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates —hedging activities”  and note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

a breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational it systems or those of third parties may adversely affect our business results of operation or harm our business reputation 

our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions the 

various uses of these it systems networks and services include but are not limited to controlling our pipelines and terminals 

with industrial control systems collecting and storing information and data processing transactions and handling other 

processing necessary to manage our business 

if any of our systems are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial 

costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to 

perform critical functions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations a significant failure 

compromise breach or interruption in our systems could result in a disruption of our operations customer dissatisfaction 

damage to our reputation and a loss of customers or revenues efforts by us and our vendors to develop implement and 

maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and any network and information 

systemsrelated events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

terrorist attacks including cyber sabotage or the threat of such attacks may adversely affect our business or harm our business reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber sabotage” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems the occurrence of a terrorist attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport in the third quarter of 2017 hurricane harvey caused 

disruptions in our operations and as of december 31 2017 we had incurred 27 million in repair costs to our assets near the texas gulf coast for more information regarding the impact of hurricane harvey on our assets and operating results see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

the increased financial reporting and other obligations of management resulting from kml’s obligations as a public company may divert management’s attention away from other business operations 

kml in which we own an approximate 70 interest completed its ipo in canada in may of 2017 certain of our officers and directors also serve as officers and directors of kml and we provide financial reporting support and other services as requested by kml and its controlled affiliates pursuant to a services agreement the increased obligations associated with providing support to kml as a public company may divert our management’s attention from other business concerns and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to financial reporting and other obligations that place significant demands on our management administrative operational legal internal audit and accounting resources the demands on our personnel will be intensified as they comply with the additional obligations applicable to kml 

if we are unable to retain our executive chairman chief executive officer or other executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders and steve kean our president and chief executive officer along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder and mr kean have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada and terminals 

business segments a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues cash flows and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 369 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned us subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities and reduce our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

kml and its subsidiaries are not part of the cross guarantee and are rated separately by credit rating agencies however because of our approximate 70 ownership interest in kml we could be indirectly affected if kml experiences material adverse changes in its credit ratings or access to capital 

acquisitions and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2017 approximately 104 billion of our approximately 369 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more limiting restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock and on our preferred stock or depositary shares these reflect our current judgment but as with any estimate they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “information regarding forwardlooking statements” at the beginning of this report if we elect to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders 

risks related to regulation 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state provincial and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability in addition a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the current us presidential administration because it remains unclear specifically what the current administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state provincial and local taxation ii rates which include tax reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vii the acquisition of other businesses viii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities ix reporting and information posting requirements x the maintenance of accounts and records and xi relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations unexpected policy changes or interpretations of existing laws or regulations including the 2017 tax reform applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—regulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could initiate proceedings or file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines which could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact on our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines in addition following the 2017 tax reform which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 various industry groups have petitioned the ferc to consider action with respect to tax recovery in existing jurisdictional rates any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act the oil pollution act or analogous state or provincial laws as a result of the presence or release of hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances into or through the environment and these laws may require response actions and remediation and may impose liability for natural resource and other damages private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2   “business and propertiesc narrative description of business— environmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines issued by the dot for pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climate change and related regulation could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report greenhouse gas emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2  for example from our mcelmo dome co 2  field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions include establishing greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business environmental matters—climate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition 

legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market in december 2016 the cftc reproposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided the doddfrank act related regulations and the reduction in competition due to derivatives industry consolidation have i increased the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduced the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduced the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and manned by predominately us crews our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal objectives 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 



  

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us and canadian energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 76 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2017  the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ terminal sales portfolio was approximately   six years 

our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil these assets are mostly feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to fee based arrangements some of which may include minimum volume commitments we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

the co 2  source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2017 had a remaining average contract life of approximately eight years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2018 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2018 budget approximately 97 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 3 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2  business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2  business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil ngl and co 2  sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 5840 per barrel in 2017 6152 per barrel in 2016 and 7311 per barrel in 2015 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 4961 per barrel in 2017 4136 per barrel in 2016 and 4756 per barrel in 2015 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ between terminals and tankers and depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts   which on average is approximately three years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are steel coal and petroleum coke for the most part we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic 

conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones act tankers as of december 31 2017 we have sixteen jones act qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are currently operating pursuant to multiyear fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have approximately 51 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to i longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or ii through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude and condensate pipelines in the us and canada are affected by the volumes of crude and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

kml 

the interest in the canadian business operations that we sold to the public on may 30 2017 in kml’s ipo represented an interest in all our operating assets in our kinder morgan canada business segment and our operating canadian assets in our terminals and products pipelines business segments these canadian assets include the trans mountain pipeline system including related terminaling assets the tmep the puget sound and jet fuel pipeline systems the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline system the vancouver wharves terminal and the north 40 terminal as well as three jointly controlled investments the edmonton rail terminal the alberta crude terminal and the base line terminal 

subsequent to the ipo we retained control of kml and as a result it remains consolidated in our consolidated financial statements the public ownership of the kml restricted voting shares is reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated balance sheets earnings attributable to the public ownership of kml are presented in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented after may 30 2017 kml transacts in andor uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency which affects segment results due to the variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates 

 subsequent to its ipo kml has obtained a credit facility and completed two preferred share offerings kmi expects kml to be a selffunding entity and does not anticipate making contributions to fund its growth or specifically to fund the tmep 

tmep permitting and construction progress 

tmep was approved by order in council on december 1 2016 with 157 conditions the province of british columbia bc stated its approval of the tmep on january 11 2017 with 37 conditions trans mountain has made filings with the neb and bc environment with respect to all of the federal and provincial conditions required prior to general construction the bc environmental assessment office eao has now released all condition filings required prior to general construction the neb has released sufficient approvals for proceeding with the westridge terminal and temporary infrastructure work phase trans mountain is now in receipt of a number of priority permits from regulatory authorities in alberta and bc including access to bc northern interior crown lands kml continues to make progress on approvals from the neb government of bc and government of alberta however as of the end of 2017 even with this progress tmep has 

yet to obtain numerous provincial and municipal permits and federal condition approvals necessary for construction 

on december 4 2017 kml announced that while tmep had made incremental progress during 2017 on permitting regulatory condition satisfaction and land access the scope and pace of the permits and approvals received to date did not allow for significant additional construction to begin at that time kml also stated that it must have a clear line of sight on the timely conclusion of the permitting and approvals processes before it would commit to full construction spending consistent with its primarily permitting strategy and to mitigate risk kml set its 2018 budget assuming tmep spend in the first part of 2018 would be focused primarily on advancing the permitting process rather than spending at full construction levels until kml has greater clarity on key permits approvals and judicial reviews in its january 17 2018 earnings press release kml announced a potential unmitigated delay to project completion of one year to december 2020 primarily due to the time required to file for process and obtain necessary permits and regulatory approvals as stated in trans mountains november 14 2017 motion to the neb discussed below it is critical for trans mountain to have certainty that once started the tmep can confidently be completed on schedule the tmep projected in service date remains subject to change due to risks and uncertainties described in “information regarding forwardlooking statements” “item 1a risk factors” elsewhere in this item 7 and in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements under the heading “tmep litigation” further as stated in kml’s january 17 2018 earnings press release if tmep continues to be faced with unreasonable regulatory risks due to a lack of clear processes to secure necessary permits    it may become untenable for trans mountains shareholders    to proceed trans mountain continues to proceed in water work at the westridge terminal 

on october 26 and november 14 2017 kml filed motions with the neb to resolve delays as they relate to the city of burnaby and to establish a fair transparent and expedited backstop process for resolving any similar delays in other provincial and municipal permitting processes on december 7 2017 the neb granted kml’s motion in respect to the city of burnaby and indicated that trans mountain is not required to comply with two sections of the city’s bylaws thereby allowing trans mountain to start work at its pipeline terminals subject to other permits or authorizations that may be required the neb indicated that it would release its reasons for decision at a later date on january 18 2018 the neb issued its reasons for decision on the burnaby motion and granted in part trans mountain’s motion for a backstop process establishing a generic process to hear any future motions as they relate to provincial and municipal permitting issues 

h earings were held in october and november 2017 related to two judicial reviews underway in the bc supreme court with respect to the environmental certificate granted to tmep by the province of bc separate judicial reviews pending in the federal court of appeal challenging the process leading to the federal government’s approval of tmep were heard by the court from october 2 to october 13 2017 decisions from the courts are expected in the coming months kmi is confident that the neb the federal government and the bc government properly assessed and weighed the various scientific and technical evidence through a comprehensive review process while taking into consideration varying interests on the tmep the approvals granted followed many years of engagement and consultation with communities aboriginal groups and individuals 

as of the end of the fourth quarter 2017 a cumulative c930 million has been spent on the tmep kml’s estimated total cost for the tmep is c74 billion c67 billion excluding capitalized equity financing costs construction related delays could result in increases to the estimated total costs however because the extent of the delay remains uncertain kml has not updated its cost estimate at this time 

2017 tax reform 

while the recently enacted 2017 tax reform will ultimately be moderately positive for us the reduced corporate income tax rate caused certain of our deferredtax assets to be revalued at 21 percent versus 35 percent at the end of 2017 although there is no impact to the underlying related deductions which can continue to be used to offset future taxable income we took an estimated approximately 14 billion noncash accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 this charge is our initial estimate and may be refined in the future as permitted by recent guidance from the sec and fasb the positive impacts of the law include the reduced corporate income tax rate and the fact that several of our us business units essentially all but our interstate natural gas pipelines will be able to deduct 100 percent of their capital expenditures through 2022 the net impact results in postponing the date when we become a significant federal cash taxpayer by approximately one year to beyond 2024 

we continue to assess the impact of the 2017 tax reform on our business in order to complete our analysis any adjustment to our provisional amount recorded during the year ended december 31 2017 will be reported in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined and may be material in the period in which the adjustments are made see note 5 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition and income taxes ii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iii the fair values used to a assign purchase price from business combinations b determine possible asset and equity investment impairment charges and c calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iv reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities v provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables and vi exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

acquisition method of accounting   

for acquired businesses we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3   “acquisitions and divestitures”   to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see part i items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business— environmental matters ” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal and regulatory matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

hedging activities 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices foreign currency exposure on euro denominated debt and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14   “risk management”   to our consolidated financial statements 

  

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2017  our pension plans were underfunded by   686 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by   90 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2017  we had deferred net losses of approximately  547 million  in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2017  

 

 

income taxes 

  

income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to not be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments 

results of operations 

overview 

our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of segment ebda and as discussed below under “—nongaap measures”  dcf and segment ebda before certain items segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

consolidated earnings results 



 

 certain items affecting total segment ebda see “—nongaap measures” below  



 

year ended december 31 2017 vs 2016 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c and d to the table above accounted for 555 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016 representing the difference between decreases of 360 million and 915 million in income before income taxes for 2017 and 2016 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows the remaining decrease of 32 million 1 from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to decreased performance from our natural gas pipelines business segment largely associated with our sale of a 50 interest in sng to the southern company southern company on september 1 2016 and increased dda expense partially offset by decreased general and administrative expense and decreased interest expense 

year ended december 31 2016 vs 2015 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c and d to the table above accounted for 866 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015 representing the difference between decreases of 915 million and 1781 million in income before income taxes for 2016 and 2015 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows income before income taxes for 2016 when compared to the prior year was flat increased results in our products pipelines and terminals business segments and decreased dda expense and interest expense net were offset by unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co 2  business segment and decreased results on our natural gas pipelines business segment the decrease in dda was primarily driven by lower dda in our co 2  business segment and the decrease in interest expense was due to lower weighted average debt balances partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap performance measures are dcf both in the aggregate and per share and segment ebda before certain items certain items as used to calculate our nongaap measures are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements enactment of new tax legislation and casualty losses 

our nongaap performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of dcf and segment ebda before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

dcf 

  

dcf is calculated by adjusting net income available to common stockholders before certain items for dda total book and cash taxes sustaining capital expenditures and other items dcf is a significant performance measure useful to management and external users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance and in measuring and estimating the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of dcf to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends 

segment ebda before certain items 

        segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and 

therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dda and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda 

in the tables for each of our business segments under “— segment earnings results”  below segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting the segment ebda for the applicable certain item amounts which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables

kinder morgan canada 



 

   

for the comparable years of 2017 and 2016 the kinder morgan canada business segment had an increase in segment ebda of 5 million 3 and an increase in revenues of 3 million 1 primarily due to i higher capitalized equity financing costs due to spending on the tmep ii currency translation gains due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and iii higher incentive revenues partly offset by lower state of washington volumes and operating expense timing changes 

for the comparable years of 2016 and 2015 the kinder morgan canada business segment had a decrease in segment ebda of 1 million 1 and a decrease in revenues of 7 million 3 

general and administrative interest corporate and noncontrolling interests   



 

certain items 

 

general and administrative expenses and corporate charges before certain items decreased 20 million in 2017 and increased 17 million in 2016 when compared with the respective prior year the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily driven by the sale of a 50 interest in our sng natural gas pipeline system effective september 1 2016 higher capitalized costs lower state franchise taxes legal and insurance costs partially offset by higher labor accruals and pension costs the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher benefit costs higher corporate charges and lower capitalized costs partially offset by lower labor outside services and insurance costs 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income before certain items decreased 128 million in 2017 and 79 million in 2016 respectively when compared with the respective prior year the decrease in interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances as proceeds from the may 2017 kml ipo and our september 2016 sale of a 50 interest in sng were used to pay down debt partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt the decrease in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of both december 31 2017  and 2016 approximately 28 of our debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rateseither as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “risk management— interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items for 2017 as compared to 2016 increased 19 million 90 due to the may 30 2017 sale of approximately 30 of our canadian business operations to the public in the kml ipo the portion of our canadian business operations net income attributable to the public is now reflected in “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items for 2016 as compared to 2015 increased 3 million 17 

income taxes 

  

year ended december 31 2017 versus year ended december 31 2016 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 is approximately 1938 million as compared with 2016 tax expense of 917 million the 1021 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to i an increase in yearoveryear earnings as a result of fewer asset impairments and project writeoffs in 2017 and ii higher tax expense as a result of the 2017 tax reform these increases are partially offset by i the 2016 impact of our regulated natural gas pipeline segment’s 817 million nontaxdeductible goodwill as a result of the sale of a 50 interest in sng and ii the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits 

year ended december 31 2016 versus year ended december 31 2015 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2016 is approximately 917 million as compared with 2015 tax expense of 564 million the 353 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to i an increase in our earnings as a result of lower impairments in 2016 ii the year over year increase in the deferred state tax expense as a result of our sale of a 50 interest in sng in 2016 and the hiland acquisition in 2015 and iii valuation allowances recorded in 2016 for foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards for which we do not expect to recognize any future tax benefits these increases are partially offset by adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2017  we had 264 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” a decrease of 420 million   61  from december 31 2016  we believe our cash position remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4601 million  and 4795 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the yeartoyear decrease is discussed below in “cash flows—operating activities” we have primarily relied on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures dividend payments and during the last two years our growth capital expenditures 

we expect kml to fund the tmep’s capital expenditures and its other capital expenditures through i additional borrowings on kml’s credit facility ii the additional issuance of kml preferred shares iii the issuance of additional kml restricted voting stock iv the issuance of kml longterm notes payable and v kml’s retained cash flow from operations or a combination of the above kml established a dividend policy on its restricted voting shares pursuant to which it will pay its quarterly dividend in an amount based on a portion of its dcf discussed below in “—noncontrolling interests—kml restricted voting share dividends” 

on june 16 2017 kml’s indirect subsidiaries kinder morgan cochin ulc and trans mountain pipeline ulc entered into a definitive credit agreement establishing i a c40 billion  revolving construction facility for the purposes of funding the development construction and completion of the tmep ii a c10 billion  revolving contingent credit facility for the purpose of funding if necessary additional tmep costs and subject to the need to fund such additional costs and regulatory approval meeting the canadian nebmandated liquidity requirements and iii a c500 million  revolving working capital facility to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes collectively the “kml credit facility” on january 23 2018 kml entered into an agreement amending certain terms of its credit facility to among other things provide additional funding certainty with respect to each tranche of its credit facility the kml credit facility has a fiveyear term and is with a syndicate of financial institutions with royal bank of canada as the administrative agent as of december 31 2017  kml had no amounts outstanding under the kml credit facility and c 53 million  us 42 million  in letters of credit in addition 

kml received c537 million  us 420 million  of net proceeds from the issuance of series 1 preferred shares in august 2017 and series 3 preferred shares in december 2017 

generally we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations shortterm borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt to refinance certain of our maturing longterm debt obligations we also expect that kmi’s current common stock dividend level will allow us to use retained cash to fund our growth projects and the previously mentioned share repurchase program in 2018 moreover as a result of kmi’s current common stock dividend policy and by continuing to focus on allocating capital to high return opportunities we do not expect the need to access the equity capital markets to fund our other growth projects for the foreseeable future 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings generally we anticipate refinancing maturing long term debt obligations in the debt capital markets and are therefore subject to certain market conditions which could result in higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

as of december 31 2017  our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a3 prime3 and f3 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

 the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2017  



  

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2017  our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i our 50 billion  revolving credit facility and associated 40 billion  commercial paper program ii the kml credit facility for the purposes described above and iii cash from operations the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under ours and kml’s respective credit facilities we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and as previously discussed we have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2017  our 2828 million  of shortterm debt consisted primarily of i 125 million  outstanding borrowings under the kmi 50 billion  revolving credit facility ii  240 million  outstanding under our 40 billion  commercial paper program and iii 2284 million  of senior notes that mature in the next year we intend to refinance our shortterm debt through credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt or paying down shortterm debt using cash retained from operations our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2016  was 2696 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 3466 million  and 2695 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 771 million   29  unfavorable change from yearend 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in cash and restricted deposits and a net increase in our current portion of longterm debt and accounts payable generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “—longterm financing” and “— capital expenditures” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated 

consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock each with a par value of 001 per share we have in place an equity distribution agreement which allows us to issue and sell through or to our sales agents andor principals shares of our class p common stock however with the exception of the issuance of kml preferred equity andor common equity to partially finance the tmep or other kml capital expenditures we do not expect the need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future furthermore we began repurchasing shares of our class p common stock under a 2 billion  share buyback program in december 2017 that we intend to fund through retained cash for more information on our equity buyback program and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries have issued longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee the debt of each other see note 19 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 34088 million  and 36205 million  respectively for more information regarding our debtrelated transactions in 2017  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

for additional information about our debtrelated transactions in 2017  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk— interest rate risk ” 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “results of operations—dcf” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally 

expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are see “—common dividends” and “—preferred dividends” 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2017  and the amount we expect to spend for 2018 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

dividends and stock buyback program 

kmi common stock dividends 

 the table below reflects the payment of cash dividends of 050  per common share for 2017  

as previously announced as a result of substantial balance sheet improvement achieved since the end of 2015 we have taken multiple steps to return significant value to our shareholders first we expect to declare an annual dividend of 080 per common share for 2018 a 60 increase from the 2017 dividend per common share the first 2018 increase is expected to be the dividend declared for the first quarter of 2018 additionally we plan to increase our dividend to 100 per common share in 2019 and 125 per common share in 2020 a growth rate of 25 annually 

the actual amount of common dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “risk factors— the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common stock dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november 

kmi preferred stock dividends 

dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock are payable on a cumulative basis when as and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof at an annual rate of 9750  of the liquidation preference of 1000  per share on january 26 april 26 july 26 and october 26 of each year commencing on january 26 2016 to and including october 26 2018 we may pay dividends in cash or subject to certain limitations in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock 



the cash dividend of 24375  per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is equivalent to 121875  per depository share 

stock buyback program 

on july 19 2017 our board of directors approved a 2 billion  common share buyback program that began in december 2017 during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased approximately 14 million  of our class p shares for approximately 250 million  subsequent to december 31 2017 and through february 8 2018 we repurchased approximately 13 million  of our class p shares for approximately 250 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the 

maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we use include energy products traded on the nymex and otc markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas ngl and crude oil derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value in millions 



 as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the natural gas ngl and crude oil portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances including debt fair value adjustments and the preferred interest in kmgp and sensitivity to interest rates in millions 



 

 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2017  including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 28  of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency risk 

as of december 31 2017 we had a notional principal amount of 1358 million  of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixed rate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

we are one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in north america we own an interest in or operate approximately 84000 miles of pipelines and 155 terminals our pipelines transport natural gas refined petroleum products crude oil condensate co 2  and other products and our terminals transload and store petroleum products ethanol and chemicals and handle such products as steel coal and petroleum coke we are also a leading producer of co 2  which we and others utilize for enhanced oil recovery projects primarily in the permian basin our common stock trades on the nyse under the symbol “kmi” 

a general development of business 

  

organizational structure 

  

we are a delaware corporation and our common stock has been publicly traded since february 2011 prior to november 2014 we conducted most of our business through two master limited partnerships kmp whose business and affairs were managed by kmr a publicly traded limited liability company and epb 

on november 26 2014 we completed our acquisition pursuant to three separate merger agreements of all of the outstanding common units of kmp and epb and all of the outstanding shares of kmr that we did not already own the transactions are referred to collectively as the “merger transactions” 

as we controlled each of kmp kmr and epb before and continued to control each of them after the merger transactions the changes in our ownership interest in each of kmp kmr and epb were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statements of income related to the merger transactions after closing the merger transactions kmr was merged with and into kmi 

prior to the merger transactions we owned an approximate 10 limited partner interest including our interest in kmr and the 2 general partner interest including incentive distribution rights in kmp and an approximate 39 limited partner interest and the 2 general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in epb effective with the merger transactions the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of kmp were eliminated 

the equity interests in kmp epb and kmr which are all consolidated in our financial statements owned by the public prior to the merger transactions are reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity the earnings recorded by kmp epb and kmr that were attributed to the units and shares respectively held by the public prior to the merger transactions are reported as “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2014 

additionally on january 1 2015 epb and its subsidiary eppoc merged with and into kmp as a result of such merger all of the subsidiaries of epb and eppoc became wholly owned subsidiaries of kmp references to epb refer to epb for periods prior to its merger into kmp

recent developments 

the following is a brief listing of significant developments and updates related to our major projects and other transactions additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report “capital scope” is estimated for our share of the described project which may include portions not yet completed 







 

na  not applicable 

financings 

on august 16 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary cig completed a private offering of 375 million  in aggregate principal amount of 415  senior notes due august 15 2026 on september 30 2016 and october 1 2016 a portion of the proceeds from the sale of a 50  interest in sng was used to repay all of the 332 million  principal amount outstanding of copano’s 7125  senior notes due 2021 plus accrued interest and all of the 749 million  principal amount outstanding of hiland’s 725  senior notes due 2020 plus accrued interest respectively 

current commodity price environment 

item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” as well as note 4 “impairments and losses on divestitures” and note 8 “goodwill” to our consolidated financial statements discuss the impacts of the current commodity price environment on the energy industry including our customers and us refer to the developments addressed in these sections including the resulting noncash impairment charges related to goodwill certain longlived assets and equity method investments for a more general discussion of these related risk factors refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

2017 outlook 

we expect to declare dividends of 050 per share for 2017 and generate approximately 446 billion of distributable cash flow we also expect to invest 32 billion on expansion projects during 2017 to be funded with internally generated cash flow without the need to access equity markets our 2017 budget assumes a joint venture partner on our trans mountain expansion project and contributions from that partner to fund its share of expansion capital but does not include any potential proceeds in excess of the partner’s share of expansion capital to recognize the value created in developing the project to this stage we are unable to provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow due to the inherent difficulty and impracticality of predicting certain amounts required by gaap such as ineffectiveness on commodity interest rate and foreign currency hedges unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities 

these expectations assume an average 2017 wti crude oil price of 53 per barrel and an average 2017 henry hub natural gas price of 3 per mmbtu which were consistent with the current forward curve at the time that our 2017 budget was prepared 

the overwhelming majority of cash we generate is supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co 2  segment where we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil production to minimize this sensitivity for 2017 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately 6 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact distributable cash flow by approximately 1 million 

  in addition our expectations for 2017 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “risk factors” below for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2017 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis

our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales transportation storage gathering processing and treating and the terminaling of lng within this segment are i approximately 46000 miles of natural gas pipelines and ii our equity interests in entities that have approximately 26000 miles of natural gas pipelines along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western us louisiana texas the midwest northeast rocky mountain midwest and southeastern regions our lng storage and regasification terminals also serve natural gas supply areas in the southeast the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines segment assets as of december 31 2016  the design capacity represents either transmission gathering or liquefaction capacity depending on the nature of the asset 





competition 

the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines and their shippers for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service from time to time other projects are proposed that would compete with us we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including electricity coal propane fuel oils and renewables such as wind and solar several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

co 2   

our co 2  business segment produces transports and markets co 2  for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2  pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co 2  supply transportation and technical expertise to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

sales and transportation activities 

our principal market for co 2  is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years our ownership of co 2  resources as of december 31 2016 includes 



 

 

co 2  segment pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2  pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2  for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years the tariffs charged on the wink pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission and the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline’s tariffs are regulated by the texas railroad commission the tariff charged on the cortez pipeline is based on a consent decree and the tariffs charged by our other co 2  pipelines are not regulated

note the above table includes wells that were completed during each year regardless of the year in which drilling was initiated and does not include any wells where drilling and completion operations were not finalized as of the end of the applicable year a completed well refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil and gas a development well is a well drilled in an already discovered oil field a dry hole is reflected once the well has been abandoned and reported to the appropriate governmental agency prior year amounts have been adjusted to be consistent with the current period presentation 

  

the following table reflects the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage that we held as of december 31 2016 



 

note as of december 31 2016 we have no material amount of acreage expiring in the next three years 

our oil and gas producing activities are not significant and therefore we do not include the supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities under accounting standards codification topic 932 extractive activities  oil and gas 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2  include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2  resources and oxy usa inc which controls waste co 2  extracted from natural gas production in the val verde basin of west texas our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are 

in direct competition with other co 2  pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2  to the denver city texas market area 

terminals 

our terminals segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product crude oil chemical ethanol and other liquid terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines segment and all of our coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk terminal facilities our terminals are located throughout the us and in portions of canada we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition terminals’ marine operations include jones act qualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined petroleum products in the us the following summarizes our terminals segment assets as of december 31 2016  



competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in north america based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil chemical pipeline and refining companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services in some locations competitors are smaller independent operators with lower cost structures our jones act qualified product tankers compete with other jones act qualified vessel fleets 

products pipelines 

 our products pipelines segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate and ngl pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes our significant products pipelines segment assets we own and operate as of december 31 2016  



 

 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products and railcars our products pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

kinder morgan canada 

our kinder morgan canada business segment includes our 100 owned and operated trans mountain pipeline system and a 25mile jet fuel pipeline system 

trans mountain pipeline system 

the trans mountain pipeline system originates at edmonton alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of british columbia the trans mountain pipeline is 713 miles in length we also own and operate a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of washington the 

capacity of the line at edmonton ranges from 300 mbbld when heavy crude oil represents 20 of the total throughput which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage to 400 mbbld with no heavy crude oil 

jet fuel pipeline system 

we also own and operate the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl 

competition 

trans mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and it competes against other pipeline providers however it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast furthermore as demonstrated by our previously announced expansion proposal discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—kinder morgan canada” we believe that the trans mountain pipeline facilities provide us the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop 

in december 2013 the british columbia ministry of environment granted approval for a new airport fuel consortium owned jet fuel terminal to be located near the vancouver international airport the impact of this facility on our existing jet fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations includes the operations of kinder morgan tejas pipeline llc kinder morgan border pipeline llc kinder morgan texas pipeline llc kinder morgan north texas pipeline llc and the miermonterrey mexico pipeline system buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2  business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2  business segments in 2016 2015 and 2014 accounted for 19 20 and 25 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

the energy policy act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates 

certain rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service our subsidiary trans mountain pipeline lp is the sole owner of our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 

the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc for further information see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” above 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay but while the rates may vary by shipper and circumstance pipelines must generally use the form of service agreement that is contained within their ferc approved tariff any deviation from the pro forma  service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 



 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulatory commission the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitations i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

mexico  nacional agency for industrial safety and environmental protection asea 

asea regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety the miermonterrey pipeline must satisfy and maintain asea’s requirements including compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety including a safety administration program 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of 2016 or “pipes act of 2016” requires phmsa among others to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to go above those standards for intrastate pipelines the act also authorizes emergency order authority that is tailored to the pipeline sector taking into account public health and safety network and customer impacts the financial impact of these two requirements if any is unknown at this time 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may precipitate claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreign flagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the us secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 302 million as of december 31 2016 our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately 302 million   to approximately 477 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify 

any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and then the states have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggers a process under which epa will designate the areas of the country that are in or out of attainment with the new naaqs standard then certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly installed equipment and possibly require retrofitting existing kmi facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and 

also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co 2  and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements additionally in june 2016 the epa published a proposed rule regarding the “oil and natural gas sector emission standards for new and modified sources” otherwise known as the proposed new source performance standard nsps part ooooa rule this rule is the first federal rule under the clean air act to regulate methane as a pollutant and would impose additional pollution control and work practice requirements on applicable kmi facilities 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co 2  emission performance rates for power generating units that fire coal oil or natural gas the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved the ultimate resolution of the final rule’s validity remains uncertain while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan final rule it remains unclear what effect the final rule if it comes into force might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa depending on the particular program we could be required to conduct monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the proposed clean power plan could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2  business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently 

cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees   

we employed 11121 fulltime people at december 31 2016  including approximately 907 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2017 and 2022 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities depend in part on continued production of natural gas oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for oil natural gas coal steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand 

without additions to oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

trends in the business environment such as declining or sustained low commodity prices supply disruptions higher development costs or high feedstock prices that adversely impact demand could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets in addition changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil natural gas coal and other products each of these factors impacts our customers shipping through our pipelines or using our terminals which in turn could impact the prospects of new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts 

implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could reduce production of andor demand for natural gas crude oil refined petroleum products coal and other hydrocarbons increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for natural gas crude oil refined petroleum products and other products we handle 

our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and newbuild projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway public opposition cost overruns inclement weather and other delays 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals that can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects have caused and may continue to cause delays in our construction projects inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have also resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

we do not own substantially all of the land on which our pipelines are located if we are unable to procure and maintain access to land owned by third parties our revenue and operating costs and our ability to complete construction projects could be adversely affected 

we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land including private landowners railroads public utilities and others while our interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority the availability of eminent domain authority for our other pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state in any case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court if we are unable to obtain rightsofway on acceptable terms our ability to complete construction projects on time on budget or at all could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rightofway or rental agreements with landowners primarily through renewals of expiring agreements and rental increases if we were to lose these rights our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to relocate the affected pipelines which could cause a substantial decrease in our revenues and cash flows and increase our costs 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating market and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 

in the last two years several of our counterparties defaulted on their obligations to us and some have filed for bankruptcy protection for more information regarding the impact to our operating results from customer bankruptcies see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsresults of operationssegment earnings resultsterminals” we cannot provide any assurance that other financially distressed counterparties will not also default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if a counterparty files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts that they owe to us additional counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows furthermore in the case of financially distressed customers such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry the coal industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us see “ —financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “ —the volatility of oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipeline and products pipelines business segments” 

if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties integrating   new properties and businesses and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in our size ii the diversion of 

management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting budgeting reporting and other systems and iv difficulties in the retention and assimilation of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we face competition from other pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil petroleum products or natural gas into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems for example several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to transportation and storage of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products co 2  coal chemicals and other products such as leaks releases explosions mechanical problems and damage caused by third parties additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions capsizing grounding and navigation errors these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and cash flows while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co 2  business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil natural gas and ngl prices our co 2  business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas producing properties and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines segment depend to a large degree and certain businesses within our product pipelines segment depend to a lesser degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices for 2017 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately 6 million each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact distributable cash flow by approximately 1 million and each 1 change in the ratio of the weightedaverage ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel would impact distributable cash flow by approximately 3 million 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political instability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks please read “ —our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income” 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas or a prolonged unfavorable price environment would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co 2  business segment’s proved reserves if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk” 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2  business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil ngl and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that eliminate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may 

reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies and estimateshedging activities” and note 13 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events or the threat of them may adversely affect our business or harm our business reputation 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems a cyber security event could affect our ability to operate or control our facilities or disrupt our operations also customer information could be stolen the occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition or harm our business reputation 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and difficulties recruiting and retaining our workforce could result in a failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our executive chairman or other executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders and steve kean our president and chief executive officer along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder and mr kean have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

our kinder morgan canada and terminals segments are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada business segments a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues cash flows and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 39 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt and our ability to meet our consolidated leverage targets will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may also take such actions to reduce our indebtedness if we determine that our earnings or consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda as calculated in accordance with our revolving credit facility may not be sufficient to meet our consolidated leverage targets or to comply with consolidated leverage ratios required under certain of our debt agreements we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar terms which could in turn limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities and reduce our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities and the terms available to us for future issuances of debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our acquisition strategy and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 11 billion of our approximately 39 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock and on our preferred stock or depositary shares this reflects our current judgment but as with any estimate it may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and other risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “information regarding forwardlooking statements” if we elect to pay dividends at the anticipated level and that action would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations to maintain our leverage metrics or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business could be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends may decide to address those matters by reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends we could choose to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “ —risks related to financing our business—our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the us further stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders 

risks related to regulation 

new laws policies regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes to those currently in effect could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state provincial and local regulatory authorities legislative changes as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability in addition a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the recent change in us presidential administrations it remains unclear specifically what the new administration may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i federal state provincial and local taxation ii rates which include tax reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service iii the types of services we may offer to our customers iv the contracts for service entered into with our customers v the certification and construction of new facilities vi the integrity 

safety and security of facilities and operations vii the acquisition of other businesses viii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities ix reporting and information posting requirements x the maintenance of accounts and records and xi relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws regulations or policy changes sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to our income operations assets or another aspect of our business could have a material adverse impact on our earnings cash flow financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessregulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state or provincial laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several 

liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines issued by the dot for pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane and co 2  including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report greenhouse gas emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co 2  for example from our mcelmo dome co 2  field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions include establishing greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market in december 2016 the cftc reproposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided the doddfrank act related regulations and the reduction in competition due to derivatives industry consolidation have i significantly increased the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduced the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduced the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and manned by predominately us crews our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an 

unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal objectives 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

   

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us and canadian energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport or store natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 77 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2016  the remaining weighted average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ purchase and sales contracts was approximately   six years 

our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil these assets are generally feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to fee based arrangements we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts some of which may include minimum volume requirements our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

the co 2  source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2016 had a remaining average contract life of approximately nine years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2017 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2017 budget approximately 98 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 2 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2  business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2  business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil ngl and co 2  sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with the hedges allocated to oil was 6152 per barrel in 2016 7311 per barrel in 2015 and 8841 per barrel in 2014 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 4136 per barrel in 2016 4756 per barrel in 2015 and 8648 per barrel in 2014 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts   which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our 

services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are steel coal and petroleum coke for the most part we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods in addition to liquid and bulk terminals we also own jones act tankers as of december 31 2016 we have twelve jones act qualified tankers that operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are currently operating pursuant to multiyear predominately fixed price charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have approximately 55 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to i longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or ii through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude and condensate pipelines in the us and canada are affected by the volumes of crude and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

a portion of our business portfolio transacts in andor uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency which affects segment results due to the variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates our canadian operations are included in three of our business segments i our kinder morgan canada segment which is comprised of the trans mountain pipeline an oversubscribed common carrier crude oil and refined petroleum pipeline serving western canada the trans mountain puget pipeline serving washington state and the jet fuel pipeline serving vancouver international airport ii terminal facilities located in western canada that are included in our terminals business segment and iii the canadian portion of our cochin pipeline which is included in our products pipelines business segment 

  

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i revenue recognition and income taxes ii the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates iii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset and equity investment impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iv reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities v provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables and vi exposures under contractual indemnifications 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

acquisition method of accounting   

for acquired businesses we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal and regulatory matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

hedging activities 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices foreign currency exposure on euro denominated debt and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value we utilize published prices broker quotes and estimates of market prices to estimate the fair value of these contracts however actual amounts could vary materially from estimated fair values as a result of changes in market prices in addition changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts for more information on our hedging activities see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2016  our pension plans were underfunded by   724 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by   141 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans which applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2016  we had deferred net losses of approximately 613 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2016  

 

 

income taxes 

  

income tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are effective we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments 

results of operations 

overview 

our management evaluates our performance primarily using the measures of segment ebda and as discussed below under “—nongaap measures” distributable cash flow or dcf and segment ebda before certain items segment ebda is a useful measure of our operating performance because it measures the operating results of our segments before dda and certain expenses that are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers such as general and administrative expenses interest expense net and income taxes our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

segment results for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the elimination of the other segment as a reportable segment the activities that previously comprised the other segment are now presented within the corporate nonsegment activities in reconciling to the consolidated totals in the respective segment reporting tables the other segment had historically been comprised primarily of legacy operations of acquired businesses not associated with our ongoing operations these business activities have since been sold or have otherwise ceased in addition the other segment included certain company owned real estate assets which are primarily leased to our operating subsidiaries as well as third party tenants this activity is now reflected within corporate activity in addition the portions of interest income and income tax expense previously allocated to our business segments are now included in “interest expense net” and “income tax expense” for all periods presented in the following tables 

consolidated earnings results 



 

 certain items affecting total segment ebda see “—nongaap measures” below  



year ended december 31 2016 vs 2015 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c d and e to the table above accounted for 866 million of the increase in income before income taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015 representing the difference between decreases of 915 million and 1781 million in income before income taxes for 2016 and 2015 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows income before income taxes for 2016 when compared to the prior year was flat increased results in our products pipelines and terminals business segments and decreased dda expense and interest expense net were offset by unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co 2  business segment and decreased results on our natural gas pipelines business segment the decrease in dda was primarily driven by lower dda in our co 2  business segment and the decrease in interest expense was due to lower weighted average debt balances partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt 

year ended december 31 2015 vs 2014 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c d and e to the table above accounted for 1767 million of the decrease in income before income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 representing the difference between decreases of 1781 million and 14 million in income before income taxes for 2015 and 2014 respectively after giving effect to these certain items which are discussed in more detail in the discussion that follows the remaining decrease of 552 million 18 from the prior year in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to increased dda expense general and administrative expense and interest expense net as explained further below our total segment earnings before dda did not change significantly when compared to the prior year as unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co 2  business segment were offset by increased results from our products pipelines terminals and natural gas pipelines business segments 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap performance measures are dcf both in the aggregate and per share and segment ebda before certain items certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either i do not have a cash impact for example asset impairments or ii by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically for example certain legal settlements hurricane impacts and casualty losses 

our nongaap performance measures described below should not be considered alternatives to gaap net income or other gaap measures and have important limitations as analytical tools our computations of dcf and segment ebda before certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others you should not consider these nongaap performance measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap dcf should not be used as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities computed under gaap management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap performance measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

distributable cash flow 

  

dcf is a significant performance measure used by us and by external users of our financial statements to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt and preferred stock dividends paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends stock repurchases retirement of debt or expansion capital expenditures management uses this performance measure and believes it provides users of our financial statements a useful performance measure reflective of our business’s ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable gaap measure we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to dcf is net income available to common stockholders a reconciliation of dcf to net income available to common stockholders is provided in the table below dcf per share is dcf divided by average outstanding shares including restricted stock awards that participate in dividends 

segment ebda before certain items 

        segment ebda before certain items is used by management in its analysis of segment performance and management of our business general and administrative expenses are generally not under the control of our segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance we believe segment ebda before certain items is a significant performance metric because it provides us and external users of our financial statements additional insight into the ability of our segments to generate segment cash earnings on an ongoing basis we believe it is useful to 

investors because it is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources to our segments and assess each segment’s performance we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to segment ebda before certain items is segment earnings before dda and amortization of excess cost of equity investments segment ebda 

in the tables for each of our business segments under “— segment earnings results” below segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting the segment ebda for the applicable certain item amounts which are totaled in the tables and described in the footnotes to those tables

general and administrative interest corporate and noncontrolling interests   



 

certain items 



a 1 million decrease respectively in interest expense primarily related to noncash trueups of our estimates of swap ineffectiveness 2014 amount also includes i increases in expense of 9 million of amortization of capitalized financing fees ii 12 million of interest expense on margin for marketing contracts associated with legacy operations and iii 27 million of interest expense related to the merger transactions 

 other 

 

general and administrative expenses before certain items increased 12 million in 2016 and 26 million in 2015 when compared with the respective prior year the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and lower capitalized costs partially offset by lower labor outside services and insurance costs the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily driven by the acquisition of hiland effective february 13 2015 lower capitalized costs and higher labor expenses partially offset by lower benefit and insurance costs 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income before certain items decreased 79 million in 2016 and increased 277 million in 2015 respectively when compared with the respective prior year the decrease in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower weighted average debt balances partially offset by a slightly higher overall weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher weighted average debt balances as a result of capital expenditures joint venture contributions and acquisitions that were made during 2014 and 2015 and incremental debt borrowings to fund the 39 billion cash portion of the merger transactions in november 2014 

we use interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2016  and 2015 approximately 28 and 27 respectively of our debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rateseither as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “risk management— interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

after taking into effect the certain items the corporate expense for 2016 and 2015 increased by 5 million for each respective period when compared with the respective prior year 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests before certain items for 2016 as compared to 2015 increased 3 million 17 the 1399 million decrease 99 for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our purchase of the kmp and epb limited partner units and kmr shares formerly owned by the public in the fourth quarter of 2014 as part of the merger transactions 

income taxes 

  

year ended december 31 2016 versus year ended december 31 2015 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2016 is approximately 917 million as compared with 2015 tax expense of 564 million the 353 million increase in tax expense is primarily due to i an increase in our earnings as a result of lower impairments in 2016 ii the year over year increase in the deferred state tax expense as a result of our sale of a 50 interest in sng in 2016 and the hiland acquisition in 2015 and iii valuation allowances recorded in 2016 for foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards for which we do not expect to recognize any future tax benefits these increases are partially offset by adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions 

year ended december 31 2015 versus year ended december 31 2014 

our tax expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was 564 million as compared with 2014 tax expense of 648 million the 84 million decrease in tax expense is due primarily to i the tax impact of lower pretax earnings in 2015 primarily due to our recognition of 929 million of impairments on longlived assets and investments and 1150 million 

goodwill impairment of natural gas pipelines nonregulated midstream assets of which 882 million is not tax deductible ii the tax benefit of an increase in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the hiland acquisition iii the 2014 recording of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl and iv the elimination as a result of the merger transactions of the amortization of the deferred charge recorded as a result of the dropdowns of tgp epng and the midstream assets these decreases are partially offset by the 2014 benefit of a worthless stock deduction related to our brazil operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had 684 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” an increase of 455 million   199  from december 31 2015  we believe our cash position remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below 

we have consistently generated substantial cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4787 million  and 5303 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the yeartoyear decrease is discussed below in “cash flows—operating activities” we have relied on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures and dividend payments and during 2016 to fund our expansion capital expenditures 

on september 1 2016 we completed the sale of a 50  interest in our sng natural gas pipeline system to southern company receiving proceeds of approximately 14 billion  we used the proceeds from this transaction to reduce outstanding debt in addition to repaying outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings proceeds from the sale were also used on september 30 2016 to repay the 332 million  principal amount of copano’s 7125  notes due 2021 and on october 1 2016 to repay the 749 million  principal amount of hiland’s 725  senior notes due 2020 see note 9 “debt” as of september 1 2016 sng had 1211 million  of debt outstanding including a current portion of 500 million  which is no longer consolidated on our balance sheet 

on august 16 2016 cig completed a private offering of 375 million  in principal amount of 415  senior notes due august 15 2026 we received net proceeds of 372 million  from the offering and used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce debt incurred as the result of the repayment of cig’s senior notes that matured in 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

on january 26 2016 we announced the issuance of a new 10 billion  term loan facility and the expansion of our revolving credit facility from 40 billion  to 50 billion  the proceeds of the threeyear unsecured term loan facility were used to refinance maturing longterm debt 

in general we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations shortterm borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt to refinance certain of our maturing longterm debt obligations we also expect that our current common stock dividend level will allow us to use retained cash to fund our growth projects in 2017 moreover as a result of our current common stock dividend policy and by continuing to focus on highgrading our growth project backlog to allocate capital to the highest return opportunities we do not expect to need to access the equity capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings however over the long term we are subject to uncertain capital market conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the capital markets we would be required to either continue utilizing internally generated cash restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

as of december 31 2016 our shortterm corporate debt ratings were a3 prime3 and f3 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

 the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2016  



  

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2016  our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i our 50 billion  revolving credit facility and associated 40 billion  commercial paper program and ii cash from operations the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and as previously discussed have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations 

as of december 31 2016  our 2696 million  of shortterm debt consisted primarily of senior notes that mature in 2017 we intend to refinance our shortterm debt through credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings or by issuing new longterm debt or paying down shortterm debt using cash retained from operations or received from asset sales our shortterm debt balance as of december 31 2015  was 821 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 2695 million  and 1241 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively our current liabilities may include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which we may periodically replace with longterm financing andor partially pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 1454 million  117 unfavorable change from yearend 2015  was primarily due to a net increase in our current portion of longterm debt offset partially by a favorable change in cash generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “—longterm financing” and “— capital expenditures” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our wholly owned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to kmi other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock each with a par value of 001 per share in 2015 through an equity distribution agreement we issued and sold through or to our sales agents andor principals shares of our class p common stock for more information on our equity issuances during 2015 and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries have issued longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each 

guarantee the debt of each other see note 19 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 36205 million  and 40732 million  respectively for more information regarding our debtrelated transactions in 2016 see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

to date our debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness for additional information about our debtrelated transactions in 2016  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “results of operations—distributable cash flow” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion  the classification has an impact on dcf because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are see “—common dividends” and “—preferred dividends” 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2016  and the amount we expect to spend for 2017 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

common dividends   

 the table below reflects the payment of cash dividends of 050 per common share for 2016  

the actual amount of common dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “risk factors— the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common stock dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common stock dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november 

preferred dividends   

dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock are payable on a cumulative basis when as and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof at an annual rate of 9750  of the liquidation preference of 1000  per share on january 26 april 26 july 26 and october 26 of each year commencing on january 26 2016 to and including october 26 2018 we may pay dividends in cash or subject to certain limitations in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock 



the cash dividend of 24375  per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is equivalent to 121875  per depository share

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we use include energy products traded on the nymex and otc markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps in addition prior to may 2016 we had power forward and swap contracts related to legacy operations of acquired businesses 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas ngl and crude oil derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value in millions 



 as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the natural gas ngl and crude oil portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt we are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt below are our debt balances and sensitivity to interest rates in millions 



 

 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2016  including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 28  of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency risk 

in connection with the issuance of our euro denominated senior notes in march 2015 we entered into 1358 million  of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixed rate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

we are the largest energy infrastructure company in north america we own an interest in or operate approximately 84000 miles of pipelines and approximately 180 terminals includes 15 terminals acquired in our february 2016 bp products north america inc bp transaction for more information about the acquisition see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements our pipelines transport natural gas refined petroleum products crude oil condensate 

co 2  and other products and our terminals transload and store petroleum products ethanol and chemicals and handle such products as coal petroleum coke and steel we are also the leading producer and transporter of co 2  which is utilized for enhanced oil recovery projects in north america our common stock trades on the nyse under the symbol “kmi” 

a general development of business 

  

organizational structure 

  

on november 26 2014 we completed our acquisition pursuant to three separate merger agreements of all of the outstanding common units of kinder morgan energy partners lp and el paso pipeline partners lp and all of the outstanding shares of kinder morgan management llc that we did not already own the transactions valued at approximately 77 billion are referred to collectively as the “merger transactions” 

as we controlled each of kmp kmr and epb before and continued to control each of them after the merger transactions the changes in our ownership interest in each of kmp kmr and epb were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statements of income related to the merger transactions after closing the kmr merger transaction kmr was merged with and into kmi 

additionally on january 1 2015 epb and its subsidiary eppoc merged with and into kmp as a result of such merger all of the subsidiaries of epb and eppoc became wholly owned subsidiaries of kmp references to epb refer to epb for periods prior to its merger into kmp 

prior to the merger transactions we owned an approximate 10 limited partner interest including our interest in kmr and the 2 general partner interest including incentive distribution rights in kmp and an approximate 39 limited partner interest and the 2 general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in epb effective with the merger transactions the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of kmp were eliminated

recent developments 

the following is a brief listing of significant developments and updates related to our major projects additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report “capital scope” is estimated for our share of the described project which may include portions not yet completed 









financings 

on january 26 2016 we closed on a threeyear unsecured 1 billion term loan and a 1 billion expansion of our unsecured revolving credit facility increasing the capacity of that facility from 4 billion to 5 billion proceeds from the term loan were used to repay existing borrowings and for general corporate purposes pricing and the covenant package of both facilities are consistent with our existing revolving credit facility 

current commodity price environment 

item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” as well as note 4 “impairments and disposals” and note 8 “goodwill” to our consolidated financial statements discuss the impacts of the current commodity price environment on the energy industry including our customers and us refer to the developments addressed in these sections including the resulting noncash impairment charges related to goodwill certain longlived assets and equity method investments for a more general discussion of these related risk factors refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

dividend announcement 

refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —liquidity and capital resources” for a discussion regarding the reduction in our dividend announced in december 2015 to an expected 050 per share on an annualized basis 

2016 outlook 

we expect to declare dividends of 050 per share for 2016 generate approximately 49 billion of distributable cash flow available to equity and approximately 47 billion of distributable cash flow available to common shareholders ie after payment of preferred dividends and generate approximately 36 billion of cash flow in excess of our dividend these expectations assume an average 2016 wti crude oil price of 38 per barrel an average 2016 henry hub natural gas price of 250 per mmbtu and interest rates consistent with the current forward curve at the time that our 2016 budget was prepared 

the overwhelming majority of cash we generate is feebased and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices the primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our co 2  segment where we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil production to minimize this sensitivity for 2016 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately 65 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 06 million and every 1 change in the ratio of the weightedaverage ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 20 million these sensitivities compare to total anticipated segment earnings before dda in 2016 of approximately 8 billion adding back our share of joint venture dda 

we expect that a fullyear of contributions from our 2015 acquisitions and expansions along with partialyear contributions from our anticipated 2016 expansion investments as described above under “—recent developments” will generate incremental earnings and cash flow from our assets in 2016 and beyond generally our base cash flows that is cash flows not attributable to acquisitions or expansions are relatively stable from year to year and are largely supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements 

  in addition our expectations for 2016 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “risk factors” below for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2016 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

b financial information about segments 

for financial information on our six reportable business segments see note 16 “reportable segments” to our consolidated financial statements 

c narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

 

it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances however as discussed under item 1a “risk factors” below there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 

we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions receipt of fairness opinions and approval of our board of directors if applicable while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations 

business segments 

we operate the following reportable business segments these segments and their principal sources of revenues are as follows 

 11 

 

natural gas pipelines 

our natural gas pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our lng terminals and includes both ferc regulated and nonferc regulated assets 

our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales transportation storage gathering processing and treating and the terminaling of lng within this segment are i approximately 52000 miles of natural gas pipelines and ii our equity interests in entities that have approximately 19000 miles of natural gas pipelines along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western us louisiana texas the midwest northeast rocky mountain midwest and southeastern regions our lng storage and regasification terminals also serve natural gas supply areas in the southeast the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines segment assets as of december 31 2015  the design capacity represents either transmission gathering or liquefaction capacity depending on the nature of the asset 







competition 

the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines and their shippers for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service from time to time other projects are proposed that would compete with us we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including electricity coal propane and fuel oils several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

co 2   

our co 2  business segment produces transports and markets co 2  for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2  pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co 2  supply transportation and technical expertise to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

oil and gas producing activities 

oil producing interests 

our ownership interests in oilproducing fields located in the permian basin of west texas include the following 



 

 

the following table sets forth productive wells service wells and drilling wells in the oil and gas fields in which we owned interests as of december 31 2015  the oil and gas producing fields in which we own interests are located in the permian basin area of west texas when used with respect to acres or wells “gross” refers to the total acres or wells in which we have a working interest and “net” refers to gross acres or wells multiplied in each case by the percentage working interest owned by us 



 

 

the following table reflects our net productive wells that were completed in each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 



 

note the above table includes wells that were completed during each year regardless of the year in which drilling was initiated and does not include any wells where drilling operations were not completed as of the end of the applicable year a development well is a well drilled in an already discovered oil field 

  

the following table reflects the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage that we held as of december 31 2015 



 

note as of december 31 2015 we have no material amount of acreage expiring in the next three years 

see “supplemental information on oil and gas activities unaudited” for additional information with respect to operating statistics and supplemental information on our oil and gas producing activities 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas 



 

 

sales and transportation activities 

co 2  segment storage and sales 

our principal market for co 2  is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years our ownership of co 2  resources as of december 31 2015 includes 



 

 

co 2  segment pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2  pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2  for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years the tariffs charged on the wink pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission and the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline’s tariffs are regulated by the texas railroad commission the tariff charged on the cortez pipeline is based on a consent decree and the tariffs charged by our other co 2  pipelines are not regulated 

our ownership of co 2  and crude oil pipelines as of december 31 2015 includes 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2  include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2  resources and oxy usa inc which controls waste co 2  extracted from natural gas production in the val verde basin of west texas our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other co 2  pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2  to the denver city texas market area 

terminals 

our terminals segment includes the operations of our petroleum chemical ethanol and other liquids terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines segment and all of our coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk material services facilities including all transload engineering conveying and other inplant services our terminals are located throughout the us and in portions of canada we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition we have jones act qualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us the following summarizes our terminals segment assets as of december 31 2015  



 

 

competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the us based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals 

owned by oil chemical and pipeline companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services in some locations competitors are smaller independent operators with lower cost structures our jones act qualified product tankers compete with other jones act qualified vessel fleets 

products pipelines 

 our products pipelines segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate and ngl pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes our significant products pipelines segment assets we own and operate as of december 31 2015  



 

 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products and railcars our products pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

kinder morgan canada 

our kinder morgan canada business segment includes our 100 owned and operated trans mountain pipeline system and a 25mile jet fuel pipeline system 

trans mountain pipeline system 

the trans mountain pipeline system originates at edmonton alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of british columbia the trans mountain pipeline is 713 miles in length we also own and operate a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of washington the capacity of the line at edmonton ranges from 300 mbbld when heavy crude oil represents 20 of the total throughput which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage to 400 mbbld with no heavy crude oil 

jet fuel pipeline system 

we also own and operate the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl 

competition 

trans mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and it competes against other pipeline providers however it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast furthermore as demonstrated by our previously announced expansion proposal discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—kinder morgan canada” we believe that the trans mountain pipeline facilities provide us the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop 

in december 2013 the british columbia ministry of environment granted approval for a new airport fuel consortium owned jet fuel terminal to be located near the vancouver international airport the impact of this facility on our existing jet fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time 

other 

during 2015  our other segment activity primarily includes other miscellaneous assets and liabilities including i our corporate headquarters in houston texas ii several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with legacy trading activities and iii other miscellaneous legacy assets and liabilities 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations includes the operations of kinder morgan tejas pipeline llc kinder morgan border pipeline llc kinder morgan texas pipeline llc kinder morgan north texas pipeline llc and the miermonterrey mexico pipeline system buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2  business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2  business segments in 2015 2014 and 2013 accounted for 20 25 and 28 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness 

of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

on october 24 1992 congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service our subsidiary trans mountain pipeline lp is the sole owner of our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 

the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc for further information see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” above 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay but while the rates may vary by shipper and circumstance pipelines must generally use the form of service agreement that is contained within their ferc approved tariff any deviation from the pro forma  service agreements must be filed with the ferc and only certain types of deviations are acceptable to the ferc 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 20 

pipeline business practices and electronic communications that were developed and adopted by the north american energy standards board naesb interstate natural gas pipelines are required to incorporate by reference or verbatim in their respective tariffs the applicable version of the naesb standards 

 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc as is more fully described in note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

railroad commission of texas rct rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the rct the rct has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulatory commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulating commission the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2026 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitations i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical 

studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which was signed into law in 2012 increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the advisory bulletin requirements could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may precipitate claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation 

we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreign flagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the us secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 284 million as of december 31 2015 our reserve estimates range in value from approximately 284 million   to approximately 457 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

epa revisions to ozone national ambient air quality standard naaqs 

as required by the clean air act epa establishes national ambient air quality standards naaqs for how much pollution is permissible and then the states have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the naaqs in october 2015 epa published a rule lowering the ground level ozone naaqs from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard this change triggers a process under which epa will designate the areas of the country that are in or out of attainment with the new naaqs standard then certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the naaqs standard these new state rules which are expected in 2020 or 2021 will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly installed equipment and possibly require retrofitting existing km facilities with air pollution controls given the nationwide implications of the new rule it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each kinder morgan business unit 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control 

greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co 2  and methane our facilities are subject to these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements additionally in september 2015 the epa published a proposed rule regarding the “oil and natural gas sector emission standards for new and modified sources” otherwise known as the proposed new source performance standard nsps part ooooa rule if finalized this rule would be the first federal rule under the clean air act to regulate methane as a pollutant and would impose additional pollution control and work practice requirements on applicable kinder morgan facilities 

on october 23 2015 the epa published as a final rule the clean power plan which sets interim and final co2 emission performance rates for power generating units that fire coal oil or natural gas the final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the us congress and litigation in federal court on february 10 2016 the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved the ultimate resolution of the final rule’s validity remains uncertain while we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the clean power plan final rule it remains unclear what effect the final rule if it comes into force might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas including natural gas that we gather process store and transport 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa depending on the particular program we could be required to conduct monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives such as the proposed clean power plan could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2  business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees   

we employed 11290 fulltime people at december 31 2015  including approximately 787 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2016 and 2018 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to operating our business 

our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities that we handle 

our pipelines terminals and other assets and facilities depend in part on continued production of natural gas oil and other products in the geographic areas that they serve our business also depends in part on the levels of demand for oil natural gas coal steel chemicals and other products in the geographic areas to which our pipelines terminals shipping vessels and other facilities deliver or provide service and the ability and willingness of our shippers and other customers to supply such demand 

without additions to oil and gas reserves production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our pipelines and related facilities may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as the sharp decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices supply disruptions or higher development costs could result in a slowing of supply to our pipelines terminals and other assets in addition changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil natural gas coal and other products each of these factors impacts our customers shipping through our pipelines or using our terminals which in turn could impact the prospects of new contracts for transportation terminaling or other midstream services or renewals of existing contracts 

implementation of new regulations or changes to existing regulations affecting the energy industry could reduce production of andor demand for natural gas crude oil refined petroleum products coal and other hydrocarbons increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the production of andor demand for natural gas crude oil refined petroleum products and other hydrocarbons 

financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us 

we are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers or other counterparties such as hedging counterparties joint venture partners and suppliers some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating market and regulatory risks and some are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 

in 2015 several of our counterparties defaulted on their obligations to us and some have filed for bankruptcy protection we cannot provide any assurance that other financially distressed counterparties will not also default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy protection if a counterparty files for bankruptcy protection we likely would be unable to collect all or even a significant portion of amounts that they owe to us additional counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows furthermore in the case of 

financially distressed customers such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry the coal industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity might also have a negative impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us see “financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us” in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil ngl and natural gas will have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow see “the volatility of oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our co2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipeline and products pipelines business segments” 

if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and new build projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway public opposition cost overruns inclement weather and other delays 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets a variety of factors outside of our control such as difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals that can be exacerbated by public opposition to our projects have caused and may continue to cause delays in our ability to begin construction projects inclement weather natural disasters and delays in performance by thirdparty contractors have resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows and could result in project cancellations or limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 

additionally we must obtain and maintain the rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land if we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines our business could be negatively affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners primarily through rental increases and renewals of expired agreements whether we have the power of eminent domain for our pipelines other than interstate natural gas pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipelinepetroleum liquids natural gas co2 or crude oiland the laws of the particular state our interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority in either case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court our inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect our business if we were to lose the right to use or occupy any of the properties on which our pipelines are located 

the acquisition of additional businesses and assets is part of our growth strategy we may experience difficulties integrat ing new properties and businesses and we may be unable to achieve the benefits we expect from any future acquisitions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses and assets if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings integration of acquired companies or assets involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in our size ii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting estimating reporting and other systems and iv difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

we face competition from other pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil petroleum products or natural gas into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us 

commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to transportation and storage of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products co2 coal chemicals and other products such as leaks releases explosions mechanical problems and damage caused by third parties additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions capsizing grounding and navigation errors these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and cash flows while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the volatility of oil ngl and natural gas prices could adversely affect our co2 business segment and businesses within our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments 

the revenues cash flows profitability and future growth of some of our businesses depend to a large degree on prevailing oil natural gas and ngl prices our co2 business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas producing properties and certain midstream businesses within our natural gas pipelines segment depend to a large degree and certain businesses within our product pipelines segment depend to a lesser degree on prevailing oil ngl and natural gas prices for 2016 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately 65 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 06 million and every 1 change in the ratio of the weightedaverage ngl price per barrel to the wti crude oil price per barrel impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 20 million 

prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political instability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources we use hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices but these arrangements also are subject to inherent risks please read “ our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income” 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas or a prolonged unfavorable price environment would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from our businesses that produce process or purchase and sell oil ngl or natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our co2 business segment’s proved reserves if prices fall substantially or remain low for a sustained period and we are not sufficiently protected through hedging arrangements we may be unable to realize a profit from these businesses and would operate at a loss 

in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively 

short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk” 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves revenues and cash flows of the oil and gas producing assets within our co2 business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

our use of hedging arrangements does not eliminate our exposure to commodity price risks and could result in financial losses or volatility in our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil ngl and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the markets for instruments we use to hedge our commodity price exposure generally reflect thenprevailing conditions in the underlying commodity markets as our existing hedges expire we will seek to replace them with new hedging arrangements to the extent underlying market conditions are unfavorable new hedging arrangements available to us will reflect such unfavorable conditions 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that eliminate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting policies and estimateshedging activities” and note 13 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events or the threat of them may adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other infrastructure assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems terminals processing plants or operating systems a cyber security event could affect our ability to operate or control our facilities or disrupt our operations also customer information could be stolen the occurrence of one of these events could 

cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to our reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate cyber sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in and our shipping vessels operate in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and the loss of such workforce could result in the failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our executive chairman or executive officers our ability to execute our business strategy including our growth strategy may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive chairman and our executive officers particularly richard d kinder our executive chairman and one of our founders and steve kean our president and chief executive officer along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder and mr kean have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

our kinder morgan canada and terminals segments are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada business segments a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues cash flows and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

risks related to financing our business 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 41 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally we and substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries are parties to a cross guarantee agreement under which each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party which means that we are liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of consolidated debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our consolidated debt will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our consolidated cash flow is not sufficient to service our consolidated debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions such as reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to the cross guarantee could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital limiting our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities and reducing our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities 

also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our acquisition strategy and growth capital expenditures may require access to external capital limitations on our access to external financing sources could impair our ability to grow 

we have limited amounts of internally generated cash flows to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures we may have to rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures limitations on our access to external financing sources whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 11 billion of our approximately 41 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm variablerate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

risks related to ownership of our capital stock 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere the expected cash dividends on our common stock and on our preferred stock or depositary shares this reflects our current judgment but as with any estimate it may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and known and unknown risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “information regarding forwardlooking statements” if the payment of dividends at the anticipated levels would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely 

advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business would be harmed 

conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated levels as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends might have to choose between addressing those matters and reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends our board of directors may choose to cause us to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed below under “risks related to financing our businessour substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic consequences” 

our certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership of our common stock by nonus citizens within the meaning of the jones act these restrictions may affect the liquidity of our common stock and may result in nonus citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss 

the jones act requires among other things that at least 75 of our common stock be owned at all times by us citizens as defined under the jones act in order for us to own and operate vessels in the us coastwise trade as a safeguard to help us maintain our status as a us citizen our certificate of incorporation provides that if the number of shares of our common stock owned by nonus citizens exceeds 22 we have the ability to redeem shares owned by nonus citizens to reduce the percentage of shares owned by nonus citizens to 22 these redemption provisions may adversely impact the marketability of our common stock particularly in markets outside of the united states further stockholders would not have control over the timing of such redemption and may be subject to redemption at a time when the market price or timing of the redemption is disadvantageous in addition the redemption provisions might have the effect of impeding or discouraging a merger tender offer or proxy contest by a nonus citizen even if it were favorable to the interests of some or all of our stockholders 

risks related to regulation 

new regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes in regulations by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state provincial and local regulatory authorities regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service ii the types of services we may offer to our customers iii the contracts for service entered into with our customers iv the certification and construction of new facilities v the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vi the acquisition of other businesses vii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities viii reporting and information posting requirements ix the maintenance of accounts and records and x relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines and potential loss of government contracts furthermore new laws or regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessregulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in 

question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state or provincial laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines shipping vessels or storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we believe we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental matters” 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines issued by the dot for pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause 

us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us and could reduce demand for our products and services 

various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane and co2 including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs existing epa regulations require us to report greenhouse gas emissions in the us from sources such as our larger natural gas compressor stations fractionated ngl and production of naturally occurring co2 for example from our mcelmo dome co2 field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere proposed approaches to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions include establishing greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for pollution reduction use of renewable energy sources or use of alternative fuels with lower carbon content for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change” 

adoption of any such laws or regulations could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc such laws or regulations could also lead to reduced demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to greenhouse gases or restrictions on their use which in turn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 

finally some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events which may lead to higher insurance costs or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions 

any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

we gather process or transport crude oil natural gas or ngl from several areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of crude oil natural gas or ngl and in turn adversely affect our revenues cash flows and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of these commodities that we handle 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations 

regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

derivatives regulation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the cftc has proposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided the doddfrank act related regulations and the reduction in competition due to derivatives industry consolidation have i significantly increased the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduced the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduced the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our us point to point maritime shipping vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or a repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade result in the forfeiture of our vessels or otherwise adversely impact our earnings cash flows and operations 

we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and manned by predominately us crews our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal objectives 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

 

   

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us and canadian energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines related storage facilities and lng terminals the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline operations currently derives approximately 73 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2015  the remaining average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ purchase and sales contracts was approximately   six years 

our midstream assets provide gathering and processing services for natural gas and gathering services for crude oil these assets are generally feebased and the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems such volumes are impacted by producer rig count and drilling activity in addition to fee based arrangements we also provide some services based on percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts some of which may include minimum volume requirements our service contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

the co 2  source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2015 had a remaining average contract life of approximately   nine years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2016 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2016 budget approximately 99 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 1 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2  business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2  business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil ngl and co 2  sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was 7311 per barrel in 2015 8841 per barrel in 2014 and 9270 per barrel in 2013 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 4756 per barrel in 2015 8648 per barrel in 2014 and 9494 per barrel in 2013 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of 

the length of the underlying service contracts   which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that contain minimum volume guarantees andor service exclusivity arrangements under which customers are required to utilize our terminals for all or a specified percentage of their handling and storage needs the profitability of our minimum volume contracts is generally unaffected by shortterm variation in economic conditions however to the extent we expect volumes above the minimum andor have contracts which are volumebased we can be sensitive to changing market conditions to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods our eight jones act qualified tankers operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are currently operating pursuant to multiyear charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation and storage business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services we also have approximately 55 liquids terminals in this business segment that store fuels and offer blending services for ethanol and biofuels the transportation and storage volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

our crude and condensate transportation services are primarily provided either pursuant to i longterm contracts that normally contain minimum volume commitments or ii through terms prescribed by the toll settlements with shippers and approved by regulatory authorities as a result of these contracts our settlement volumes are generally not sensitive to changing market conditions in the shorter term however in the longer term the revenues and earnings we realize from our crude and condensate pipelines in the us and canada are affected by the volumes of crude and condensate available to our pipeline systems which are impacted by the level of oil and gas drilling activity in the respective producing regions that we serve our petroleum condensate processing facility splits condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphtha under a longterm feebased agreement with a major integrated oil company 

a portion of our business portfolio including the kinder morgan canada business segment the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline and the bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada transact in andor use the canadian dollar as the functional currency which affect segment results due to the variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

  

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

acquisition method of accounting   

for acquired businesses we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 17 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization 

and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year at year end and during other interim periods we evaluate our reporting units for events and changes that could indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

for more information on our december 31 2015 goodwill impairment evaluation and amortizable intangibles see note 8 “goodwill” to our consolidated financial statements 

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves please see “supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities unaudited” 

dda expense on our proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production uop method the reserves that are used to determine the uop depletion rate for leasehold acquisition and the costs to acquire proved properties is the total of our developed and undeveloped proved reserves which are known as total proved reserves the uop depreciation rate for our tangible lease and well equipment costs including development costs and exploration costs associated with successful drilling projects is calculated based upon total proved developed reserves our estimated future well plugging and abandonment costs along with future expected salvage values are considered in the uop dda expense calculation for our oil and gas producing properties that have no proved reserves the uop depreciation rate is based on each property’s riskadjusted probable reserves and nymex forward curve prices 

the sustained deterioration in the longterm outlook for commodity prices was a triggering event that required us to perform impairment testing of our assets that are sensitive to such commodity prices during 2015 we performed a twostep impairment testing of certain longlived assets within our co2 segment which resulted in the impairment of certain of our oil and gas producing properties in the amount of 399 million for the year ended december 31 2015 

as of december 31 2015 the net book value of productive properties plant and equipment associated with our oil and gas proved reserves was approximately 932 million which included 495 million barrels of oil equivalent of estimated proved developed reserves and the dda expense recorded on these properties in 2015 was 376 million if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unitofproduction calculation had been lower by 5 dda expense in 2015 would have increased by approximately 15 million 

continued lower commodity prices as indicated by forward curve pricing that is used in testing for impairment estimated total proved and riskadjusted probable oil and gas reserves and related expected future cash flows may result in additional impairments of our oil producing interests and increased dda expense in 2016 see note 4 “impairments and disposals” to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging activities 

  

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately we may or may not apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts depending on the circumstances all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value for more information on our hedging activities see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2015  our pension plans were underfunded by   604 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by   184 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations for 2015 we selected our discount rates by matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to the average yields of various highquality bonds with corresponding maturities the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 10 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2016 we changed our estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost credit for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans the new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the new estimate provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change does not affect the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and it is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively the change in the service and interest costs going forward will not be significant 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants as of december 31 2015  we had deferred net losses of approximately 535 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2015  

 

 

income taxes 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

  

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments 

results of operations 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap financial measures dcf before certain items and segment ebda before certain items are presented below under “—distributable cash flow” and   “—consolidated earnings results” respectively    certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either do not have a cash impact or by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically 

our nongaap measures described below should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income or any other gaap measure dcf before certain items and segment ebda before certain items are not financial measures in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider either of these nongaap measures in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap because dcf before certain items excludes some but not all items that affect net income and because dcf measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry our dcf before certain items may not be comparable to dcf measures of other companies our computation of segment ebda before certain items has similar limitations management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

distributable cash flow 

  

dcf before certain items is an overall performance metric we use to estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash flows on an ongoing basis and as a measure of cash available to pay dividends we believe the primary measure of company performance used by us investors and industry analysts is cash generation performance therefore we believe dcf before certain items is an important measure to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare it with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry 

the table below details the reconciliation of net income to dcf before certain items

consolidated earnings results 

in the results of operations table below and in the business segment tables that follow segment ebda before certain items is calculated by adjusting the segment earnings before dda for the applicable certain item amounts in the footnotes to those tables 

in general interest expense general and administrative expenses dda unallocable interest income and income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests are not controllable by our business segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

we evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment ebda before certain items in relation to the level of capital allocated and consider this to be an important measure of our business segment performance we account for intersegment sales at market prices which are eliminated in consolidation

certain item footnotes 

 

year ended december 31 2015 vs 2014 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c and d to the tables above accounted for 1767 million of the decrease in income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 representing the difference between decreases of 1781 million and 14 million in total income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes for 2015 and 2014 respectively after giving effect to these certain items the remaining decrease of 550 million 18 from the prior year in income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes is primarily attributable to increased dda expense general and administrative expense and interest expense net of unallocable interest income as explained further below our total segment earnings before dda did not change significantly when compared to the prior year as unfavorable commodity prices affecting our co 2  business segment were offset by increased results from our products pipelines terminals and natural gas pipelines business segments 

year ended december 31 2014 vs 2013 

the certain item totals reflected in footnotes b c and d to the tables above accounted for 627 million of the decrease in income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes in 2014 when compared to 2013 combining a decrease of 14 million and an increase of 613 million in total income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes for 2014 and 2013 respectively after giving effect to these certain items the remaining increase of 266 million 10 from the prior year in income from continuing operations before unallocable income taxes relates to better overall performance primarily from our natural gas pipelines products pipelines and terminals segments in 2014

for the comparable years of 2015 and 2014 the kinder morgan canada business segment had a decrease in earnings of 19 million 10 which was driven primarily by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and repayment of the express note as discussed in footnote a above

for the comparable years of 2014 and 2013 the trans mountain pipeline had a decrease in earnings of 12 million 6 which was driven primarily by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates due to the weakening of the canadian dollar since the end of the third quarter of 2013 we translated canadian denominated income and expense amounts into fewer us dollars in 2014

 other footnote 

 

the increase in general and administrative expenses before certain items of 26 million and 17 million in 2015 and 2014 when compared with the respective prior year was primarily driven by the acquisition of hiland effective february 13 2015 and copano effective may 1 2013 additional drivers for the increase between 2015 and 2014 were lower capitalized costs and higher labor expenses partially offset by lower benefit and insurance costs while the increase between 2014 and 2013 was impacted by higher benefit costs payroll taxes and labor expenses partially offset by lower costs on our corporate headquarters building and insurance costs 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income and other net before certain items increased 272 million and 90 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively when compared with the respective prior year the increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher average debt balances as a result of capital expenditures joint venture contributions and acquisitions that were made during 2014 and 2015 and incremental debt borrowings to fund the 39 billion cash portion of the merger transactions in november 2014 

the increase in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher average debt balances as a result of capital expenditures joint venture contributions and acquisitions that were made during 2014 and incremental debt borrowings to fund the 39 billion cash portion of the merger transactions in november 2014 in addition the increase was impacted by the refinancing of the shortterm kmi credit facility debt with a 15 billion longterm debt issuance in november 2013 which had a higher interest rate this increase in interest expense was partially offset by i lower average balances outstanding on our ep acquisition term loan as a result of its termination in november 2014 and ii lower interest rates on our credit facility and ep acquisition term loan as a result of the refinancing of these facilities in 2014  

  

we use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  approximately 27 and 26 respectively of our debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rateseither as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 14 “risk management— interest rate risk management ” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us the 1399 million decrease 99for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to our purchase of the kmp and epb limited partner units and kmr shares formerly owned by the public in the fourth quarter of 2014 as part of the merger transactions the 82 million decrease 5 for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to our noncontrolling interests’ portion of i our 2013 558 million pretax gain from the remeasurement of our previously held 50 equity interest in eagle ford to fair value and ii our 2013 140 million aftertax gain on the sale of our investments in the express pipeline system which was partially offset by our noncontrolling interests’ portion of our 2014 198 million pretax increase associated with the early termination of a longterm natural gas transportation contract by a certain customer of kmlp and an increase in income allocated to noncontolling interests during the fourth quarter 2014 due to the elimination of the incentive distribution rights as a result of the merger transactions 

subsequent to the merger transactions net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents net income allocated to thirdparty ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger transactions it also included net income allocated to kmp and epb limited partner units formerly owned by the public 

income taxes—continuing operations 

  

year ended december 31 2015 versus year ended december 31 2014 

our income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015 was 564 million as compared with 2014 income tax expense of 648 million the 84 million decrease in income tax expense is due primarily to i the tax impact of lower pretax earnings in 2015 primarily due to our recognition of 929 million of impairments on longlived assets and investments and 1150 million goodwill impairment of natural gas pipelines nonregulated midstream assets of which 882 million is not tax deductible ii the tax benefit of an increase in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the hiland acquisition iii the 2014 recording of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl and iv the elimination as a result of the merger transactions of the amortization of the deferred charge recorded as a result of the dropdowns of tgp epng and the midstream assets these decreases are partially offset by the 2014 benefit of a worthless stock deduction related to our brazil operations 

year ended december 31 2014 versus year ended december 31 2013 

our income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2014 was   648 million as compared with 2013 income tax expense of 742 million   the   94 million decrease in income tax expense is due primarily to i the tax impact of lower pretax earnings in 2014 associated with our investment in kmp primarily related to kmp’s 2014 recognition of a 235 million impairment of co 2  assets compared to gains recognized in 2013 of 558 million on remeasurement to fair value of the initial 50 interest in the eagle ford joint venture and 224 million on the sale of the onethird interest in the express pipeline system ii a 2014 worthless stock deduction related to our brazil operations and iii a 2013 decrease in our share of nontaxdeductible goodwill associated with our investment in kmp as a result of our change in ownership primarily due to kmp’s acquisition of copano these decreases are partially offset by i the tax benefit in 2013 of a decrease in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the dropdown of our 50 ownership interest in epng and midstream assets and kmp’s acquisition of copano ii 2013 adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of legacy ep internal revenue service audits and iii the 2014 recording of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had 229 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” on our consolidated balance sheet a decrease of 86 million   27  from december 31 2014  we believe our cash position remaining borrowing capacity on our credit facility discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and our cash flows from operating activities are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations as discussed further below 

we have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 5303 million  and 4467 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the yeartoyear increase of 19  is discussed below in “cash flows—operating activities” during 2015 we have relied on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt service sustaining capital expenditures and dividend payments 

historically we have relied on cash from our equity and debt issuances to fund in large part expansion capital expenditures acquisitions and to refinance debt maturities however due to the recent unfavorable capital market conditions the resulting increased cost of equity and debt issuances have made it less economical to do so as a result on december 8 2015 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan pursuant to which we expect to pay quarterly dividends of 0125 per share to our common shareholders 050 per common share annually down from our third quarter 2015 dividend of 051 per common share beginning with the fourth quarter 2015 dividend payable to common shareholders on february 16 2016 we expect the reduced dividend level eliminates our need to access the capital markets to fund our growth projects in 2016 

additionally on january 26 2016 we announced the issuance of a new 1 billion term loan facility and the expansion of our revolving credit facility from 4 billion to 5 billion the proceeds of the threeyear unsecured term loan were used to refinance maturing longterm debt 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

based on our recent decision to retain a larger portion of our internally generated cash to fund our growth projects we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through retained cash from operations or shortterm borrowings however over the long term we are subject to uncertain capital market conditions and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the capital markets we would be required to either further utilize internally generated cash restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

our shortterm corporate debt rating is a3 prime3 and f3 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

 the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2015  



  

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2015  our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i our 40 billion  revolving credit facility which capacity was increased to 50 billion on january 26 2016 and associated 40 billion  commercial paper program and ii cash from operations the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes and as a backup to our commercial paper program borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and as previously discussed have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations 

our shortterm debt as of december 31 2015  was 821 million  comprised entirely of the current portion of our longterm debt excluding 10 billion of debt that matured in january and february 2016 that was refinanced using proceeds from the 10 billion term loan issued in january 2016 and therefore included within “longterm debt” on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 we intend to refinance our shortterm debt through additional credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings or with issuing new longterm debt or paying down shortterm debt using cash retained from operations our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2014  was 2717 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 1241 million  and 2610 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively our current liabilities include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which periodically we may replace with longterm financing andor partially pay down using retained cash from operations the overall 1369 million  52 favorable change from yearend 2014  was primarily due to a net decrease in our credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings and current portion of longterm debt largely refinanced with the new longterm issuances offset partially by i lower other current assets driven by the 2015 receipt of a federal tax refund and ii lower cash balances generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of excess cash from operations after payments for investing and financing activities discussed below in “—longterm financing” and “— capital expenditures” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our subsidiaries their operating partnerships and their whollyowned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our subsidiaries their operating partnerships and their whollyowned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

our equity consists of class p common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock each with a par value of 001 per share in 2015 through an equity distribution agreement we issued and sold through or to our sales agents andor principals shares of our class p common stock for more information on our equity issuances during 2015  and our equity distribution agreement see note 11 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium in addition from time to time our subsidiaries have issued longterm debt securities furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee the debt of each other see note 19 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our various longterm debt obligations excluding current maturities was 40732 million  and 38312 million  respectively 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

to date our and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness for additional information about our debtrelated transactions in 2015  see note 9 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “results of operations—distributable cash flow” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion  the classification has an impact on cash available to pay dividends because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are see “—common dividends” and “—preferred dividends” 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2015  and the amount we expect to spend for 2016 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

common dividends   

 the table below reflects the payment of cash dividends of 1605 per common share for 2015  

as disclosed elsewhere in this report we expect to pay cash dividends totaling 050 per share on our common stock for 2016 the actual amount of common dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “risk factors— the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our common dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our common dividends generally will be paid on or about the 16th day of each february may august and november 

preferred dividends   

dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock are payable on a cumulative basis when as and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof at an annual rate of 9750  of the liquidation preference of 1000  per share on january 26 april 26 july 26 and october 26 of each year commencing on january 26 2016 to and including october 26 2018 we may pay dividends in cash or subject to certain limitations in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock the terms of the mandatory convertible preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock 

on november 17 2015 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 23291667  per share of our mandatory convertible preferred stock equivalent of 1164583  per depository share for the period from and including october 30 2015 through and including january 25 2016 was paid on january 26 2016 to mandatory convertible preferred shareholders of record as of january 11 2016

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we manage these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we use include energy products traded on the nymex and otc markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps in addition we have power forward and swap contracts related to legacy operations of acquired businesses for which we entered into positions that offset the price risks associated with these contracts 

our hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position or anticipated position in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas ngl crude oil and power derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values as of december 31 2015  and 2014  a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity natural gas prices would affect the estimated fair value of natural gas derivatives by 13 million  and 9 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  and 2014  a hypothetical 10 movement in 

underlying commodity crude oil prices would affect the estimated fair value of crude oil derivative by 97 million  and 146 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  and 2014  a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity ngl prices would affect the estimated fair value of our ngl derivatives by 4 million  and 03 million  respectively as of both december 31 2015  and 2014  a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity electricity prices would not affect the estimated fair value of our power derivatives as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the natural gas ngl crude oil and power portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 

  

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the carrying values of the fixed rate debt were 43039 million  and 41390 million  respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2015  and 2014  fair values of 37329 million  and 42343 million  respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2015  and 2014  would result in changes of approximately 1667 million  and 1539 million  respectively in the fair values of these instruments 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the carrying values of our variable rate debt were 188 million  and 1424 million  respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2015 and 2014 fair values of 152 million  and 1418 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we were party to fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 11000 million and 9200 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 49 basis points  in 2015  and approximately 50 basis points  in 2014  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2015  and 2014  including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 55 million  and 53 million  respectively in our 2015  and 2014  annual pretax earnings 

fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

  

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2015  including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments approximately 27  of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates 

for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 14 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency risk 

in connection with the issuance of our euro denominated senior notes in march 2015 we entered into 1358 million of crosscurrency swap agreements that effectively convert all of the fixedrate euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to us dollar denominated debt at fixed rates these swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

we are the largest energy infrastructure and the third largest energy company in north america with an enterprise value of more than   125 billion we own an interest in or operate approximately 80000 miles of pipelines and 180 terminals our pipelines transport natural gas refined petroleum products crude oil condensate co 2  and other products and our terminals transload and store petroleum products ethanol and chemicals and handle such products as coal petroleum coke and steel we are also the leading producer and transporter of co 2  which is utilized for enhanced oil recovery projects in north america our common stock trades on the nyse under the symbol “kmi” 

a general development of business 

  

organizational structure 

  

on november 26 2014 we completed our acquisition pursuant to three separate merger agreements of all of the outstanding common units of kinder morgan energy partners lp nyse kmp and el paso pipeline partners lp nyse epb and all of the outstanding shares of kinder morgan management llc nyse kmr that we did not already own the transactions valued at approximately 77 billion are referred to collectively as the “merger transactions” 

upon completion of the merger transactions i each publicly held kmr share received 24849 shares of kmi common stock ii through the election and proration mechanisms in the kmp merger agreement on average each common unit held by a public kmp unitholder received 21931 shares of kmi common stock and 1077 in cash and iii through the election and proration mechanisms in the epb merger agreement on average each common unit held by a public epb unitholder received 09451 shares of kmi common stock and 465 in cash the cash payments to the public unitholders of kmp and epb totaled approximately 39 billion 

as we controlled each of kmp kmr and epb and continued to control each of them after the merger transactions the changes in our ownership interest in each of kmp kmr and epb were accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statements of income resulting from the merger transactions after closing the kmr merger transaction kmr was merged with and into kmi 

additionally on january 1 2015 epb and its subsidiary eppoc merged with and into kmp and were dissolved as a result of such merger all of the subsidiaries of epb and eppoc are wholly owned subsidiaries of kmp 

prior to november 26 2014 we owned an approximate 10 limited partner interest including our interest in kmr and the 2 general partner interest including incentive distribution rights in kmp and an approximate 39 limited partner interest and the 2 general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in epb effective with the merger transactions the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of kmp was eliminated 

historically most of our operating assets were owned and most of our investments were conducted by kmp and epb 

the equity interests in kmp epb and kmr which are all consolidated in our financial statements owned by the public prior to november 26 2014 are reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet the earnings recorded by kmp epb and kmr that are attributed to their units and shares respectively held by the public prior to november 26 2014 are reported as “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying consolidated statements of income 

you should read the following in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements under gaap and the rules and regulations of the sec our accounting records are maintained in us dollars and all references to dollars in this report are to us dollars except where stated otherwise our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned andor controlled subsidiaries and all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation the address of our principal executive offices is 1001 louisiana street suite 1000 houston texas 77002 and our telephone number at this address is 713 3699000

financings 

 

2015 outlook 

 we expect that a fullyear of contributions from our 2014 acquisitions and expansions including cash tax benefits from the merger transactions along with partialyear contributions from our anticipated 2015 expansion investments as described above under — recent developments  will help drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2015 and beyond generally our base cash flows that is cash flows not attributable to acquisitions or expansions are relatively stable from year to year and are largely supported by multiyear feebased customer arrangements 

the overwhelming majority of cash generated by our assets is feebased and is not sensitive to commodity prices we do have some commodity price sensitivity primarily in our co 2 segment and hedge the majority of our next twelve months of oil production to minimize this sensitivity for 2015 we estimate that every 1 per barrel change in average wti crude oil price impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 10 million budget assumes average wti price of 70 per barrel and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 3 million budget assumes average natural gas price of 380 per mmbtu this assumes we do not add additional hedges during the year which could reduce these sensitivities these sensitivities compare to total anticipated segment earnings before dda in 2015 of approximately 8 billion adding back our share of joint venture dda 

in addition our expectations for 2015 discussed above involve risks uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict and because of these uncertainties it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement please read our item 1a “risk factors” below for more information furthermore we plan to provide updates to our 2015 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis 

b financial information about segments 

for financial information on our six reportable business segments see note 15 “reportable segments” to our consolidated financial statements 

c narrative description of business 

business strategy 

our business strategy is to 

 

it is our intention to carry out the above business strategy modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances however as discussed under item 1a “risk factors” below there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 

we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions receipt of fairness opinions and approval of our board of directors if applicable while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations 

business segments 

we operate the following reportable business segments these segments and their principal sources of revenues are as follows 

 

natural gas pipelines 

our natural gas pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our lng terminals and includes both ferc regulated and nonferc regulated assets 

our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales transportation storage gathering processing and treating and the terminaling of lng within this segment are i approximately 48000 miles of natural gas pipelines and ii our equity interests in entities that have approximately 19000 miles of natural gas pipelines along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks which are strategically located throughout the north american natural gas pipeline grid our transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas and consumers in the western us louisiana texas the midwest northeast rocky mountain midwest and southeastern regions our lng storage and regasification terminals also serve natural gas supply areas in the southeast the following tables summarize our significant natural gas pipelines segment assets as of december 31 2014 the design capacity represents either transmission or gathering capacity depending on the nature of the asset 





 

competition 

the market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines storage facilities treating facilities and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our natural gas pipelines business segment these operations compete with interstate and intrastate 

pipelines and their shippers for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services we believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service from time to time other projects are proposed that would compete with us we do not know whether or when any such projects would be built or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability 

shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users including electricity coal propane and fuel oils several factors influence the demand for natural gas including price changes the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy the level of business activity conservation legislation and governmental regulations the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather 

co 2   

our co 2  business segment produces transports and markets co 2  for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields our co 2  pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of co 2  supply transportation and technical expertise to our customers we also hold ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and own a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

oil and gas producing activities 

oil producing interests 

our ownership interests in oilproducing fields located in the permian basin of west texas include the following 



 

 

the following table sets forth productive wells service wells and drilling wells in the oil and gas fields in which we owned interests as of december 31 2014 the oil and gas producing fields in which we own interests are located in the permian basin area of west texas when used with respect to acres or wells “gross” refers to the total acres or wells in which we have a working interest and “net” refers to gross acres or wells multiplied in each case by the percentage working interest owned by us 



 

 15 

the following table reflects our net productive wells that were completed in each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 



 

note the above table includes wells that were completed during each year regardless of the year in which drilling was initiated and does not include any wells where drilling operations were not completed as of the end of the applicable year a development well is a well drilled in an already discovered oil field 

  

the following table reflects the developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage that we held as of december 31 2014 



 

note as of december 31 2014 we have no material amount of acreage expiring in the next three years 

see “supplemental information on oil and gas activities unaudited” for additional information with respect to operating statistics and supplemental information on our oil and gas producing activities 

gas and gasoline plant interests 

operated gas plants in the permian basin of west texas 



 

 

sales and transportation activities 

co 2  segment storage and sales 

our principal market for co 2  is for injection into mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain strong for the next several years our ownership of co 2  reserves as of december 31 2014 includes 



 

 

co 2  segment pipelines 

the principal market for transportation on our co 2  pipelines is to customers including ourselves using co 2  for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the permian basin where industry demand is expected to remain stable for the next several years the tariffs charged by our co 2  pipelines are not regulated however the tariff charged on the cortez pipeline is based on a consent decree the tariffs charged on the wink pipeline system are regulated by both the ferc and the texas railroad commission our ownership of co 2  and crude oil pipelines as of december 31 2014 includes 



 

 

competition 

our primary competitors for the sale of co 2  include suppliers that have an ownership interest in mcelmo dome bravo dome and sheep mountain co 2  resources and oxy usa inc which controls waste co 2  extracted from natural gas production in the val verde basin of west texas our ownership interests in the central basin cortez and bravo pipelines are 

in direct competition with other co 2  pipelines we also compete with other interest owners in the mcelmo dome unit and the bravo dome unit for transportation of co 2  to the denver city texas market area 

terminals 

our terminals segment includes the operations of our petroleum chemical ethanol and other liquids terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines segment and all of our coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk material services facilities including all transload engineering conveying and other inplant services our terminals are located throughout the us and in portions of canada we believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide us opportunities for expansion we often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or drybulk material products in addition we have jones act qualified product tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us the following summarizes our terminals segment assets as of december 31 2014 



competition 

we are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the us based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals and terminals owned by oil chemical and pipeline companies our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services in some locations competitors are smaller independent operators with lower cost structures our rail transloading material services operations compete with a variety of single or multisite transload warehouse and terminal operators across the us our jones act qualified product tankers compete with other jones act qualified vessel fleets 

products pipelines 

 our products pipelines segment consists of our refined petroleum products crude oil and condensate and ngl pipelines and associated terminals southeast terminals and our transmix processing facilities the following summarizes our significant products pipelines segment assets we own and operate as of december 31 2014 



 

 

competition 

our products pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies other independent products pipelines trucking and marine transportation firms for shorthaul movements of products and railcars our products pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities 

kinder morgan canada 

our kinder morgan canada business segment includes our 100 owned and operated trans mountain pipeline system and a 25mile jet fuel pipeline system 

trans mountain pipeline system 

the trans mountain pipeline system originates at edmonton alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of british columbia the trans mountain pipeline is 713 miles in length we also own and operate a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of washington the 

capacity of the line at edmonton ranges from 300 mbbld when heavy crude oil represents 20 of the total throughput which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage to 400 mbbld with no heavy crude oil 

jet fuel pipeline system 

we also own and operate the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl 

competition 

trans mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and it competes against other pipeline providers however it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast furthermore as demonstrated by our previously announced expansion proposal discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—kinder morgan canada” we believe that the trans mountain pipeline facilities provide us the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop 

in december 2013 the british columbia ministry of environment granted approval for a new airport fuel consortium owned jet fuel terminal to be located near the vancouver international airport the impact of this facility on our existing jet fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time 

other 

during 2014 our other segment activity primarily includes other miscellaneous assets and liabilities purchased in our 2012 ep acquisition including i our corporate headquarters in houston texas ii several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with ep’s legacy trading activities and iii other miscellaneous ep assets and liabilities 

major customers 

our revenue is derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2  business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2  business segments in 2014 2013 and 2012 accounted for 25 28 and 28 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

on october 24 1992 congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service our subsidiary trans mountain pipeline lp is the sole owner of our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 

the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc for further information see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” above 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s through the mid1990’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 the ferc standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues including i the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees ii the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees iii the definition of transmission function information iv independent functioning v transparency and vi the interaction of 

ferc standards with the north american energy standards board business practice standards the ferc also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities in light of the changing structure of the energy industry these standards of conduct govern employee relationshipsusing a functional approachto ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis pursuant to the ferc’s standards of conduct a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee nonpublic information about the transmission system or a transmission customer additionally noconduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing nonpublic information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit 

rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees marketing function employees officers directors supervisory employees and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of our pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by us with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates the intrastate rates for movements in california on our sfpp and calnev systems have been and may in the future be subject to complaints before the cpuc as is more fully described in note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

texas railroad commission rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our crude oil pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the texas railroad commission the texas railroad commission has the authority to regulate our rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulating commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulating commission the commission that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2032 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitations i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional integrity threats and changes to the amount of pipe determined 

to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by phmsa regulations these tests could result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the president signed into law new pipeline safety legislation in january 2012 the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine maximum pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records to verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity management regulation and actual expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities repair remediation and preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which may precipitate claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

we are subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens as a result we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock if we do not comply with such requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels furthermore from time to time legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in congress to amend the jones act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between us ports be built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens if the jones act were amended in such fashion we could face competition from foreign flagged vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the us secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including us provided that we are considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 340 million as of december 31 2014 our reserve estimates range in value from approximately 340 million   to approximately 514 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations we believe that the operations of our pipelines storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources for further information see “—climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co 2  and methane our facilities are subject to and in substantial compliance with these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements additionally the epa has announced that it will propose new regulations of greenhouse gases addressing emission of greenhouse gases with a renewed focus on emissions of methane which may impose further requirements including emission control requirements on kinder morgan facilities 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa depending on the particular program we could be required to conduct monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital 

expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2  business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees 

we employed 11535 fulltime people at december 31 2014 including approximately 828 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2015 and 2018 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to our boardapproved expense allocation policy the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage 

facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

our pipelines business is dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities transported by our pipelines 

our pipelines depend on production of natural gas oil and other products in the areas served by our pipelines without reserve additions production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our gas plants and pipelines may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as the recent sharp decline in crude oil prices an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices supply disruptions or higher development costs could result in a slowing of supply from oil and natural gas producing areas in addition changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil and natural gas each of these factors impacts our customers shipping through our pipelines which in turn could impact the prospects of new transportation contracts or renewals of existing contracts 

throughput on our crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products pipelines also may decline as a result of changes in business conditions over the long term business will depend in part on the level of demand for oil natural gas and refined petroleum products in the geographic areas in which deliveries are made by pipelines and the ability and willingness of shippers having access or rights to utilize the pipelines to supply such demand 

the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products 

we may face competition from other pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil petroleum products or natural gas into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us 

our growth strategy may cause difficulties integrating acquisitions and constructing new facilities and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from any future acquisitions or expansions 

part of our business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses expanding existing assets and constructing new facilities if we do not successfully integrate acquisitions expansions or newly constructed facilities we may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings the integration of acquired companies or new assets involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in our size ii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting estimating reporting and other systems iv difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees and v potential adverse effects on operating results 

we may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition expansion or construction project will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs difficulties in integration may be magnified if we make multiple acquisitions over a relatively short period of time because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that we hoped to achieve after these acquisitions and expansions which would harm our financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 41 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments additionally in connection with the merger transactions we and substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees the indebtedness of each other party to the agreement thereby causing us to become liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries this level of debt and the cross guarantee agreement could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii increasing the cost of our future borrowings iii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iv placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and v increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our debt will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness including the crossguaranteed debt and any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions which may include reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

new regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes in regulations by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our income and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state provincial and local regulatory authorities regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service ii the types of services we may offer to our customers iii the contracts for service entered into with our customers iv the certification and construction of new facilities v the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vi the acquisition of other businesses vii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities viii reporting and information posting requirements ix the maintenance of accounts and records and x relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines furthermore new laws or regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—regulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file for and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may continue to initiate investigations to determine whether interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on our pipelines any successful challenge to our rates could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

energy commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to natural gas transmission and storage activities and refined petroleum products and co 2  transportation activitiessuch as leaks explosions and mechanical problemsthat could result in substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and earnings while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines for the dot and pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of compliance costs relate to pipeline integrity testing and repairs technological advances in inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a 

significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state or provincial laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us 

methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases the epa regulates greenhouse gas emissions and requires the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the us for emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources fractionated ngl and the production of naturally occurring co 2  like our mcelmo dome co 2  field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere 

because our operations including our compressor stations and natural gas processing plants in our natural gas pipelines segment emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells as well as reductions in production from existing wells which could adversely impact the volumes of natural gas transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines and our own oil and gas development and production activities 

oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control the oil and gas industry is increasingly relying on supplies of hydrocarbons from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of hydrocarbons from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of natural gas and in turn adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines several of which gather gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent 

in addition many states are promulgating stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities these laws and regulations may adversely affect our oil and gas development and production activities 

our acquisition strategy and expansion programs require access to new capital limitations on our access to capital would impair our ability to grow 

we rely on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisition and growth capital expenditures however to the extent we are unable to continue to finance growth externally our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow we may need new capital to finance these activities limitations on our access to capital whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise will impair our ability to execute this strategy 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 11 billion of our approximately 41 billion of consolidated debt excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm debt of variable rate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps 

should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs    

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us some of the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities and reducing our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any reduction in our credit ratings could negatively impact the credit ratings of our subsidiaries which could increase their cost of capital and negatively affect their business and operating results although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt securities 

cost overruns and delays on our expansion and new build projects could adversely affect our business 

we regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets and to construct new assets a variety of factors outside of our control such as weather natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals as well as performance by thirdparty contractors has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows 

we must either obtain the right from landowners or exercise the power of eminent domain in order to use most of the land on which our pipelines are constructed and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use 

we obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land for a period of time if we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines our business could be negatively affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners primarily through rental increases and renewals of expired agreements 

whether we have the power of eminent domain for our pipelines other than interstate natural gas pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipelinepetroleum liquids natural gas co 2  or crude oiland the laws of the particular state our interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority in either case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court our inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect our business if we were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which our pipelines are located 

current or future distressed financial conditions of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide   

some of our customers are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more 

of our customers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities in addition such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the us and canada volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil and ngl will have a negative impact on the results of our co 2  business segment if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events or the threat of them may adversely affect our business 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems or operating systems and may affect our ability to operate or control our pipeline assets our operations could be disrupted andor customer information could be stolen the occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to reputation increased regulation or litigation or inaccurate information reported from our operations there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

the future success of our oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves and revenues of the oil and gas producing assets within our co 2  business segment will decline we may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if we do not realize production volumes greater than or equal to our hedged volumes we may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

the development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a 

productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

the volatility of oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our co 2  and natural gas pipeline business segments 

the revenues profitability and future growth of our co 2  and natural gas pipeline business segments and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas properties depend to a large degree on prevailing oil and gas prices for 2015 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact our distributable cash flow by approximately   10 million and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas impacts distributable cash flow by approximately 3 million prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond our control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political stability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas would result in a commensurate reduction in our revenues income and cash flows from the production of oil ngl and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves in the event prices fall substantially we may not be able to realize a profit from our production and would operate at a loss in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—energy commodity market risk” 

our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not always possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely mitigate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—hedging activities” and note 13 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the cftc has proposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the doddfrank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments 

to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us the doddfrank act and any related regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade or result in the forfeiture of our vessels otherwise adversely impact our income and operations 

following our 2014 acquisitions of american petroleum tankers state class tankers and the pennsylvania and florida jones act tankers from crowley maritime corporation tankers we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and manned by predominately us crews our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could be adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens 

our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and the loss of such workforce could result in the failure to implement our business plans 

our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers technical personnel and other professionals we and our affiliates compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce in addition many of our current employees are retirement eligible and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees if we are unable to i retain current employees ii successfully complete the knowledge transfer andor iii recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience our business could be negatively impacted in addition we could experience increased allocated costs to retain and recruit these professionals 

if we are unable to retain our chairman or executive officers our growth may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our chairman and our executive officers particularly our chairman and current chief executive officer richard d kinder who is also one of our founders and our current president and chief operating officer steve kean who will assume the chief executive officer position in june of 2015 along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder and mr kean have been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder mr kean or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

our kinder morgan canada segment is subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada business segment a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may be volatile and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investments 

the market price of our common stock could be volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it due to fluctuations in its market price including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock include i changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock other companies comparable to us or companies in the industries we serve ii actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects iii reaction to our public announcements iv strategic actions taken by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings v the recruitment or departure of key personnel vi new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations vii changes in tax or accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles viii adverse conditions in the financial markets or general us or international economic conditions including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism and responses to such events and ix sales of common stock by us members of our management team or significant stockholders 

nonus holders of our common stock may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on the disposition of our common stock 

if we are or have been a “us real property holding corporation’’ within the meaning of the code at any time within the shorter of i the fiveyear period preceding a disposition of our common stock by a nonus holder or ii such holder’s holding period for such common stock and assuming our common stock is “regularly traded’’ as defined by applicable us treasury regulations on an established securities market the nonus holder may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on such disposition if it held more than 5 of our common stock during the shorter of periods i and ii above we believe we are or may become a us real property holding corporation 

the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business 

we disclose in this report and elsewhere our expected cash dividends this reflects our current judgment but as with any estimate it may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and known and unknown risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control see “information regarding forwardlooking statements” if the payment of dividends at the anticipated level would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities including through acquisitions to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements to fund our operations or otherwise to address properly our business prospects our business would be harmed conversely a decision to address such needs might lead to the payment of dividends below the anticipated level as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable our board of directors which determines our business strategy and our dividends might have to choose between addressing those matters or reducing our anticipated dividends alternatively because there is nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends our board of directors may choose to cause us to incur debt to enable us to pay our anticipated dividends this would add to our substantial debt discussed above under “risks related to our business our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic consequences ”

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal objectives 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

 

   

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the various us and canadian energy industries and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly the texas intrastate natural gas group currently derives approximately 75 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts that include requirements with minimum volume payment obligations as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2014 the remaining average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ purchase and sales contracts was approximately   six years 

our midstream group which is within our natural gas pipelines segment provides gathering and processing services primarily through our i ep midstream asset operations which we acquired 50 from kkr effective june 1 2012 and 50 from the may 25 2012 ep acquisition ii our copano operations which included the remaining 50 ownership interest in eagle ford gathering llc eagle ford that we did not already own and which was acquired effective may 1 2013 and iii our kinderhawk operation which gathers and treats natural gas in the haynesville and bossier shale gas formations located in northwest louisiana these substantially feebased gathering processing and fractionation assets along with our financial strength and extensive pipeline transportation and storage assets provide an excellent platform to further grow our midstream group services footprint the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are also affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems which are primarily driven by levels of natural gas drilling activity our midstream group services are provided pursuant to a variety of arrangements generally categorized by the nature of the commodity price risk as feebased percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

in february 2015 we acquired hiland partners hiland for a total purchase price of approximately 3 billion including assumption of debt hiland’s assets consist of crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines and gas gathering and processing systems primarily serving production from the bakken formation in north dakota and montana most of hiland’s operations will be included in our midstream group within our natural gas pipelines segment 

the co 2  source and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2014 had a remaining average contract life of approximately   ten years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2015 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2015 budget approximately 86 of our revenue is based on a fixed fee or floor price and 14 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2  business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2  business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil ngl and co 2  sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales 

quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was 8841 per barrel in 2014 9270 per barrel in 2013 and 8772 per barrel in 2012 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 8648 per barrel in 2014 9494 per barrel in 2013 and 8991 per barrel in 2012 

the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums because these contracts are volume based above the minimums our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts   which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods our seven jones act qualified tankers operate in the marine transportation of crude oil condensate and refined products in the us and are currently operating pursuant to multiyear charters with major integrated oil companies major refiners and the us military sealift command 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

our 2015 budget and related announced expectation to declare dividends of 200 per share for 2015 assumes an average wti crude oil price of approximately 70 per barrel and an average natural gas price of 380 per mmbtu in 2015 for 2015 we estimate that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel will impact our distributable cash flow by approximately 10 million approximately 7 million of which is attributable to our co 2  business segment and each 010 per mmbtu change in the average price of natural gas will impact distributable cash flow by approximately 3 million   this assumes we do not add additional hedges during the year which could reduce these sensitivities these sensitivities compare to total anticipated segment earnings before dda in 2015 of approximately 8 billion adding back our share of joint venture dda even adjusting for current commodity prices we expect to have significant excess coverage in 2015 

the amount that we are able to increase dividends to our shareholders will to some extent be a function of our ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions we believe we will continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets and we have budgeted approximately   44 billion for our 2015 capital expansion program including small acquisitions and investment contributions but excluding our recent acquisition of hiland partners lp we consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions 

based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations furthermore our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost and includes factors over which we have limited or no control thus we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 

our ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand our assets is impacted by our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions our dividend policy is to distribute most of our available cash and we intend to continue accessing capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions historically we have succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund our acquisitions and expansions and although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit we believe that our stable cash flows credit ratings and historical records of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment dividend and acquisition strategies as well as refinance maturing debt when required for a further discussion of our liquidity including our and our subsidiaries’ public debt and equity offerings in 2014 please see “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

in addition a portion of our business portfolio including the kinder morgan canada business segment the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline and the bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada use the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and we enter into foreign currencybased transactions both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates to help understand our reported operating results all of the following references to “foreign currency effects” or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results in us dollars resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar the references are made to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

  

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows

for acquired businesses we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected for more information on legal proceedings see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year there were no impairment charges resulting from our may 31 2014 impairment testing and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date other than 2 million associated with a pending asset divestiture furthermore our analysis as of that date did not reflect any reporting units at risk and subsequent to that date no event has occurred indicating that the implied fair value of each of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of its net assets for more information on our goodwill see notes 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and 7 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for more information on our amortizable intangibles see note 7 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements 

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing 

activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves please see “supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities unaudited” 

the quantities of our proved oil and gas reserves and the measures of discounted future net cash flows from those oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2014 are based on the 12 month unweighted average of the first day of the month price realized in 2014 commodity prices fell substantially toward the end of 2014 and therefore unless commodity prices recover in the next 12 months the amount of our proved oil and gas reserves and the measures of discounted future net cash flows from those oil and gas reserves could be negatively impacted in 2015 any resulting reductions in our proved oil and gas reserves due to lower commodity pricing may increase our dda expense sustained lower commodity prices may also negatively impact forward curve pricing that is used in testing for impairment estimated total proved and riskadjusted probable and possible oil and gas reserves and related expected future cash flows which may result in impairment of our oil producing interests 

  

hedging activities 

  

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately we may or may not apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts depending on the circumstances all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value 

  

since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity pricesa perfectly effective hedgewe often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for example when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations accordingly our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges for more information on our hedging activities see note 13 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2014 our pension plans were underfunded by   427 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by   235 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we select our discount rates by matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to the average yields of various highquality bonds with corresponding maturities the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 9 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of 

expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants we record these deferred amounts as either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations as of december 31 2014 we had deferred net losses of approximately 323 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2014 

 

income taxes 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

  

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investments 

results of operations 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap financial measures dcf before certain items and segment ebda before certain items are presented below under “—distributable cash flow” and   “—consolidated earnings results” respectively    certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either do not have a cash impact or by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically 

our nongaap measures described below should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income or any other gaap measure dcf before certain items and segment ebda before certain items are not financial measures in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider either of these nongaap measures in 

isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap because dcf before certain items excludes some but not all items that affect net income and because dcf measures are defined differently by different companies in our industry our dcf before certain items may not be comparable to dcf measures of other companies our computation of segment ebda before certain items has similar limitations management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

distributable cash flow 

  

dcf before certain items is an overall performance metric we use to estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash flows on an ongoing basis and as a measure of cash available to pay dividends we believe the primary measure of company performance used by us investors and industry analysts is cash generation performance therefore we believe dcf before certain items is an important measure to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare it with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry for a discussion of our anticipated dividends for 2015 see “—financial condition—cash flows—kmi dividends” 

  

the table below details the reconciliation of net income to dcf before certain items

consolidated earnings results 

with regard to our reportable business segments we consider segment earnings before all dda expenses and amortization of excess cost of equity investments defined in the “—results of operations” tables below and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our shareholders we also use segment ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our six reportable business segments ebda may not be comparable to measures used by other companies additionally ebda should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income income from continuing operations or operating cash flows 

certain items included in ebda are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance in general the items not included in segment results are interest expense general and administrative expenses dda and unallocable income taxes these items are not controllable by our business segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate servicesincluding accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment ebda in relation to the level of capital employed we consider each period’s ebda to be an important measure of business segment performance for our segments we account for intersegment sales at market prices we account for the transfer of net assets between entities under common control by carrying forward the net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination transfers of net assets between entities under common control do not affect the income statement of the combined entity

the kinder morgan canada business segment includes the operations of the trans mountain and jet fuel pipeline systems and until march 14 2013 the effective date of sale our onethird ownership interest in the express crude oil pipeline system 

  

following is information related to increases and decreases in both ebda and revenues before certain items in 2014 and 2013 when compared with the respective prior year 



 

na  not applicable 

 

for the comparable years of 2014 and 2013 the trans mountain pipeline had a decrease in earnings of 12 million 6 which was driven primarily by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the canadian dollar since the end of the third quarter of 2013 we translated canadian denominated income and expense amounts into fewer us dollars in 2014 

  



 

na  not applicable 

 

the periodtoperiod decreases in ebda from express were primarily due to both lower equity earnings and lower interest income resulting from the sale of our equity and debt investments in express effective march 14 2013 

the decreases in trans mountain’s earnings were driven by i higher income tax expenses due largely to general increases in british columbia’s income tax rates since the end of the third quarter of 2012 ii unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the canadian dollar since the end of 2012 we translated canadian denominated income and expense amounts into less us dollars in 2013 and iii lower management incentive fees earned from the operation of the express pipeline system due to its sale in march 2013 the periodtoperiod decreases in trans mountain’s earnings were partially offset by incremental nonoperating income from allowances for funds used during construction representing an estimate of the cost of capital funded by equity contributions 

other 

our other segment results are driven by activities from other miscellaneous assets and liabilities purchased in our 2012 ep acquisition that were not allocated to the above segments this segment contributed earnings of 13 million a loss of 5 million and earnings of 7 million for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively however 2014 and 2012 earnings include a certain item of 22 million increase in earnings and 10 million decrease in earnings respectively primarily related to our foreign operations after taking into effect the certain item the earnings for 2014 and 2013 decreased by 4 million and 22 million respectively when compared with the respective prior year 

general and administrative interest and noncontrolling interests

v 29 million of other ep acquisition expenses and vi a combined 14 million increase in expense from other certain items partially offset by a 29 million benefit associated with pension income 

 other footnote 

 

items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses unallocable interest income and income tax expense interest expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests our general and administrative expenses include such items as unallocated salaries and employeerelated expenses employee benefits payroll taxes insurance office supplies and rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services including accounting information technology human resources and legal services these expenses are generally not controllable by our business segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance for this reason we do not specifically allocate our general and administrative expenses to the business segments as discussed previously we use segment ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss to evaluate segment performance and each of our segment’s ebda includes all costs directly incurred by that segment 

the increase in general and administrative expenses before certain items of 17 million and 57 million in 2014 and 2013 when compared with the respective prior year was primarily driven by the acquisition of copano effective may 1 2013 and ep effective may 25 2012 additional drivers were higher benefit costs payroll taxes and segment labor expenses partially offset by lower costs on our corporate headquarters building and insurance costs 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount our consolidated interest expense net of interest income and other net before certain items increased 90 million and 366 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively when compared with the respective prior year the increase in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher average debt balances as a result of capital expenditures joint venture contributions and acquisitions that were made during 2014 and issuing 6 billion of debt primarily related to the merger transactions in november 2014 in addition the increase was impacted by the refinancing of the shortterm kmi credit facility debt with a 15 billion longterm debt issuance in november 2013 which had a higher interest rate this increase in interest expense was partially offset by i lower average balances outstanding on our ep acquisition term loan as a result of its termination in november 2014 and ii lower interest rates on our credit facility and ep acquisition term loan as a result of the refinancing of these facilities in 2014  

  

the increase in interest expense in 2013 as compared to respective prior year was primarily due to interest expense incurred from ep acquisition debt debt assumed in the ep acquisition and other business acquisitions see notes 3 “acquisition and divestitures” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements also contributed to the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 were higher effective interest rates and higher average borrowings which were largely due to the capital expenditures and joint venture contributions for more information on the capital expenditures and capital contributions see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

we use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 approximately 26 of our debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rateseither as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps as of december 31 2013 approximately 25 of our debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rates for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 13 “risk management—interest rate risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us the 82 million decrease 5 for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to our noncontrolling interests’ portion of i our 2013 558 million pretax gain 

from the remeasurement of our previously held 50 equity interest in eagle ford to fair value and ii our 2013 140 million aftertax gain on the sale of our investments in the express pipeline system which was partially offset by our noncontrolling interests’ portion of our 2014 198 million pretax increase associated with the early termination of a longterm natural gas transportation contract on our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system and an increase in income allocated to noncontolling interests during the fourth quarter 2014 due to the elimination of the incentive distribution rights as a result of the merger transactions the 1387 million 1238 increase for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to our noncontrolling interests’ portion of i our 2013 558 million gain from the remeasurement of our previously held 50 equity interest in eagle ford to fair value ii our 2013 140 million aftertax gain on the sale of our investments in the express pipeline system iii additional income from ep assets acquired in 2012 iv additional income from our 2013 acquisition of copano and v the 2012 noncash loss of 937 million net of tax loss from both costs to sell and the remeasurement of ftc natural gas pipeline disposal group net assets to fair value 

subsequent to the merger transactions net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents net income allocated to thirdparty ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger transactions it also included net income allocated to kmp and epb limited partner units formerly owned by the public 

income taxes—continuing operations 

  

year ended december 31 2014 versus year ended december 31 2013 

our tax expense for income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2014 was   648 million as compared with 2013 income tax expense of 742 million   the   94 million decrease in tax expense is due primarily to i the tax impact of significantly lower pretax earnings in 2014 associated with our investment in kmp primarily as a result of kmp’s 2014 recognition of a 235 million impairment of its co 2  assets compared to gains it recognized in 2013 of 558 million on remeasurement to fair value of its initial 50 interest in the eagle ford joint venture and 224 million on the sale of its onethird interest in the express pipeline system ii a 2014 worthless stock deduction related to our brazil operations and iii a 2013 decrease in our share of non taxdeductible goodwill associated with our investment in kmp as a result of our change in ownership primarily due to kmp’s acquisition of copano these decreases are partially offset by i the tax benefit in 2013 of a decrease in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the dropdown of our 50 ownership interest in epng and midstream assets and kmp’s acquisition of copano ii 2013 adjustments to our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of legacy ep internal revenue service audits and iii the 2014 recording of a valuation allowance related to our investment in ngpl 

year ended december 31 2013 versus year ended december 31 2012 

our tax expense for income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2013 was 742 million as compared with 2012 income tax expense of 139 million the 603 million increase in tax expense is due primarily to i higher income in 2013 attributable to our investments in kmp and epb as compared to 2012 and ii tax expense as a result of kmp’s 2013 sale of its onethird interest in the express pipeline system these increases are partially offset by a decrease in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the march 2013 dropdown transaction and kmp’s copano acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2014 we had a combined 315 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” on our consolidated balance sheet a decrease of 283 million   47  from december 31 2013 we believe our cash position and remaining borrowing capacity discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and our access to financial resources are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations 

our primary cash requirements in addition to normal operating expenses are for debt service sustaining capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures and quarterly dividends to our common shareholders 

  

in general we expect to fund 

 61 

 

in addition to our results of operations our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities as discussed below in “—financing activities” cash provided from our operations is fairly stable across periods since a majority of our cash generated is fee based from a diversified portfolio of assets and is not sensitive to commodity prices however in our co 2  business segment while we hedge the majority of our oil production we do have exposure to unhedged volumes a significant portion of which are ngl 

historically our distributions to noncontrolling interests were primarily comprised of distributions made by kmp and epb on their common units that were not owned by us with the closing of the merger transactions all the previously held equity securities of kmp epb and kmr are now owned by us as partial consideration for the kmp epb and kmr equity securities that we did not already own as of the merger transactions date we issued approximately 1097 million kmi class p common shares we expect that dividends on kmi’s class p common stock will be 200 per share for 2015 also see “—kmi dividends” 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

based on our historical record we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we expect that our shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through shortterm borrowings we are subject however to conditions in the equity and debt markets and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the capital markets we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our andor our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

our shortterm corporate debt rating is a3 prime3 and f3 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

 the following table represents kmi’s and kmp’s senior unsecured debt ratings as of december 31 2014 



  

 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2014 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i our 40 billion revolving credit facility and associated 40 billion commercial paper program discussed following and ii cash from operations the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used to fund borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes and also serve as a backup for our commercial paper program we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity under our credit facility and have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4467 million  and 4122 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “cash flows—operating activities” 

effective upon the closing of the merger transactions on november 26 2014 we replaced the prior kmi credit agreement the kmp credit agreement and the epb credit agreement with a 5year 4 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which can be increased to 5 billion if certain circumstances are met on november 26 2014 we entered into a 40 billion commercial paper program borrowings under our commercial paper program and letters of credit reduce borrowings allowed under our credit facility for additional information on our credit facility and commercial paper program see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with the hiland acquisition we entered into and made borrowings of 1641 million under a new sixmonth bridge credit facility with ubs ag stamford branch the credit facility bears interest at the same rate as our 40 billion 

revolving credit facility and the borrowing capacity is reduced by any payments made as of the date of this filing we had 1516 million outstanding under this credit facility 

our shortterm debt as of december 31 2014 was 2717 million  primarily consisting of i 1236 million  combined outstanding borrowings under our 4 billion  credit facility and 4 billion  commercial paper program ii 375 million  in principal amount of 410 senior notes that mature november 15 2015 iii 340 million  in principal amount of 680 senior notes that mature november 15 2015 iv 300 million  in principal amount of 5625 senior notes that mature february 15 2015 and v 250 million  in principal amount of 515 senior notes that mature march 1 2015 we intend to refinance our shortterm debt through additional credit facility borrowings commercial paper borrowings issuing new longterm debt or with proceeds from asset sales our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2013 was 2306 million  

  

we had working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficits of 2610 million  and 2207 million  as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively our current liabilities include shortterm borrowings used to finance our expansion capital expenditures which are periodically replaced with longterm financing the overall 403 million   18  unfavorable change from yearend 2013 was primarily due to i a net increase in kmi’s credit facility and commercial paper borrowings ii lower cash balances described above and iii an increase in the current portion of longterm debt the overall increase in our working capital deficit was partially offset by the repayment of kmp’s commercial paper borrowings and the subsequent termination of the program generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our combined cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our equity issuances and our or our subsidiaries’ debt issuances discussed below in “—longterm financing” and “— capital expenditures” 

we employ a centralized cash management program for our usbased bank accounts that concentrates the cash assets of our subsidiaries their operating partnerships and their whollyowned subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of our subsidiaries their operating partnerships and their whollyowned subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within the consolidated group we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 

certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

in addition to our principal sources of shortterm liquidity listed above we could meet our cash requirements through the issuance of longterm securities or additional common shares our equity offerings consist of the issuance of additional class p common stock with a par value of 001 per share through an equity distribution agreement we can issue and sell through or to our sales agents andor principals shares of our class p common stock from time to time up to an aggregate offering price of 5 billion for more information on our equity issuances during 2014 and our equity distribution agreement see note 10 “stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements 

from time to time we issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of our senior notes issued to date other than those issued by certain of our subsidiaries generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of our fixed rate senior notes provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the various series of kmi’s senior notes excluding our subsidiaries’ senior borrowings discussed below was 11438 million including 6 billion issued in 2014 to fund the cash portion of consideration of the merger transactions and 5645 million respectively 

in addition from time to time our subsidiaries including kmp tgp epng cig sng and copano have issued longterm debt securities often referred to as their senior notes most of the debt of our subsidiaries is unsecured however a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by our subsidiaries as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the total liability balance due on the various borrowings of our subsidiaries including senior notes issued by kmp tgp epng cig sng and copano was   28355 million  and   25889 million  respectively 

furthermore we and almost all of our direct and indirect whollyowned domestic subsidiaries are parties to a cross guaranty wherein we each guarantee the debt of each other see note 18 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements 

to date our and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness for additional information about our debtrelated transactions in 2014 see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

capital structure 

  

we finance our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with a combination of equity and debt in order to maintain an approximate net debt to ebitda ratio between 50 and 55 in the shortterm we may fund these expenditures from borrowings under our credit facility until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt equity or both 

we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing longterm fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments and through the issuance of commercial paper or credit facility borrowings 

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap we also distinguish between capital expenditures that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are expansion capital expenditures which we also refer to as discretionary capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating dcf see “results of operations—distributable cash flow” with respect to our oil and gas producing activities we classify a capital expenditure as an expansion capital expenditure if it is expected to increase capacity or throughput ie production capacity from the capacity or throughput immediately prior to the making or acquisition of such additions or improvements maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity the distinction between maintenance and expansion capital expenditures is a physical determination rather than an economic one irrespective of the amount by which the throughput or capacity is increased 

budgeting of maintenance capital expenditures is done annually on a bottomup basis for each of our assets we budget for and make those maintenance capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain safe and efficient operations meet customer needs and comply with our operating policies and applicable law we may budget for and make additional maintenance capital expenditures that we expect to produce economic benefits such as increasing efficiency andor lowering future expenses budgeting and approval of expansion capital expenditures are generally made periodically throughout the year on a projectbyproject basis in response to specific investment opportunities identified by our business segments from which we generally expect to receive sufficient returns to justify the expenditures generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenancesustaining or as expansion capital expenditures is made on a project level the classification of our capital expenditures as expansion capital expenditures or as maintenance capital expenditures is made consistent with our accounting policies and is generally a straightforward process but in certain circumstances can be a matter of management judgment and discretion  the classification has an impact on cash available to pay dividends because capital expenditures that are classified as expansion capital expenditures are not deducted from dcf while those classified as maintenance capital expenditures are see “—kmi dividends” 

  

our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2014 and the amount we expect to spend for 2015 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

as disclosed elsewhere in this report we expect to pay cash dividends totaling 200 per share on our common stock for 2015 there is nothing in our governing documents or credit agreements that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements business prospects capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws delaware laws and other factors see item 1a “risk factors— the guidance we provide for our anticipated dividends is based on estimates circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business” all of these matters will be taken into consideration by our board of directors in declaring dividends 

our dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future our dividends generally will be paid on or about the 16th day of each february may august and november

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we use include energy products traded on the nymex and otc markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

as part of the ep acquisition we acquired power forward and swap contracts we have entered into offsetting positions that eliminate the price risks associated with our power contracts none of these derivatives are designated as accounting hedges 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous financial position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our physical position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas we often enter into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful to the extent gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



 

as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividend targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 

  

in accounting for cash flow hedges gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income outside “net income” reported in our consolidated statements of income but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income that is for cash flow hedges all effective components of the derivative contracts’ gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income pending occurrence of the expected transaction other comprehensive income consists of those financial items that are within “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are within “noncontrolling interests” and are not included in our net income thus in highly effective cash flow hedges where there is no ineffectiveness other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion and those contracts not designated as hedges are included in current net income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss in addition when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “noncontrolling interests” and are transferred to the income statement as well effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability amounts 

should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales depreciation interest expense etc 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas ngl crude oil and power derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values as of december 31 2014  and 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity natural gas prices would affect the estimated fair value of natural gas derivatives by 9 million  and 15 million  respectively as of december 31 2014  and 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity crude oil prices would affect the estimated fair value of crude oil derivative by 146 million  and 201 million  respectively as of december 31 2014  and 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity ngl prices would affect the estimated fair value of our ngl derivatives by 03 million  and 5 million  respectively as of both december 31 2014  and 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity electricity prices would not affect the estimated fair value of our power derivatives as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the natural gas ngl crude oil and power portfolios of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 

  

as of december 31 2014  and 2013 the carrying values of the fixed rate debt including the debt fair value adjustments were 41538 million  and 33129 million  respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2014  and 2013 fair values of 42164 million  and 33185 million  respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2014 and 2013 would result in changes of approximately 1539 million  and 1185 million  respectively in the fair values of these instruments 

the carrying value of the variable rate debt which approximates the fair value excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following was 1425 million  and 3064 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013 respectively as of december 31 2014  and 2013 we were party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 9200 million and 5400 million  respectively an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal which is called the notional principal amount normally at each payment or settlement date the party who owes more pays the net amount so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 50 basis points  in 2014 and approximately 51 basis points  in 2013 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2014  and 2013 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 53 million  and 43 million  respectively in our 2014 and 2013 annual pretax earnings 

interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

  

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements as of december 31 2014  approximately 26  is variable rate debt

natural gas pipelines 

kmp 

  

 

on august 1 2012 kmp acquired both the full ownership interest in tgp and an initial 50 ownership interest in epng from us for an aggregate consideration of approximately 62 billion consisting of cash paid common units issued and debt assumed in this report we refer to the august 1 2012 acquisition of assets from us as the august 2012 dropdown transaction the combined group of assets acquired from us effective august 1 2012 as the august 2012 dropdown asset group the combined august 2012 dropdown transaction and the march 2013 dropdown transaction described above as the dropdown transactions and the combined august 2012 dropdown asset group and the march 2013 dropdown asset group described above as the dropdown asset groups 

 

kmp’s acquisition of copano added midstream natural gas assets located primarily in texas oklahoma and wyoming to its existing business portfolio and enlarged its existing service offerings to natural gas producers including gathering processing treating and fractionation additionally as a result of this acquisition kmp is currently pursing incremental development projects in the eagle ford shale formation in south texas and has gained entry into the barnett shale formation in north texas and the mississippi lime and woodford shale formations in oklahoma for more information about this acquisition see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements

the crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through trans mountain pipeline system originate in alberta and british columbia the refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to kamloops british columbia and vancouver originate from oil refineries located in edmonton alberta petroleum products delivered through trans mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in british columbia washington state and elsewhere offshore in 2013 the trans mountain pipeline system delivered an average of 264 mbbld in february 2013 trans mountain completed negotiations with the canadian association of petroleum producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning january 1 2013 and ending december 31 2015 the neb approved the toll settlement in april 2013 the 20132015 negotiated settlement contains provisions for extension of the settlement that would likely cause the 20132015 settlement to be extended to the completion of the expansion of trans mountain at the end of 2017 in 2012 trans mountain succeeded in contracting approximately 80 of its total planned capacity based on a 54 billion expansion of the trans mountain pipeline 

from 300 mbbl to 890 mbbl based on 15 and 20 year take or pay contracts in may 2013 the neb approved the commercial terms of the expansion agreement on december 16 2013 trans mountain filed its application for a certificate of public need including neb approval on all remaining aspects of the project the regulatory process is expected to be completed in the middle of 2015 

trans mountain also operates a 53 mile spur line from its sumas pump station to the us  canada international border where it connects with kmp’s approximate 63mile 16inch to 20inch diameter puget sound pipeline system the puget sound pipeline system in the state of washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 180 mbbld when heavy crude oil represents approximately 5 of throughput and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern washington state the volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in alaska and other offshore sources and in response to available capacity on the trans mountain system 

jet fuel pipeline system 

kmp also owns and operates the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 mbbl 

competition 

trans mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and it competes against other pipeline providers however it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from alberta to the west coast furthermore as demonstrated by kmp’s previously announced expansion proposal discussed above in “a general development of businessrecent developmentskinder morgan canada” it believes that the trans mountain pipeline facilities provide it the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop 

in december 2013 the british columbia ministry of environment granted approval for a new airport fuel consortium owned jet fuel terminal to be located near the vancouver international airport the impact of this facility on our existing jet fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time 

other

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

on october 24 1992 congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on kmp’s pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service our subsidiary trans mountain pipeline lp is the sole owner of our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 

the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc for further information see “interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” above 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s through the mid1990’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes 

intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 the ferc standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues including i the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees ii the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees iii the definition of transmission function information iv independent functioning v transparency and vi the interaction of ferc standards with the north american energy standards board business practice standards the ferc also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities in light of the changing structure of the energy industry these standards of conduct govern employee relationshipsusing a functional approachto ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis pursuant to the ferc’s standards of conduct a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee nonpublic information about the transmission system or a transmission customer additionally noconduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing nonpublic information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit 

rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees marketing function employees officers directors supervisory employees and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

cpuc rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of kmp’s pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by kmp with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to kmp’s ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates certain of the pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been and continue to be subject to complaints with the cpuc as is more fully described in note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

texas railroad commission rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the texas railroad commission the texas railroad commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulating commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulating commission the commission that defines the general and directional conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service this permit expires in 2032 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitations i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the project presented to the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by the department of transportation phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the department of transportation rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the president signed into law new pipeline safety legislation in january 2012 the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules among other matters and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years phmsa is also currently considering changes to its regulations in 2012 phmsa issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities any repair remediation preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health administration osha and other comparable federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

marine operations 

the operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property personnel and cargo under general maritime law these obligations create a variety of risks including among other things the risk of collision which 

may precipitate claims for personal injury cargo contract pollution third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities 

kmp is subject to the jones act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between us departure and destination points to vessels built and registered in the us and owned and manned by us citizens as a result kmp monitors the foreign ownership of its ownership interests if kmp does not comply with such requirements it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances kmp would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer resulting in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for its vessels fines or forfeiture of the vessels 

in addition the us coast guard and the american bureau of shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for usflag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience the jones act and general maritime law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness 

the merchant marine act of 1936 is a federal law that provides upon proclamation by the us president of a national emergency or a threat to the national security the us secretary of transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by us citizens including kmp provided that kmp is considered a us citizen for this purpose if one of its vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the us government under this law kmp would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or in the case of a requisition the fair market value of charter hire however kmp would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in accordance with gaap we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 378 million  as of december 31 2013 our reserve estimates range in value from approximately 378 million   to approximately 562 million    and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations we believe that the operations of our pipelines storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes the epa regulations under the clean air act contain requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources for further information see “climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil 

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

beginning in december 2009 epa published several findings and rulemakings under the clean air act requiring the 

permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including co2 and methane our facilities are subject to substantial compliance with these requirements operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements additionally the epa has announced that it will propose new regulations of greenhouse gases which may impose further requirements including emission control requirements on kinder morgan facilities 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already 

have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the epa depending on the particular program we could be required to conduct monitoring do additional emissions reporting andor purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our and our subsidiaries operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or epa regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our co 2 kmp business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

department of homeland security 

the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs has regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities the dhs has promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

other 

employees 

we employed 11075 fulltime people at december 31 2013 including approximately 828 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2014 and 2018 we consider relations with our employees to be good 

most of our employees are employed by a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units subsidiaries or limited partnerships the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and 

other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships pursuant to existing expense allocation procedures the effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs these processes are in accordance with limited partnership agreements board of directors’ approved policies and other agreements including the delegation of control agreement among kmgp kmr kmp and others 

properties 

we believe that we generally have satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

we are dependent on cash distributions received from kmp and epb 

for 2013 distributions from kmp and epb represented approximately 87 of the sum of total cash generated by i distributions payable to us by our mlps on a declared basis and ii distributable cash generated by assets we own and our share of cash generated by our joint venture investments a decline in kmp’s andor epb’s revenues or increases in its general and administrative expenses principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments expenditures for taxes working capital requirements or other cash needs will limit the amount of cash kmp and epb can distribute to us which would reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders which could be material 

new regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes in regulations by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our income and operations 

our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service ii the types of services we may offer to our customers iii the contracts for service entered into with our customers iv the certification and construction of new facilities v the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vi the acquisition of other businesses vii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities viii reporting and information posting requirements ix the maintenance of accounts and records and x relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines furthermore new laws or regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources for example the department of homeland security appropriation act of 2007 required the issuance of regulations establishing riskbased performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk” new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessregulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb allows us to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results can be negatively impacted 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may initiate investigations to determine whether some interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 16 “litigation environmental and other” to our consolidated financial statements to the rates we charge on kmp’s epb’s and our other pipelines any successful challenge could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

energy commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to natural gas transmission and storage activities and refined petroleum products and co 2  transportation activitiessuch as leaks explosions and mechanical problemsthat could result in substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and earnings while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

primarily through our regulated pipeline subsidiaries we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines for the us dot and pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of the compliance costs are pipeline integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in high consequence areas can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the us dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

the jones act includes restrictions on ownership by nonus citizens of our vessels and failure to comply with the jones act or changes to or repeal of the jones act could limit our ability to operate our vessels in the us coastwise trade or result in the forfeiture of our vessels otherwise adversely impact our income and operations 

following our january 2014 acquisition of american petroleum tankers and state class tankers we are subject to the jones act which generally restricts us pointtopoint maritime shipping to vessels operating under the us flag built in the us owned and operated by usorganized companies that are controlled and at least 75 owned by us citizens and manned by predominately us crews our business would be adversely affected if we fail to comply with the jones act provisions on coastwise trade if we do not comply with any of these requirements we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and under certain circumstances we could be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved transfer to nonus citizens that could result in severe penalties including permanent loss of us coastwise trading rights for our vessels fines or forfeiture of vessels our business could by adversely affected if the jones act were to be modified or repealed so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same us government imposed burdens 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities   

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

in addition our oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and 

regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control due to the rise of oil and gas production in new areas of the 

country and increased public scrutiny of fracturing and other practices in oil and gas drilling many states are promulgating 

stricter requirements not only for wells but also compressor stations and other facilities in the oil and gas industry sector these 

laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a 

given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before 

drilling restrictions on drilling activities and location emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of 

hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and 

facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change” 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us 

methane a primary component of natural gas and co 2  which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases the epa regulates the greenhouse gas emissions and requires the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the us for emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources fractionated ngl and the production of naturally occurring co 2  like our mcelmo dome co 2  field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere 

because our operations including our compressor stations and natural gas processing plants in our natural gas pipelines segment emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and co 2  such regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and could require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and such increased costs could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells which could adversely impact kmp’s and epb’s revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on their natural gas pipelines 

the natural gas industry is increasingly relying on natural gas supplies from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of natural gas from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise 

restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of natural gas and in turn adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines several of which gather gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent 

we may face competition from other pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil petroleum products or natural gas into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us 

cost overruns and delays on our expansion and new build projects could adversely affect our business    

kmp epb and our other pipelines regularly undertake major construction projects to expand their existing assets and to construct new assets a variety of factors outside of their control such as weather natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals as well as performance by thirdparty contractors has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows 

we must either obtain the right from landowners or exercise the power of eminent domain in order to use most of the land on which our pipelines are constructed and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use 

we obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land for a period of time if we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines our business could be negatively affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners primarily through rental increases and renewals of expired agreements 

whether kmp epb or our other pipelines have the power of eminent domain for their pipelines other than interstate natural gas pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipelinepetroleum liquids natural gas co 2 or crude oil—and the laws of the particular state our interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority in either case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court our inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect our subsidiaries’ business if they were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which pipelines are located 

kmp’s and epb’s acquisition strategies and expansion programs require access to new capital limitations on their access to capital would impair our ability to grow    

consistent with the terms of kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements kmp and epb distribute most of the cash generated by their operations as a result they have relied on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund acquisition and growth capital expenditures however to the extent our limited partnerships are unable to continue to finance growth externally their cash distribution policy will significantly impair their ability to grow kmp andor epb may need new capital to finance these activities limitations on access to capital whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise will impair their ability to execute this strategy 

kmp’s and epb’s growth strategies may cause difficulties integrating and constructing new operations and they may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from any future acquisitions    

part of kmp’s and epb’s business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses expanding existing assets and constructing new facilities if they do not successfully integrate acquisitions expansions or newly constructed facilities anticipated operating advantages and cost savings may not occur the integration of companies that have previously operated separately involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in its size after an acquisition expansion or completed construction project ii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of 

daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting estimating reporting and other systems iv difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees and v potential adverse effects on operating results 

our limited partnerships may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition expansion or construction project will depend upon their ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations cost savings and other sizerelated benefits they expected may not be achieved which could harm their financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 34 billion of consolidated debt including kmp and epb but excluding debt fair value adjustments this level of debt could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iii placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and iv increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our debt will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness or any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions which may include reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 8 billion 25 of our approximately 34 billion consolidated debt including kmp and epb but excluding debt fair value adjustments was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm debt of variable rate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs    

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

there is the potential for a change of control of the general partners of kmp and epb if we default on debt  

we own all of the common equity of the general partners of kmp and epb if we default on debt then the lenders under such debt in exercising their rights as lenders could acquire control of the general partners of kmp and epb through their control of us a change of control of the general partners of kmp and epb could materially adversely affect the distributions we receive from kmp and epb which could have a material adverse impact on us or our cash available for dividends to our stockholders 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities and reducing 

our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions also disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any reduction in our credit ratings could negatively impact the credit ratings of our subsidiaries which could increase their cost of capital and negatively affect their business and operating results although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments as well as the market value of kmp’s and epb’s common units 

current or future distressed financial conditions of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide     

some of our customers are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities in addition such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events or the threat of them may adversely affect our business  

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems or operating systems and may affect our ability to operate or control our pipeline assets our operations could be disrupted andor customer information could be stolen the occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to reputation increased regulation or litigation and or inaccurate information reported from our operations 

there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our pipelines business is dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities transported by our pipelines 

our pipelines depend on production of natural gas oil and other products in the areas served by our pipelines without reserve additions production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our gas plants and pipelines may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourages producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as a decline in crude oil or natural gas prices an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices supply disruptions or higher development costs could result in a slowing of supply from oil and natural gas producing areas in addition changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil and natural gas each of these factors impact our customers shipping through our pipelines which in turn could impact the prospects of new transportation contracts or renewals of existing contracts 

throughput on kmp’s andor epb’s pipelines also may decline as a result of changes in business conditions over the long term business will depend in part on the level of demand for oil natural gas and refined petroleum products in the geographic areas in which deliveries are made by pipelines and the ability and willingness of shippers having access or rights to utilize the pipelines to supply such demand 

the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel 

conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products 

the future success of kmp’s oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon its ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves and revenues of the oil and gas producing assets within the co 2 kmp business segment will decline kmp may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if kmp does not realize production volumes greater than or equal to its hedged volumes it may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

kmp’s development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

the volatility of natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on the co 2 kmp business segment 

the revenues profitability and future growth of the co 2 kmp business segment and the carrying value of its oil ngl and natural gas properties depend to a large degree on prevailing oil and gas prices for 2014 kmp estimates that every 1 change in the average wti crude oil price per barrel would impact the co 2 kmp segment’s cash flows by approximately 7 million prices for oil ngl and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond kmp’s control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political stability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil ngl or natural gas would result in a commensurate reduction in kmp’s revenues income and cash flows from the production of oil ngl and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of kmp’s proved reserves in the event prices fall substantially kmp may not be able to realize a profit from its production and would operate at a loss in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about our energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskenergy commodity market risk” 

our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not always possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely mitigate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the commodities futures trading commission referred to as the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the cftc has proposed new rules pursuant to the doddfrank act that would institute broad new aggregate position limits for otc swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the doddfrank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us the doddfrank act and any related regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the kinder morgan canadakmp segment is subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of the kinder morgan canadakmp business segment a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the us and canada volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil and ngl will have a negative impact on the results of the co 2 kmp business segment if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

kmp’s and epb’s tax treatment depends on their status as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes as well as not being subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation by individual states if kmp andor epb were treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes or if they were to become subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation for state tax purposes then cash available for distribution to their partners including us would be substantially reduced   

we own the general partner interests in both kmp and epb and approximately 11 and 41 of the limited partner interests of kmp and of epb respectively the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of our investment in kmp and epb depends largely on their treatment as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes neither kmp nor epb has requested nor plans to request a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter 

despite the fact that kmp and epb are organized as limited partnerships under delaware law it is possible in certain circumstances for partnerships such as kmp or epb to be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes although neither kmp nor epb believes based on its current operations that it is or will be so treated the irs could disagree with the positions kmp or epb takes or a change in kmp’s or epb’s business or a change in current law could cause them to be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject them to taxation as an entity 

if they were treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes they would pay us federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate which is currently a maximum of 35 and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates distributions by kmp and epb to their partners including us would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends to the extent of their current and accumulated earnings and profits and no income gains losses deductions or credits would flow through to their partners including us because tax would be imposed on kmp and epb as corporations their aftertax cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced likely causing a substantial reduction in the dividends we could pay and in the value of our common stock 

the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships including kmp and epb or an investment in them may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time moreover from time to time members of the us congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that could affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 

in addition because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entitylevel taxation through the imposition of state income franchise or other forms of taxation any state income taxes imposed upon kmp or epb as entities would reduce their cash available to be distributed to us any modification to the us federal income or state tax laws or interpretations thereof may be applied retroactively and could negatively impact the value of our investment in kmp and epb 

kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements provide that if a law is enacted that subjects them to corporate taxation or otherwise subjects them to entitylevel taxation for us federal income tax purposes the minimum quarterly distribution amounts and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact 

if kmp’s or epb’s unitholders remove their respective general partner we would lose our general partner interest in either kmp or epb including the right to incentive distributions and the ability to manage them 

we own the general partners of kmp and epb and with respect to kmp all of the voting shares of kmr to which the general partner has delegated its rights and powers to control the business and affairs of kmp subject to the approval of the general partner for certain actions kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements however give their respective unitholders the right to remove their general partner if i the holders of 66 2⁄3 of the respective partnership’s outstanding units including the common units class b units and iunits as applicable voting as a single class vote for such removal ii the holders of kmp’s and epb’s outstanding units approve the election and succession of a new general partner by the same vote respectively and 

iii kmp and or epb receives opinion of counsel that the removal and succession of the general partner would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any limited partner or its operating partnership subsidiaries or cause either kmp or epb or its operating partnership subsidiaries to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

if kmp’s or epb’s unitholders removed their respective general partner the general partner would lose its ability to manage kmp or epb and with respect to kmp the delegation of authority to kmr by kmp’s general partner would terminate at the same time the general partner would receive cash or common units in exchange for its general partner interest while the cash or common units the general partner would receive are intended under the terms of kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements to fully compensate us as the owner of the general partner in the event such an exchange is required the value of the investments we might make with the cash or the common units may not over time be equivalent to the value of the general partner interest and the related incentive distributions had the general partner retained its general partner interest 

if in the future kmr and the general partner cease to manage and control kmp with respect to kmp and epb’s general partner ceases to manage and control epb either limited partnership may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 

if our subsidiaries kmr and kmgp which is the general partner of kmp cease to manage and control kmp or el paso pipeline gp llc ceases to manage and control epb either or both kmp and epb may be deemed to be investment companies under the investment company act of 1940 in that case kmp andor epb would either have to register as an investment company under the investment company act obtain exemptive relief from the sec or modify their organizational structure or contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company registering as an investment company could among other things materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our growth may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly our chairman and chief executive officer richard d kinder who is also one of our founders along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder has been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy since 1997 if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the price of the common stock may be volatile and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investments 

the market price of the common stock could be volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the common stock due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for the common stock include i changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding the common stock the common units of kmp and epb other companies comparable to us or kmp and epb or companies in the industries we serve ii actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects iii reaction to our public announcements iv strategic actions taken by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings v the recruitment or departure of key personnel vi new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations vii changes in tax or accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles viii adverse conditions in the financial markets or general us or international economic conditions including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism and responses to such events ix sales of common stock by us members of our management team or significant stockholders and x the extent of analysts’ interest in following our company 

nonus holders of our common stock may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on the disposition of our common stock 

if we are or have been a ‘’us real property holding corporation’’ within the meaning of the code at any time within the shorter of i the fiveyear period preceding a disposition of our common stock by a nonus holder or ii such holder’s holding period for such common stock and assuming our common stock is ‘’regularly traded’’ as defined by applicable us treasury regulations on an established securities market the nonus holder may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on such disposition if it held more than 5 of our common stock during the shorter of periods i and ii above we believe we are or may become a us real property holding corporation 

risks related to our dividend policy 

holders of our common stock may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under our dividend policy or any dividends at all 

our dividend policy provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends generally representing the cash we receive from our subsidiaries less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes however our board of directors subject to the requirements of our bylaws and other governance documents may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and even while the current policy is in place the actual amount of dividends on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities capital requirements of our subsidiaries legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors dividends other than as provided in our dividend policy require supermajority board approval while the sponsor investors maintain prescribed ownership thresholds 

over time our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs which could affect whether we pay dividends and the amount of any dividends we may pay in the future the terms of any future indebtedness we incur also may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our stock under certain circumstances a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result if our board of directors establishes large reserves that reduce the amount of quarterly dividends paid or if we reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

the general partners of kmp and epb with our consent but without the consent of our stockholders may take steps to support kmp and epb that have the effect of reducing cash we have or are entitled to receive thereby reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends 

we utilize kmp and epb as our vehicles for growth we have historically received a significant portion of our cash flows from incentive distributions on the general partner interest as the owner of the general partner of kmp and now epb we may take steps we judge beneficial to kmp’s and epb’s growth that in the shortrun reduce the cash we receive and have available to pay dividends the board of directors of the general partner of kmp or epb may determine to support a desirable acquisition that may not be immediately accretive to cash available for distribution per kmp or epb unit for example kmp’s general partner with our consent waived its incentive distributions from the second quarter of 2010 through 2011 on common units issued to finance a portion of kmp’s acquisition of the initial 50 interest in the kinderhawk joint venture and has agreed to waive its paid incentive distributions of 27 million and 4 million for 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 respectively on common units issued to finance a portion of kmp’s subsequent acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in the kinderhawk joint venture in addition in connection with kmp’s acquisition of copano kmp’s general partner has agreed to waive incentive distributions of 75 million for 2013 120 million for both 2014 and 2015 110 million for 2016 and annual amounts thereafter decreasing by 5 million per year from this level 

our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities above the limited partnership level or impair our financial flexibility 

if we pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities above the limited partnership level meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements or fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn in addition because of the dividends required under our dividend policy our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business above the limited partnership level including through acquisitions increased capital spending or other increases of our expenditures will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing we cannot assure our stockholders that such financing will be available to 

us at all or at an acceptable cost if we are unable to take timely advantage of growth opportunities our future financial condition and competitive position may be harmed which in turn may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to pay dividends 

all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries and our cash flow and our ability to satisfy obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries in addition our joint ventures and some of our subsidiaries such as our limited partnerships are not wholly owned by us when funds are distributed to us by such joint ventures and subsidiaries funds also will be distributed to their other owners 

each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and has no obligation to transfer funds to us a number of our subsidiaries are a party to credit facilities and are or may in the future be a party to other borrowing agreements that restrict the payment of dividends to us and such subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions will depend on their respective operating results and may be subject to further restrictions under among other things the laws of their jurisdiction of organization 

the board of directors of kmr which is the delegate of kmp’s general partner and epb’s general partner have broad authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of their businesses the establishment of those reserves could result in smaller distributions to us and a corresponding reduction of our cash available for dividends and our anticipated dividend level further the calculation of kmp’s and epb’s available cash for distribution is discretionary and subject to the approval of the board of directors of kmr or epb’s general partner respectively taking into consideration their constituent agreements similarly while the constituent agreements of ngpl provide that it is the intention of ngpl to make distributions of available cash we own less than a majority of ngpl and do not control it the same is true for joint ventures in which our limited partnerships own an interest 

the distributions we receive from kmp are largely attributable to the incentive distributions on our general partner interest the distributions we receive are not as large if kmp distributes cash from interim capital transactions rather than cash from operations or if kmp’s general partner waives receipt of a portion of those incentive distributions 

as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to receive cash through distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries in sufficient amounts to pay dividends on our common stock if we are unable to authorize the payment of dividends due to insufficient cash a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

our ability to pay dividends is restricted by delaware law 

under the dgcl our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of surplus as calculated in accordance with the dgcl or if we do not have a surplus it is paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year our bylaws require the declaration and payment of dividends to comply with the dgcl if as a result of these restrictions we are unable to authorize payment of dividends a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders 

risks related to conflicts of interest 

kmp epb and their subsidiaries may compete with us 

neither of kmp epb or any of their subsidiaries or entities in which they own an interest is restricted from competing with us kmr manages kmp subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of kmp’s general partner and epb’s general partner manages epb in what they consider to be the best interests of their respective limited partner interests kmp epb and their subsidiaries may acquire invest in or construct assets that may be in direct competition with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects among other things we and our limited partnerships have a policy that acquisition opportunities of businesses or operating assets will be pursued above the limited partnership level only if kmp and epb elect not to pursue the opportunity 

many of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries including kmr and epb or entities in which we own an interest such as ngpl as a result of which conflicts of interest exist and will arise in the future 

many of our directors and officers are also directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries any officer or director of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries who is also a director or officer of ours in making decisions in such person’s capacity as our officer or director is required to act in accordance with his or her fiduciary duties to us however in making decisions in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of one of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries or such other entities such person may make a decision that favors the interests of such subsidiary over our interests or the interests of our stockholders and may be to our detriment further the organizational documents of these entities may have provisions reducing or eliminating the duties of their officers or directors to those entities and their owners including us in addition our directors are not required to work full time on our business and affairs and may devote significant time to the affairs of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries there could be material competition for the time and effort of our directors who provide services to our nonwholly owned subsidiaries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following i a description of our business strategy found in items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—business strategy” ii a description of developments during 2013 found in items 1 and 2 “business and properties—a general development of business—recent developments” and iii a description of risk factors affecting us and our business found in item 1a “risk factors” 

we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap accordingly as discussed in notes 1 “general” 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements our financial statements reflect the reclassifications necessary to reflect the results of kmp’s ftc natural gas pipelines disposal group as discontinued operations we sold kmp’s ftc natural gas pipelines disposal group to tallgrass effective november 1 2012 for approximately 18 billion in cash before selling costs or 33 billion including kmp’s share of joint venture debt in 2013 kmp and tallgrass trued up the final consideration for the sale of kmp’s ftc natural gas pipelines disposal group and based both on this true up and certain incremental selling expenses kmp paid in 2013 we recognized an additional 4 million loss related to our sale of the disposal group except for this loss amount we recorded no other financial results from the operations of the disposal group during 2013 furthermore we have excluded the disposal group’s financial results from the natural gas pipelines business segment disclosures for each of the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

inasmuch as the discussion below and the other sections to which we have referred you pertain to management’s comments on financial resources capital spending our business strategy and the outlook for our business such discussions contain forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements reflect the expectations beliefs plans and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management’s judgment concerning the matters discussed and accordingly involve estimates assumptions judgments and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this report particularly in item 1a “risk factors” and at the beginning of this report in “information regarding forwardlooking statements” 

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal components 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

our reportable business segments are 

 57 

processing and treating facilities and iii the ownership andor operation of ngl fractionation facilities and transportation systems 

 

 

 

 

   

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the us’ and canada’s various energy businesses and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly in kmp’s texas intrastate natural gas group it currently derives approximately 75 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts that include requirements with minimum volume payment obligations as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2013 the remaining average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ purchase and sales contracts was approximately five and a half years 

during 2012 and 2013 we further expanded our midstream services through our i ep midstream asset operations which we acquired 50 from kkr effective june 1 2012 and 50 from the may 25 2012 ep acquisition and ii our copano operations which included the remaining 50 ownership interest in eagle ford gathering llc that we did not already own and which was acquired effective may 1 2013 these feebased gathering processing and fractionation assets along with our financial strength and extensive pipeline transportation and storage assets should provide an excellent platform to further grow our midstream services footprint the revenues and earnings we realize from gathering natural gas processing natural gas in order to remove ngl from the natural gas stream and fractionating ngl into their base components are also affected by the volumes of natural gas made available to our systems which are primarily driven by levels of natural gas drilling activity our midstream services are provided pursuant to a variety of arrangements generally categorized by the nature of the commodity price risk as feebased percentofproceeds percentofindex and keepwhole contracts may rely solely on a single type of arrangement but more often they combine elements of two or more of the above which helps us and our counterparties manage the extent to which each shares in the potential risks and benefits of changing commodity prices 

the co 2  sales and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2013 had a remaining average contract life of approximately ten years co 2  sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2014 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2014 budget approximately 69 of our contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee or floor price and 31 fluctuate with the price of 

oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2 kmp business segment is driven by the demand for co 2  however shortterm changes in the demand for co 2  typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2 kmp business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil ngl and co 2  sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was   9270 per barrel in 2013 8772 per barrel in 2012 and 6973 per barrel in 2011 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged   9494 per barrel in 2013 8991 per barrel in 2012 and 9261 per barrel in 2011 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

  

the factors impacting the terminalskmp business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums because these contracts are volume based above the minimums our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

in 2013 kmi completed the dropdown of its remaining 50 interest in epng and its 50 interest in the ep midstream assets to kmp kmi used proceeds from the dropdown transaction to i pay down 947 million of kmi’s senior secured term loan facility and ii reduce borrowings under kmi’s credit facility in 2014 kmi expects to dropdown its 50 interest in ruby pipeline holding company llc its 50 interest in gulf lng holdings group llc and its 475 interest in young gas storage company ltd to epb kmp and epb have a successful history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses 

thus the amount that we are able to increase dividends to our shareholders will to some extent be a function of our and our subsidiaries’ ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions including dropdown transactions we believe we will continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets and we have budgeted approximately 39 billion for our 2014 capital expansion program including small acquisitions and investment contributions we and our subsidiaries kmp and epb regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions including those from us or our affiliates and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions 

based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such 

transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations furthermore our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost and includes factors over which we have limited or no control thus we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 

our or our subsidiaries’ including epb and kmp ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand our assets is impacted by our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions as mlps kmp and epb distribute all of their available cash and they access capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions historically kmp and epb have succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund their acquisitions and expansions and although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit we believe that kmp’s and epb’s stable cash flows credit ratings and historical records of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment distribution and acquisition strategies as well as refinance maturing debt when required for a further discussion of our liquidity including kmp’s and epb’s public debt and equity offerings in 2013 please see “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

in addition a portion of kmp’s business portfolio including the kinder morgan canadakmp business segment the canadian portion of kmp’s cochin pipeline and the bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currencybased transactions both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates to help understand our reported operating results all of the following references to “foreign currency effects” or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results in us dollars resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar the references are made to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of gaap involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets and related depletion rates ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

  

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

acquisition method of accounting   

for acquired businesses we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values with limited exceptions on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount 

rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on environmental matters see item 1c for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

legal matters 

  

many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to legal and regulatory matters as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred when we identify contingent liabilities we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to resolve the matter generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected 

  

as of december 31 2013 our most significant ongoing legal matters involved kmp’s west coast products pipelines and its western interstate natural gas pipelines transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines’ interstate and intrastate california rates respectively for more information on regulatory proceedings see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year there were no impairment charges resulting from our may 31 2013 impairment testing and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date furthermore our analysis as of that date did not reflect any reporting units at risk and subsequent to that date no event has occurred indicating that the implied fair value of each of our reporting units is less than the carrying value of its net assets for more information on our goodwill see notes 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” and 7 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements 

  

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for more information on our amortizable intangibles see note 7 “goodwill and other intangibles” to our consolidated financial statements 

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves please see “supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities unaudited” 

  

hedging activities 

  

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of gaap to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately we may or may not apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts depending on the circumstances all of our derivative contracts are recorded at estimated fair value 

  

since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity pricesa perfectly effective hedgewe often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for example when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations accordingly our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges for more information on our hedging activities see note 13 “risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2013 our pension plans were underfunded by 230 million  and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by 251 million  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we select our discount rates by matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to the average yields of various highquality bonds with corresponding maturities the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 9 “sharebased compensation and employee benefits” to our consolidated financial statements 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants we record these deferred amounts as either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations as of december 31 2013 we had deferred net losses of approximately 27 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2013 

income taxes 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

  

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments including our investment in kmp and epb the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investment in kmp and epb 

  

going private transaction 

  

a going private transaction completed in may 2007 was accounted for as a purchase business combination accordingly our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the going private transaction with the excess of the purchase price over these combined fair values recorded as goodwill 

results of operations 

nongaap measures 

the nongaap financial measures of i cash available to pay dividends both in the aggregate and per share and ii segment ebda and certain items are presented below under   “—cash available to pay dividends”   and   “—consolidated earnings results”    certain items are items that are required by gaap to be reflected in net income but typically either do not have a cash impact or by their nature are separately identifiable from our normal business operations and in our view are likely to occur only sporadically 

we believe the gaap measure most directly comparable to cash available to pay dividends is income from continuing operations a reconciliation of cash available to pay dividends to income from continuing operations is provided below under “—reconciliation of cash available to pay dividends to income from continuing operation” our nongaap measures below should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income or any other gaap measure cash available to pay dividends and segment ebda and certain items are not financial measures in accordance with gaap and have important limitations as analytical tools you should not consider these nongaap measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap our computation of cash available to pay dividends and segment ebda and certain items may differ from similarly titled measures used by others management compensates for the limitations of these nongaap measures by reviewing our comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and taking this information into account in its analysis and its decision making processes 

cash available to pay dividends 

our board of directors has adopted the dividend policy set forth in our shareholders’ agreement which provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our capital stock equal to the cash we receive from our subsidiaries and other sources less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes see a further discussion on kmi dividends below under “— financial condition— kmi dividends” the calculation of our cash available to pay dividends and a reconciliation of this nongaap measure to income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is as follows 



 

 65 

units outstanding as of july 31 2013 and 2012 respectively iv 218 million and 216 million outstanding as of october 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and v 218 million and 216 million common units outstanding as of january 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

 



 

 66 

 

consolidated earnings results 

with regard to our reportable business segments we consider segment earnings before all dda expenses and amortization of excess cost of equity investments defined in the “results of operations” tables below and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our shareholders we also use segment ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our six reportable business segments ebda may not be comparable to measures used by other companies additionally ebda should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income income from continuing operations or operating cash flows 

  



 

 

year ended december 31 2013 vs 2012 

our total revenues for 2013 and 2012 were 141 billion and 100 billion respectively income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled 3438 million for 2013 as compared to 1343 million in 2012 

our income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding income taxes allocated to segment earnings see footnote a increased by 2095 million 156 from 1343 million in 2012 to 3438 million in 2013 however this increase included a 1256 million increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from the combined effect of the certain items referenced in footnotes b c and d in the above table 

the remaining 839 million 39 increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes was primarily due to better overall performance from our segments in 2013 driven by the natural gas pipelines segment primarily due to a full year of contributions from the ep operations including epb 

year ended december 31 2012 vs 2011 

  

our total revenues for 2012 and 2011 were 100 billion and 79 billion respectively income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled 1343 million for 2012 as compared to 810 million in 2011 

our income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding income taxes allocated to segment earnings see footnote a increased by 533 million 66 from 810 million in 2011 to 1343 million in 2012 however this increase included a 292 million pretax decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from the combined effect of the certain items referenced in footnotes b c and d in the above table 

after adjusting for these items the remaining 825 million 63 increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes was primarily due to better performance in 2012 from all reportable business segments driven mainly by increases attributable to the natural gas pipelines due to contributions from the ep operations including epb the co2kmp and the terminalskmp business segments 

impact of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss 

  

the impacts of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss before dda relate primarily to the revaluation of the accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives accounted for as hedges in the co 2 —kmp and natural gas pipelines segments where there is an impact to segment earnings loss before dda from the going private transaction the impact is described in the individual business segment discussions which follow the effects on dda expense result from changes in the carrying values of certain tangible and intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 this revaluation results in changes to dda expense in periods subsequent to may 30 2007 the purchase accounting effects on “unallocable interest and other net” result principally from the revaluation of certain debt instruments to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 resulting in changes to interest expense in subsequent periods 

  

segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses 

  

certain items included in earnings from continuing operations are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance in general the items not included in segment results are interest expense general and administrative expenses dda and unallocable income taxes these items are not controllable by our business segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate servicesincluding accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment earnings before dda in relation to the level of capital employed because kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements require them to distribute 100 of their available cash to their partners on a quarterly basis kmp’s and epb’s available cash consists primarily of all of its cash receipts less cash disbursements and changes in reserves we consider each period’s earnings before all noncash dda expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our segments that are also segments of kmp we account for intersegment sales at market prices we account for the transfer of net assets between entities under common control by carrying forward the net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination transfers of net assets between entities under common control do not affect the income statement of the combined entity 

natural gas pipelines 

  



 

 

the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above accounted for a 1625 million increase in our natural gas pipelines business segment’s ebda including discontinued operations in 2013 and a 961 million decrease in segment ebda in 2012 when compared to the respective prior year the certain items also accounted for a   16 million decrease in segment revenues including discontinued operations in 2013 when compared to 2012 following is information including discontinued operations related to the segment’s remaining i 1174 million 46 and 1574 million 162 increases in ebda and ii 3176 million 58 increase and 1192 million 28 increase in revenues in 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year

na – not applicable 

 

the significant increases and decreases in the natural gas pipelines business segment’s ebda in the comparable years of 2012 and 2011 included the following 

 

the overall yeartoyear decrease in ebda from discontinued operations was largely due to the loss of income due to the sale of our discontinued operations effective november 1 2012 ebda from the kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system the trailblazer pipeline system and kmp’s investment in the rockies express pipeline system decreased 29 million 33 20 million 59 and 17 million 19 respectively in 2012 versus 2011 in addition to the loss of income due to our divestiture earnings from both pipeline systems decreased during the ten months we owned the assets in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the decrease was driven by lower revenues in 2012 generally related to lower net fuel recoveries lower margins on operational natural gas sales and excess natural gas transportation capacity existing out of the rocky mountain region relative to 2011 

co 2 —kmp   



 

 

the co 2 —kmp segment’s primary businesses involve the production marketing and transportation of both co 2  and crude oil and the production and marketing of natural gas and ngl we refer to the segment’s two primary businesses as its oil and gas producing activities and sales and transportation activities 

  

combined the certain items described in footnotes a and b to the table above accounted for a 7 million increase in segment ebda in 2013 and a 27 million decrease in segment ebda in 2012 when compared to the respective prior year the certain items also accounted for a 14 million increase in segment revenues in 2013 and a 34 million decrease in segment revenues in 2012 when compared to the respective prior year for each of the segment’s two primary businesses following is information related to the remaining i 106 million 8 and 232 million 21 increases in ebda and ii 166 million 10 and 277 million 20 increases in revenues in both 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year 

year ended december 31 2013 versus year ended december 31 2012 

  



the segment’s oil and gas producing activities include the operations associated with its ownership interests in oilproducing fields and natural gas processing plants when compared to 2012 the increase in earnings from the segment’s oil and gas producing activities in 2013 was mainly due to the following 

 

 

 

ebda from the segment’s sales and transportation activities increased by 32 million 9 in 2013 versus 2012 the yeartoyear increase in earnings was driven by i higher co 2 sales revenues due to an almost 10 increase in average sales prices ii higher reimbursable project revenues largely related to the completion of prior expansion projects on the central basin pipeline system and iii higher third party storage revenues at the yates field unit 



when compared to 2011 the increase in earnings from the segment’s oil and gas producing activities in 2012 was mainly due to the following 

 

 

 

the increase in ebda from the segment’s sales and transportation activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily revenue related attributable to the following 

  

 

 

products pipelines—kmp 

  



 

 

combined the certain items described in footnote a to the table above accounted for a 147 million decrease in segment ebda in 2013 and a 198 million increase in segment ebda in 2012 when compared with the respective prior year following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 81 million 12 and 9 million 1 increases in ebda and ii 483 million 35 and 456 million 50 increases in revenues in both 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year

na  not applicable 

the primary increases and decreases in the products pipelines—kmp business segment’s ebda in 2012 compared to 2011 were attributable to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminals—kmp 

  

 

 

the terminals—kmp business segment includes the operations of petroleum chemical and other liquids terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines—kmp segment and all of coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk material services facilities kmp groups its bulk and liquids terminal operations into regions based on geographic location andor primary operating function this structure allows the management to organize and evaluate segment performance and to help make operating decisions and allocate resources 

  

combined the certain items described in footnote a to the table above accounted for a 82 million increase in segment ebda in 2013 a 45 million decrease in segment ebda in 2012 and an 8 million increase in segment revenues in 2013 when compared with the respective prior year following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 46 million 6 and 51 million 7 increases in ebda and ii 43 million 3 and 44 million 3 increases in revenues in both 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year 

  

  



the overall increase in the terminals—kmp’s ebda in 2013 versus 2012 was driven by incremental contributions from its gulf liquids terminals due primarily to higher liquids revenues from its pasadena and galena park liquids facilities located along the houston ship channel the facilities benefited from high gasoline export demand increased rail services and new and incremental customer agreements at higher rates for all terminals included in the terminals—kmp business segment total liquids leaseable capacity increased to 681 mmbbl at yearend 2013 up 127 from a capacity of   604 mmbbl at the end of 2012 the increase in capacity was mainly due to the acquisition of kmp’s norfolk and chesapeake virginia facilities from allied terminals in june 2013 incremental contributions from these two terminals are included within the “acquired assets and businesses” line in the two tables above and the partial inservice of bostco and edmonton tank expansion projects at the same time kmp’s overall liquids utilization rate increased   18 since the end of 2012 

the rivers region earnings and revenues increased due to the inservice of the imt phase i and ii expansion projects at kmp’s international marine terminal located at myrtle grove louisiana near the mouth of the mississippi river the region also benefited from lower operating and maintenance costs 

much of the midwest’s improvement comes from the opening in august 2013 of the bp whiting terminal whiting indiana salt and ethanol increases account for the rest of the improvement 

the periodtoperiod increases in earnings from kmp’s northeast terminal operations were driven by incremental contributions from kmp’s carteret new jersey liquids facility and kmp’s perth amboy new jersey liquids terminal carteret benefited from both higher nonoperating income due to insurance indemnifications received for 2012 business interruptions caused by hurricane sandy and higher revenues due in part to new and restructured customer agreements at higher rates kmp’s perth amboy terminal benefited from higher yearoveryear revenues due mainly to additional and restructured customer contracts at higher rates 

earnings from kmp’s midatlantic terminals were flat across both 2013 and 2012 as higher earnings from its fairless hills pennsylvania bulk terminal were offset by lower earnings and revenues from its pier ix terminal located in newport news virginia the earnings increase from fairless hills was primarily due to higher margins and volumes from steel and fertilizer transfers driven by rebounding manufacturing and agricultural demand in the last half of 2013 as well as fertilizer expansion projects coming online the decreases in revenues and earnings from pier ix were due primarily to an 8 drop in coal transfer volumes due largely to some weakening in the coal export market relative to 2012 and due partly to scheduled maintenance at the facility in the second quarter of 2013 

the remaining increases and decreases in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings and revenues reported in the “all others” line in the table above represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations however the overall decreases across the comparable years were due in large part to i the loss of business effective march 31 2013 when transflo a wholly owned subsidiary of csx elected to terminate their contract with kmp’s materials handling whollyowned subsidiary kinder morgan materials services kmms and ii higher income tax expense 



the overall increase in ebda from the terminals—kmp business segment in 2012 compared to 2011was driven by higher contributions from the terminal facilities included in the gulf liquids midatlantic and northeast regions the increase from the gulf liquids facilities was driven by higher warehousing revenues as a result of new and renewed customer agreements at higher rates at the galena park and pasadena texas facilities higher ethanol volumes through the deer park texas rail terminal and higher overall gasoline throughput volumes kmp also benefited from both higher capitalized overhead associated with the ongoing construction of kmp’s majorityowned battleground oil specialty terminal company llc terminal located on the houston ship channel and higher earnings from its crude oil storage operations located in cushing oklahoma 

the yeartoyear earnings increase from the midatlantic region resulted primarily from higher export coal shipments from the pier ix terminal and higher import steel and iron ore imports from the fairless hills pennsylvania bulk terminal economic expansion in developing countries generated a growth cycle in the coal export market during 2012 and due both to this growth in demand and to completed infrastructure expansions since the end of 2011 kmp’s total export coal volumes for all terminals combined increased by 57 million tons 38 in 2012 when compared to the prior year 

the increase in earnings from the northeast terminal operations was driven by higher contributions from the staten island terminal due mainly to new and favorable contract changes despite being affected heavily by hurricane sandy in 2012 the liquids terminal in carteret new jersey increased earnings primarily due to higher transfer and storage rates and to new and renegotiated contracts kmp also benefited from incremental earnings from the philadelphia liquids terminal due largely to new and restructured customer contracts at higher rates and from the perth amboy new jersey liquids terminal due primarily to higher gasoline throughput volumes and favorable contract changes 

the incremental earnings and revenues from acquired assets and businesses primarily represent contributions from kmp’s additional equity investment in the shortline railroad operations of watco companies llc acquired in december 2011 and its bulk terminal acquired in june 2011 that handles petroleum coke for the total refinery located in port arthur texas the incremental amounts represent earnings and revenues from acquired terminals’ operations during the additional months of ownership in 2012 and do not include increases or decreases during the same months kmp owned the assets in 2011 

the remaining increases and decreases in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings and revenues—reported in the “all others” line in the table above—represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations however the overall decreases were driven by lower results from the combined terminal operations included in the rivers region the decreases were mainly due to lower domestic coal transload volumes largely the result of a drop in domestic demand relative to 2011 

kinder morgan canada—kmp 

  



 

 

the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment includes the operations of the trans mountain and jet fuel pipeline systems and until march 14 2013 the effective date of sale kmp’s onethird ownership interest in the express crude oil pipeline system combined the certain items described in footnote a to the table above accounted for a 140 million increase in segment ebda in 2013 and a 3 million decrease in segment ebda in 2012 when compared with the respective prior year 

  

following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 29 million 13 decrease and 30 million 15 increase in ebda in 2013 and 2012 and ii 9 million 3 decrease and 9 million 3 increase in revenues in 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year 

  



 

 

the periodtoperiod decreases in ebda from express were primarily due to both lower equity earnings and lower interest income resulting from the sale of kmp’s equity and debt investments in express effective march 14 2013 

the decreases in trans mountain’s earnings were driven by i higher income tax expenses due largely to general increases in british columbia’s income tax rates since the end of the third quarter of 2012 ii unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the canadian dollar since the end of 2012 kmp translated canadian denominated income and expense amounts into less us dollars in 2013 and iii lower management incentive fees earned from the operation of the express pipeline system due to its sale in march 2013 the periodtoperiod decreases in trans mountain’s earnings were partially offset by incremental nonoperating income from allowances for funds used during construction representing an estimate of the cost of capital funded by equity contributions 

  



the yeartoyear increase in trans mountain’s ebda was driven by a 17 million decrease in income tax expenses associated primarily with favorable tax adjustments recorded in 2012 related to lower taxable income relative to 2011 trans mountain also benefited from higher nonoperating income related primarily to incremental management incentive fees earned from its operation of the express pipeline system the yearoveryear increase in earnings from the equity investment in the express pipeline system was mainly due to volumes moving at higher transportation rates on the express canadian portion of the system and to higher domestic volumes on the platte domestic portion of the segment 

other 

our other segment activities include those operations that were acquired from ep on may 25 2012 and are primarily related to several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with ep’s legacy trading activities these contracts obligate ep to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028 this segment also included an interest in the bolivia to brazil pipeline which we sold for 88 million on january 18 2013 this segment contributed a loss of 5 million and earnings of 7 million for the years ended 2013 and 2012

combined the certain items described in footnotes a and b to the table above affected kmi’s general and administrative expenses by a 330 million decrease in 2013 and 253 million increase in 2012 when compared with the respective year the remaining changes in kmi’s general and administrative expense was essentially flat in both 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective year 

2013 and 2012 amounts also include 9 million and 43 million respectively of kmp expense attributable to kmp’s dropdown asset groups for the periods prior to the acquisition dates combined the certain items described in footnote c to the table above and the combined 34 million decrease in expense from the dropdown asset groups expense prior to the acquisition dates decreased kmp’s general and administrative expenses by 75 million in 2013 and increased its general and administrative expenses by 30 million in 2012 when compared with the respective prior year the remaining 88 million 21 and 44 million 12 increases in general and administrative expenses in 2013 and 2012 respectively were driven by the acquisition of additional businesses primarily associated with kmp’s acquisition of the dropdown asset groups from us effective august 1 2012 and march 1 2013 and for 2013 versus 2012 its acquisition of copano effective may 1 2013 kmp also realized higher yearoveryear employee benefits and payroll tax expenses due mainly to both cost inflation increases on workbased health and insurance benefits and higher wage rates 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount combined the certain items described in footnotes e and f to the table above affected our consolidated interest expense by a 77 million decrease in 2013 and a 107 million increase in 2012 when compared with the respective prior year our remaining consolidated interest expense net of interest income increased 324 million 24 and 633 million 90 respectively in 2013 and 2012 when compared with the respective prior year 

the increase in kmi’s interest expense in 2013 and 2012 compared to respective prior years was primarily due to interest expense incurred from i ep acquisition debt and ii debt assumed in the ep acquisition see notes 3 “acquisition and divestitures—kmi acquisition of el paso corporation” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements 

for kmp the 2013 and 2012 amounts also include 15 million and 69 million respectively of kmp expense attributable to kmp’s dropdown asset groups for the periods prior to the acquisition dates after taking into effect the certain items 

described in footnote f to the table above and the combined 54 million decrease in expense from the dropdown asset groups expense prior to the acquisition dates kmp’s unallocable interest expense increased 218 million 34 in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 101 million 19 in 2012 compared to 2011 for both pairs of comparable years the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher average borrowings and for 2013 compared to 2012 to higher effective interest rates kmp’s average debt balances increased 24 in 2013 and 23 in 2012 when compared to the respective prior year the increases in average borrowings were largely due to the capital expenditures business acquisitions including debt assumed from the dropdown transactions and joint venture contributions kmp has made since the beginning of 2011 for more information on the capital expenditures capital contributions and acquisition expenditures see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowings—including both shortterm and longterm amounts—increased by 9 in 2013 versus 2012 but was essentially flat across both 2012 and 2011 the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowings was 462 during 2013 424 during 2012 and 426 during 2011 the higher average rate in 2013 was driven primarily by higher interest rates on the debt obligations kmp assumed as part of the dropdown transactions 

we and our subsidiary kmp use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 approximately 27 of kmi’s and 29 of kmp’s debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps epb did not have variable rate debt obligations as of december 31 2013   as of december 31 2012 approximately 47 of kmi’s and 37 of kmp’s debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rates for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 13 “risk management—interest rate risk management” to our consolidated financial statements 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income or loss attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries primarily kmp and epb that are not held by us the 1387 million 1238 increase for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to our noncontrolling interest’s portion of i kmp’s 558 million gain from the remeasurement of its previously held 50 equity interest in eagle ford to fair value ii kmp’s 140 million aftertax gain on the sale of its investments in the express pipeline system iii kmp’s additional income from ep assets acquired by kmp from us iv kmp’s additional income from its acquisition of copano and v the 2012 noncash loss of 937 million net of tax loss from both costs to sell and the remeasurement of kmp’s ftc natural gas pipeline disposal group net assets to fair value the 46 million 70 increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to our noncontrolling interests portion of the additional income from acquisitions and partially offset by noncash loss of 937 million from both the costs to sell and a remeasurement of the ftc natural gas pipeline disposal group net assets to fair value 

  

income taxes—continuing operations 

  

year ended december 31 2013 versus year ended december 31 2012 

our tax expense for income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2013 was 742 million as compared with 2012 income tax expense of 139 million the 603 million increase in tax expense is due primarily to i higher income in 2013 attributable to kmi’s investments in kmp and epb as compared to 2012 and ii tax expense as a result of kmp’s 2013 sale of its onethird interest in the express pipeline system these increases are partially offset by a decrease in the deferred state tax rate as a result of the march 2013 dropdown transaction and kmp’s copano acquisition 

year ended december 31 2012 versus year ended december 31 2011 

our income tax expense for income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2012 was 139 million as compared with 2011 income tax expense of 361 million the 222 million decrease in tax expense is due primarily to i lower income attributable to kmi as a result of costs incurred in 2012 to facilitate the ep acquisition and a 200 million impairment of our ngpl investment and ii a 2012 adjustment to decrease our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions these decreases are partially offset by i a 2012 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability for a change in non taxdeductible goodwill related to our investment in kmp and ii the tax impact of an increase in the deferred state tax rate in 2012 as a result of the ep acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2013  we had a combined 598 million  of “cash and cash equivalents” a decrease of 116 million   16  from december 31 2012  we believe that our cash position and remaining borrowing capacity discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and our access to financial resources are adequate to allow us to manage our daytoday cash requirements and anticipated obligations 

  

we have relied primarily on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt interest payments sustaining capital expenditures those capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity or throughput quarterly dividend payments and our subsidiaries’ quarterly distributions 

  

expansion capital expenditures acquisitions and debt principal payments as such debt principal payments become due have historically been funded by us and our subsidiaries through i additional borrowings including commercial paper issuances by kmp ii the issuance of additional common stock by us iii issuance of shares by kmr with proceeds used for its purchase of additional kmp iunits iv issuance of common units by kmp or epb and v and in some instances proceeds from divestitures 

in addition kmp has funded a portion of its historical expansion capital expenditures with retained cash from including iunits owned by kmr in the determination of kmp’s cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on iunits in additional iunits rather than cash and from waived incentive distributions to kmgp kmp’s general partner additional information regarding kmp’s distributions and waived incentive distributions is discussed in note 10 “stockholders’ equity—noncontrolling interests—distributions—kmp distributions” 

  

in addition to results of operations our kmp and epb’s debt and capital balances are affected by financing activities as discussed below in “—financing activities” 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings affect our ability to access the public and private debt markets including the commercial paper market by kmp as well as the terms and pricing of our debt see part i item 1a “risk factors” based on our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings as discussed below we and our subsidiaries expect that our respective shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through shortterm borrowings nevertheless our and our subsidiaries’ ability to satisfy financing requirements or fund planned capital expenditures including our share of planned expenditures of our joint ventures will depend upon future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy pipeline and terminals industries and other financial and business factors some of which are beyond our control kmp’s shortterm corporate debt rating is a2 prime2 and f2 at standard and poor’s moody’s investor services and fitch ratings inc respectively 

 the following table represents kmi kmp and epb’s debt ratings as of december 31 2013 

  

    

 

a represents senior secured credit rating 

b represents senior unsecured credit rating 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2013 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are i kmi kmp and epb’s respective credit facilities discussed following ii kmp’s 27 billion  shortterm commercial paper program and iii cash from operations the loan commitments under the facilities can be used to fund borrowings for the respective entity’s general corporate or partnership purposes and kmp’s facility can be used as a backup for its commercial paper program we provide for liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our credit facilities and have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 4064 million  and 2795 million  in 2013 and 2012 respectively the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “cash flows—operating activities” 

  

the following represents our primary revolving credit facilities that were available to kmi and its subsidiaries kmp and epb debt outstanding under the credit facilities including commercial paper borrowings and available borrowing capacity under the facilities after deducting i outstanding letters of credit and ii outstanding borrowings under kmi and epb’s credit facilities and kmp’s commercial paper program supported by its credit facility 



our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2013 was 2306 million  primarily consisting of i 1154 million  combined outstanding borrowings under kmi’s 175 billion  credit facility and kmp’s 27 billion  commercial paper program ii 500 million  in principal amount of kmp’s 5125  senior notes that mature november 15 2014 iii a combined 193 million  of borrowings outstanding under ep credit facilities and iv 207 million  in principal amount of ep’s 6875  senior notes that mature on june 15 2014 kmp intends to refinance its current shortterm debt through a combination of longterm debt equity andor the issuance of additional commercial paper or credit facility borrowings to replace maturing commercial paper and current maturities of longterm debt kmi intends to refinance its shortterm debt through additional credit facility borrowings to replace maturing credit facility borrowings issuing new longterm debt or with proceeds from asset sales our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2012 was 2401 million  

  

we had working capital deficits of 2207 million  and 1554 million  as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the overall 653 million   42  unfavorable change from yearend 2012 was primarily due to i an increase in “accrued contingencies” due largely to certain kmp transportation rate case liabilities being reclassified from longterm liabilities to shortterm liabilities ii a net increase in kmp’s commercial paper borrowings iii a net increase in kmi and its subsidiaries excluding kmp and epb and its subsidiaries’ current maturities and iv the sale in 2013 of our investment in bbpp holdings ltda and kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system which were included at december 31 2012  within “assets held for sale” the overall increase in our working capital deficit was partially offset by a net decrease in kmi’s credit facility borrowings generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in our combined cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our or our subsidiaries’ debt or equity issuances discussed below in “—longterm financing” 

kmp and epb each employ centralized cash management programs for their usbased bank accounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of their operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing these programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of their operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other 

entities within their consolidated group kmp and epb place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities however kmp and epb’s cash and the cash of their subsidiaries are not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in our consolidated group of companies and kmi has no rights with respect to kmp and epb’s cash except as permitted pursuant to their respective partnership agreements 

furthermore certain of kmp and epb’s operating subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

  

from time to time kmi kmp or epb issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of the senior notes of kmi kmp or epb issued to date other than those issued by kmp and epb’s subsidiaries and its operating partnerships generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums kmi and its subsidiaries’ other than kmp and its subsidiaries and epb and its subsidiaries’ senior notes are secured equally and ratably with kmi’s 175 billion  senior secured revolving credit facility all of kmp and epb’s outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of its other senior debt obligations secured debt has also been incurred by some of kmp’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries all of the fixed rate senior notes of kmi kmp or epb provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and in most cases plus a makewhole premium 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the consolidated balances of longterm debt including the current portion and the preferred interest in the general partner of kmp but excluding debt fair value adjustments was 33062 million  and 30154 million  respectively to date our and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness 

during 2013 we paid down the ep acquisition debt using 947 million  of proceeds from the march 2013 dropdown transaction and 239 million  of proceeds from the sale of the remainder of the epc building note to third parties in the second quarter of 2013 we anticipate that we will continue to reduce our debt balance with proceeds from future dropdown transactions 

based on our historical record we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we and our subsidiaries including kmp and epb are subject however to conditions in the equity and debt markets and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the equity markets we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings furthermore our subsidiaries’ ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by their respective credit ratings see “—credit ratings and capital market liquidity” above for a discussion of our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings 

kmi and some of its direct and indirect subsidiaries referred to as the combined other guarantor subsidiaries guarantee the payment of certain of el paso’s formerly known as el paso corporation outstanding debt as of the successor date of august 13 2012 each series of el paso outstanding notes in aggregate principal amount became guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by kmi and the combined other guarantor subsidiaries as of december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 38 billion  and 39 billion  respectively in aggregate principal amount of these series of el paso senior notes is outstanding see note 19 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements

capital expenditures 

  

we account for our capital expenditures in accordance with gaap capital expenditures include those that are maintenancesustaining capital expenditures and those that are capital additions and improvements which we refer to as 

expansion or discretionary capital expenditures these distinctions are used when determining cash from operations pursuant to the mlp partnership agreements which is distinct from gaap cash flows from operating activities capital additions and improvements are those expenditures which increase throughput or capacity from that which existed immediately prior to the addition or improvement and are not deducted in calculating cash from operations maintenance capital expenditures are those which maintain throughput or capacity thus under the mlp partnership agreements the distinction between maintenance capital expenditures and capital additions and improvements is a physical determination rather than an economic one 

generally the determination of whether a capital expenditure is classified as maintenance or as capital additions and improvements is made on a project level the classification of the mlp’s capital expenditures as capital additions and improvements or as maintenance capital expenditures under the partnership agreements is left to the good faith determination of kmgp as kmp’s general partner and el paso pipeline gp company llc as epb’s general partner which is deemed conclusive 

  

generally we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations and we initially fund our discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program for kmp until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively replace the initial funding with longterm debt or equity or both 

  

 our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2013 and the amount we expect to spend for 2014 to sustain and grow our business are as follows in millions

cash flows 

  

the following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each period presented 



operating activities 

the net increase of 1269 45 million in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to 

 investing activities 

the 2020 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to 

 financing activities 

the net decrease of 3679 million in cash from financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to 

 91 

assets to kmp” and note 8 “debt—kmi” respectively to our consolidated financial statements and iii a 1695 million net decrease in our and our subsidiaries other debt repayments and debt issuances 

 kmi dividends   

our board of directors has adopted the dividend policy set forth in our shareholders’ agreement which provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our capital stock equal to the cash we receive from our subsidiaries and other sources less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes the division of our dividends among our various classes of capital stock that were outstanding prior to december 26 2012 discussed further following was in accordance with our charter our board of directors may declare dividends by a majority vote in accordance with our dividend policy pursuant to our bylaws this policy reflects our judgment that our stockholders would be better served if we distributed to them a substantial portion of our cash as a result we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities including acquisitions 



as shown in the table above we declared dividends of 160 per share for 2013 a 14 increase over our 2012 declared dividends of 140 per share 

on december 26 2012 the remaining outstanding shares of our class a class b and class c common stock were fully converted into class p shares and as of december 31 2012 only our class p common stock was outstanding prior to the above common stock conversions dividends on our class a class b and class c common stock investor retained stock generally were paid at the same time as dividends on our common stock and were based on the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock was convertible on the record date for the applicable dividend the portion of our dividends payable on the three classes of our investor retained stock varied among those classes but the variations did not affect the dividends we paid on our common stock since the total number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock could convert in the aggregate was fixed on the closing of our initial public offering 

our board of directors may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason there is nothing in our dividend policy or our governing documents that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities our capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors in particular distributions received from kmp continue to be the most significant source of our cash available to pay dividends our ability to pay and increase dividends to our stockholders is primarily dependent on distributions received from kmp and epb 

our dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future we pay our dividends after we receive quarterly distributions from kmp and epb which are paid within 45 days after the end of each quarter generally on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november therefore our dividend generally will be paid on or about the 16th day of each february may august and november if the day after we receive kmp’s and epb’s distributions is not a business day we expect to pay our dividend on the business day immediately following

 item  7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks by executing a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas ngl and crude oil the derivative contracts that we or kmp use include energy products traded on the nymex and otc markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

as part of the ep acquisition we acquired power forward and swap contracts we have entered into offsetting positions that eliminate the price risks associated with our power contracts as part of the may 1 2013 copano acquisition kmp acquired derivative contracts related to natural gas ngl and crude oil none of these derivatives are designated as accounting hedges 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous financial position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our physical position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas kmp often enters into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of its crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of its natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful to the extent gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s rating service 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas ngl and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us and our subsidiaries to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet dividenddistribution targets we may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 

  

in accounting for cash flow hedges gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income outside “net income” reported in our consolidated statements of income but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income that is for cash flow hedges all effective components of the derivative contracts’ gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income pending occurrence of the expected transaction other comprehensive income consists of those financial items that are within “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are within “noncontrolling interests” and are not included in our net income thus in highly effective cash flow hedges where there is no ineffectiveness other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion and those contracts not designated as hedges are included in current net income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss in addition when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “noncontrolling interests” and are transferred to the income statement as well effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales depreciation interest expense etc 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas crude oil and power derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values as of december 31 2013 and 2012 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity natural gas prices would affect the estimated fair value of natural gas derivatives held by us and kmp by 15 million  and 7 million  respectively as of both december 31 2013 and 2012 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity crude oil prices would affect the estimated fair value of crude oil derivatives held by kmp by 201 million  and 196 million  respectively as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity ngl prices would affect the estimated fair value of kmp’s ngl derivatives by 5 million  as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity electricity prices would not affect the estimated fair value of our power derivatives as of december 31 2012 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity electricity prices would affect the estimated fair value of our power derivatives by 2 million  as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the natural gas crude oil ngl and power portfolios of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 

  

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying values of the fixed rate debt including the debt fair value adjustments were 33129 million  and 29554 million  respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2013 and 2012 fair values of 33185 million  and 31882 million  respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2013 and 2012 would result in changes of approximately 1185 million  and 1048 million  respectively in the fair values of these instruments 

the carrying value of the variable rate debt which approximates the fair value excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following was 3064 million  and 4847 million  as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively as of december 31 2013 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 725 million  and 4675 million  respectively as of december 31 2012 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 725 million  and 5525 million  respectively an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal which is called the notional principal amount normally at each payment or settlement date the party who owes more pays the net amount so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 51 basis points  in 2013 and approximately 49 basis points  in 2012 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 and 2012 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 43 million  and 55 million  respectively in our 2013 and 2012 annual pretax earnings as of both december 31 2013 and 2012 epb had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 

interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

  

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time through our subsidiaries may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements in general kmp attempts to maintain an overall target mix of approximately 50 fixed rate debt and 50 of variable rate debt and typically kmi excluding kmp targets well below that level for variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 approximately 27  of kmi’s debt excluding that of kmp and epb is variable rate debt

in 2012 trans mountain delivered an average of 291000 barrels per day the crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through trans mountain’s pipeline system originates in alberta and british columbia the refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to kamloops british columbia and vancouver originates from oil refineries located in edmonton petroleum products delivered through trans mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in british columbia washington state and elsewhere offshore 

trans mountain also operates a 53 mile spur line from its sumas pump station to the us  canada international border where it connects with our approximate 63mile 16inch to 20inch diameter puget sound pipeline system the puget sound pipeline system in the state of washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 135000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents approximately 25 of throughput and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern washington state the volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in alaska and other offshore sources 

in february 2013 trans mountain completed negotiations with the canadian association of petroleum producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning january 1 2013 and ending december 31 2015 trans mountain anticipates neb approval in the second quarter of 2013 

express system 

kmp owns a onethird ownership interest in the express pipeline system kmp operates the express pipeline system and accounts for its onethird investment under the equity method of accounting the express pipeline system is a batchmode commoncarrier crude oil pipeline system comprised of the express pipeline and the platte pipeline collectively referred to in this report as the express pipeline system the approximate 1700mile integrated oil transportation pipeline connects canadian and us producers to refineries located in the us rocky mountain and midwest regions 

the express pipeline is a 780mile 24inch diameter pipeline that begins at the crude oil pipeline terminal at hardisty alberta and terminates at the casper wyoming facilities of the platte pipeline the express pipeline has a design capacity of 280000 barrels per day receipts at hardisty averaged 191700 barrels per day in 2012 

the platte pipeline is a 926mile 20inch diameter pipeline that runs from the crude oil pipeline terminal at casper wyoming to refineries and interconnecting pipelines in the wood river illinois area the platte pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 150000 barrels per day downstream of casper wyoming and approximately 140000 barrels per day downstream of guernsey wyoming platte deliveries averaged 148000 barrels per day in 2012 

on december 11 2012 kmp announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interests in the express pipeline system to spectra this sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013 

jet fuel pipeline system 

kmp also owns and operates the approximate 25mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline

system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15000 barrels 

competition 

trans mountain and the express pipeline system are each one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and each competes against other pipeline providers 

other 

during 2012 our other segment activities include those operations that were acquired from ep on may 25 2012 and are primarily related to several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with ep’s legacy trading activities these contracts obligate ep to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028 in 2010 this segment primarily consisted of our power facility which was sold on october 22 2010 this segment also included an interest in the bolivia to brazil pipeline which we sold for 88 million on january 18 2013 

major customers 

our total operating revenues are derived from a wide customer base    for each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues kmp’s texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2 kmp business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines and co 2 kmp business segments in 2012 2011 and 2010 accounted for 26 42 and 46 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

regulation 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

on october 24 1992 congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on kmp’s pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified

circumstances to change rates 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation  canadian operations 

the canadian portion of kmp’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of canada’s national energy board referred to in this report as the neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service 

trans mountain pipeline   trans mountain previously had a oneyear toll settlement with shippers that expired on december 31 2012 in february 2013 trans mountain completed negotiations with the canadian association of petroleum producers for a new negotiated toll settlement to be effective for 2013 trans mountain anticipates approval from the neb in the s econd quarter of 2013 the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the us falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc see “interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” 

express pipeline   the canadian segment of the express pipeline is regulated by the neb as a group 2 pipeline which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only express committed contract rates are subject to a 2 inflation adjustment april 1 of each year the us segment of the express pipeline and the platte pipeline are regulated by the ferc see “interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation  us operations” additionally movements on the platte pipeline within the state of wyoming are regulated by the wyoming public service commission which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that operate in the state of wyoming the wyoming public service commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the ferc and the neb 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we could charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 beginning in the mid1980’s through the mid1990’s the ferc initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace among the most important of these changes were 

 the ferc standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues including i the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees ii the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees iii the definition of transmission function information iv independent functioning v transparency and vi the interaction of ferc standards with the north american energy standards board business practice standards the ferc also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities in light of the changing structure of the energy industry these standards of conduct govern employee relationshipsusing a functional approachto ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis pursuant to the ferc’s standards of conduct a

items 1 and 2 business and properties  continued 

natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee nonpublic information about the transmission system or a transmission customer additionally noconduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing nonpublic information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit 

rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees marketing function employees officers directors supervisory employees and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

california public utilities commission rate regulation 

the intrastate common carrier operations of kmp’s pacific operations’ pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission referred to in this report as the cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by kmp with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to kmp’s ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates certain of the pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been and continue to be subject to complaints with the cpuc as is more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

texas railroad commission rate regulation 

the intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the texas railroad commission the texas railroad commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

mexico  energy regulating commission 

the miermonterrey pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the energy regulating commission the commission on september 30 2002 and it defines the general and directional conditions for the company to carry out the activity and provide the natural gas transportation service this permit has a term of 30 years 

this permit establishes certain restrictive conditions including without limitations i compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service ii compliance with certain safety measures contingency plans maintenance plans and the official mexican standards regarding safety iii compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the project presented to the commission iv compliance with certain technical studies established by the commission and v compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10 of the investment proposed in the project 

safety regulation 

we are also subject to safety regulations imposed by the us department of transportation pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration referred to as phmsa including those requiring us to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas or hcas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm 

the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in hcas can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

items 1 and 2 business and properties  continued 

continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the us department of transportation rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

the president signed into law new pipeline safety legislation in january 2012 the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 which increased penalties for violations of safety laws and rules among other matters and may result in the imposition of more stringent regulations in the next few years phmsa is also currently considering changes to its regulations phmsa recently issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate regulations changes to regulations or an increase in public expectations for pipeline safety may require additional reporting the replacement of some of our pipeline segments the addition of monitoring equipment and more frequent inspection or testing of our pipeline facilities any repair remediation preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures 

from time to time our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures these leaks and ruptures may cause explosions fire damage to the environment damage to property andor personal injury or death in connection with these incidents we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines andor to properly maintain our pipelines depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health administration osha and other comparable federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety in general we believe current expenditures are addressing the osha requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees based on new regulatory developments we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards however such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be estimated at this time 

state and local regulation 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

environmental matters 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the us and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

items 1 and 2 business and properties  continued 

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the us environmental protection agency referred to in this report as the us epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures 

we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 397 million  as of december 31 2012 our reserve estimates range in value from approximately 397 million to approximately 529 million  and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the us epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

superfund 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the us epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although petroleum is excluded from cercla’s definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

clean air act 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations we believe that the operations of our pipelines storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes the us epa adopted new regulations under the clean air act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources see “climate change” below 

clean water act 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the us the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release

climate change 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases including the epa programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 

the epa published in december 2009 its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment pursuant to this endangerment finding and other rulemakings and interpretations epa concluded that stationary sources would become subject to federal permitting requirements under the clean air act in starting in 2011 in 2010 the epa issued a final rule known as the “tailoring rule” that defined regulatory emissions thresholds at which certain new and modified stationary sources would become subject to permitting and other requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act some of our facilities emit greenhouse gases in excess of the tailoring rule’s thresholds and have been required to obtain and must continue to comply with a title v permit for greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 the epa implemented permitting for new andor modified sources of greenhouse gas emissions through the existing psd permitting program the epa has indicated in rulemakings that it may reduce the current tailoring rule regulatory thresholds for greenhouse gases making additional sources subject to psd permitting requirements but has declined to do so at this time permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions may also trigger permitting requirements for emissions of other regulated air pollutants as well additional direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in our industry may be implemented under other clean air act programs including the new source performance standards or nsps program the epa has already proposed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain electric generating units under the nsps program a final regulation is expected in 2013 while these proposed nsps regulations for electric generating units would not directly apply to our operations the epa may propose a greenhouse gas nsps for additional source categories 

in addition in 2009 the epa published a final rule requiring that specified large greenhouse gas emissions sources annually report the greenhouse gas emissions for the preceding year in the us beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 in 2010 the epa published a final rule expanding its existing greenhouse gas emissions reporting rule for petroleum and natural gas facilities including natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year the rule which went into effect in december 2010 requires reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by september 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter some of our facilities are required to report under this rule and operational andor regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements 

at the state level more than onethird of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs although many of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that sources such as our gasfired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations depending on the particular program we could be required to purchase and surrender emission allowances 

because our and our subsidiaries operations including the compressor stations and processing plants emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and carbon dioxide such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities depending on the particular law regulation or program we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new emission controls on the facilities acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries pipelines such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or prospects 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

items 1 and 2 business and properties  continued 

river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels capandtrade legislation or us epa regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the co 2 kmp business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although the magnitude and direction of these impacts cannot now be predicted greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

epa regulation of internal combustion engines 

internal combustion engines used in our operations are also subject to epa regulation under the clean air act the epa published new regulations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocating internal combustion engines on august 20 2010 on june 7 2012 the epa proposed amendments to these regulations which are expected to be finalized in the near future the epa also revised the new source performance standards for stationary compression ignition and spark ignition internal combustion engines on june 28 2011 and has proposed minor amendments included in the june 7 2012 proposed rule compliance with these new regulations may require significant capital expenditures for physical modifications and may require operational changes as well we are not able to estimate such increased costs however as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant for us 

recent epa rules regarding oil and natural gas air emissions 

in addition on april 17 2012 the epa approved final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production pipelines and processing operations these rules were published in the federal register on august 16 2012 and became effective on october 15 2012 for new or reworked hydraulically fractured gas wells the rules require the control of emissions through flaring or reduced emission or “green” completions until 2015 when the rules require the use of green completions the rules also establish specific new requirements effective in 2012 for emissions from compressors dehydrators storage tanks gas processing plants and certain other equipment these rules may therefore require a number of modifications to our and our customers’ operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions in october 2012 several challenges to epa’s rules were filed by various parties including environmental groups and industry associations depending on the outcome of such proceedings the rules may be modified or rescinded or epa may issue new rules the costs of compliance with any modified or newly issued rules cannot be predicted 

additionally on december 11 2012 seven states submitted a notice of intent to sue the epa to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources are appropriate and if so to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector which was not addressed in the epa rule that became effective on october 15 2012 the notice of intent also requested epa issue emission guidelines for the control of methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources depending on whether rules are promulgated and the applicability and restrictions in any promulgated rule compliance with such rules could result in additional costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs while we are not able at this time to estimate such additional costs as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant for us compliance with such rules may also make it more difficult for us and our customers to operate thereby reducing the volume of natural gas transported through our pipelines which may adversely affect our business 

department of homeland security 

in section 550 of the homeland security appropriations act of 2007 the us congress gave the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities pursuant to its congressional mandate on april 9 2007 the dhs promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined risk based performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to

new regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes in regulations by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our income and operations 

our pipelines and storage facilities are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and 

gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service ii the types of services we may offer to our customers iii the contracts for service entered into with our customers iv the certification and construction of new facilities v the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vi the acquisition of other businesses vii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities viii reporting and information posting requirements ix the maintenance of accounts and records and x relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines furthermore new laws or regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources for example the department of homeland security appropriation act of 2007 required the issuance of regulations establishing riskbased performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk” new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessregulation” 

the ferc the cpuc or the neb may establish pipeline tariff rates that have a negative impact on us in addition the ferc the cpuc the neb or our customers could file complaints challenging the tariff rates charged by our pipelines and a successful complaint could have an adverse impact on us 

the profitability of our regulated pipelines is influenced by fluctuations in costs and our ability to recover any increases in our costs in the rates charged to our shippers to the extent that our costs increase in an amount greater than what we are permitted by the ferc the cpuc or the neb to recover in our rates or to the extent that there is a lag before we can file and obtain rate increases such events can have a negative impact upon our operating results can be negatively impacted 

our existing rates may also be challenged by complaint regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the regulators that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates further the ferc may initiate investigations to determine whether some interstate natural gas pipelines have overcollected on rates charged to shippers we may face challenges similar to those described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report to the rates we charge on kmp’s epb’s and our other pipelines any successful challenge could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

energy commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to natural gas transmission and storage activities and refined petroleum products and carbon dioxide transportation activitiessuch as leaks explosions and mechanical problemsthat could result in substantial financial losses in addition these risks may result in serious injury and loss of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks may be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and earnings while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines may require us to incur significant capital and operating expense outlays to comply 

primarily through our regulated pipeline subsidiaries we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity there are for example federal guidelines for the us dot and pipeline companies in the areas of testing education training and communication the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of the compliance costs are pipeline integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary changes such as advances of inline inspection tools identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in high consequence areas can have a significant impact on integrity testing and repair costs we plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the us dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated 

capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities   

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up or otherwise respond to the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we have utilized operating handling and disposal practices that were consistent with industry practices at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances was not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the us such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

in addition our oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities in restricted areas emissions into the environment water discharges transportation of hazardous materials and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

financial position results of operations and prospects for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change” 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs for us 

methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases the us epa began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the us beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources fractionated natural gas liquids and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide like our mcelmo dome carbon dioxide field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere 

because our operations including our compressor stations and natural gas processing plants in our natural gas pipelines segment emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and carbon dioxide such regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however they could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and propertiesc narrative description of businessenvironmental mattersclimate change 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells which could adversely impact kmp’s and epb’s revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on their natural gas pipelines 

the natural gas industry is increasingly relying on natural gas supplies from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane the extraction of natural gas from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells recently there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of natural gas and in turn adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on our or our joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines several of which gather gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent 

we may face competition from other pipelines and other forms of transportation into the areas we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers natural gas crude oil or petroleum products into the areas that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to destinations not served by us 

cost overruns and delays on our expansion and new build projects could adversely affect our business    

kmp epb and our other pipelines regularly expand their assets and construct new build projects they also conduct what are referred to as “open seasons” to evaluate the potential customer interest for new construction projects a variety of factors outside of their control such as weather natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals as well as performance by thirdparty contractors has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows 

we must either obtain the right from landowners or exercise the power of eminent domain in order to use most of the land on which our pipelines are constructed and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use 

we obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land for a period of time if we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines our business could be negatively affected in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners primarily through rental increases and renewals of expired agreements 

whether kmp epb or our other pipelines have the power of eminent domain for their pipelines other than interstate natural gas pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipelinepetroleum liquids natural gas or carbon dioxideand the laws of the particular state our interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority in either case we must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court our inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect our subsidiaries’ business if they were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which pipelines are located 

kmp’s and epb’s acquisition strategies and expansion programs require access to new capital limitations on their access to capital would impair our ability to grow    

consistent with the terms of kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements kmp and epb distribute most of the cash generated by their operations as a result they have relied on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund acquisition and growth capital expenditures however to the extent our limited partnerships are unable to continue to finance growth externally their cash distribution policy will significantly impair their ability to grow kmp andor epb may need new capital to finance these activities limitations on access to capital whether due to tightened capital markets more expensive capital or otherwise will impair their ability to execute this strategy 

kmp’s and epb’s growth strategies may cause difficulties integrating and constructing new operations and they may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from any future acquisitions    

part of kmp’s and epb’s business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses expanding existing assets and constructing new facilities if they do not successfully integrate acquisitions expansions or newly constructed facilities anticipated operating advantages and cost savings may not occur the integration of companies that have previously operated separately involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in its size after an acquisition expansion or completed construction project ii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting estimating reporting and other systems iv difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees and v potential adverse effects on operating results 

our limited partnerships may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition expansion or construction project will depend upon their ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations cost savings and other sizerelated benefits they expected may not be achieved which could harm their financial condition and results of operations 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 32 billion of consolidated debt including kmp and epb but excluding debt fair value adjustments this level of debt could have important consequences such as i limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt iii placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and iv increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to service our debt will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness or any future indebtedness that we incur we will be forced to take actions which may include reducing dividends reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about our debt see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

our large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 11 billion 35 of our approximately 32 billion consolidated debt including kmp and epb but excluding debt fair value adjustment was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm debt of variable rate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt effectively converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and our earnings could be adversely affected for more information about our interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk” 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs    

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

there is the potential for a change of control of the general partners of kmp and epb if we default on debt  

we own all of the common equity of the general partners of kmp and epb if we default on debt then the lenders under such debt in exercising their rights as lenders could acquire control of the general partners of kmp and epb through their control of us a change of control of the general partners of kmp and epb could materially adversely affect the distributions we receive from kmp and epb which could have a material adverse impact on us or our cash available for dividends to our stockholders 

our business financial condition and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit 

adverse changes to the availability terms and cost of capital interest rates or our credit ratings could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities and reducing our cash flows our credit ratings may be impacted by our leverage liquidity credit profile and potential transactions also continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations on favorable terms a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any reduction in our credit ratings could negatively impact the credit ratings of our subsidiaries which could increase their cost of capital and negatively affect their business and operating results although the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our and our subsidiaries debt instruments as well as the market value of kmps and epbs common units 

distressed financial conditions of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide     

some of our customers may experience severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities in addition such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

terrorist attacks or “cyber security” events or the threat of them may adversely affect our business  

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other assets and systems might be specific targets of terrorist organizations or “cyber security” events these potential targets might include our pipeline systems or 

operating systems and may affect our ability to operate or control our pipeline assets our operations could be disrupted andor customer information could be stolen the occurrence of one of these events could cause a substantial decrease in revenues increased costs to respond or other financial loss damage to reputation increased regulation or litigation and or inaccurate information reported from our operations 

there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our pipeline business is dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities transported by our pipelines 

our pipelines depend on production of natural gas oil and other products in the areas served by our pipelines without reserve additions production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our gas plants and pipelines may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at levels that encourage producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire 

changes in the business environment such as a decline in crude oil or natural gas prices an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices supply disruptions or higher development costs could result in a slowing of supply from oil and natural gas producing areas in addition with respect to the co 2 kmp business segment changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil and natural gas each of these factors impact our customers shipping through our pipelines which in turn could impact the prospects of new transportation contracts or renewals of existing contracts 

throughput on kmp’s andor epb’s pipelines also may decline as a result of changes in business conditions over the long term business will depend in part on the level of demand for oil natural gas and refined petroleum products in the geographic areas in which deliveries are made by pipelines and the ability and willingness of shippers having access or rights to utilize the pipelines to supply such demand 

the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products increase our costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products 

the future success of kmp’s oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon its ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves and revenues of the oil and gas producing assets within the co 2 kmp business segment will decline kmp may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if kmp does not realize production volumes greater than or equal to its hedged volumes it may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

kmp’s development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

the volatility of natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on the co 2 kmp segment 

the revenues profitability and future growth of the co 2 kmp business segment and the carrying value of its oil natural gas liquids and natural gas properties depend to a large degree on prevailing oil and gas prices for 2013 kmp estimates that every 1 change in the average west texas intermediate crude oil price per barrel would impact the co 2 kmp segment’s cash flows by approximately 6 million prices for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond kmp’s control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the us ii the condition of the us economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political stability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources 

a sharp decline in the prices of oil natural gas liquids or natural gas would result in a commensurate reduction in kmp’s revenues income and cash flows from the production of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of kmp’s proved reserves in the event prices fall substantially kmp may not be able to realize a profit from its production and would operate at a loss in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process 

our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not always possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely mitigate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 

the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

the doddfrank act requires the commodities futures trading commission referred to as the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market while the cftc’s rule promulgated pursuant to the doddfrank act has been vacated by a us district court and is on appeal the cftc has taken the position that the act also requires the cftc to institute broad new aggregate position limits for overthecounter swaps and futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the doddfrank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us the doddfrank act and any new regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the kinder morgan canadakmp segment is subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of the kinder morgan canadakmp business segment a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between us and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the us and canada volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of the co 2 kmp business segment if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the us or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

kmps and epbs tax treatment depends on their status as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes as well as not being subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation by individual states if kmp andor epb were treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes or if they were to become subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation for state tax purposes then cash available for distribution to their partners including us would be substantially reduced   

we own the general partner interests in both kmp and epb and approximately 11 and 41 of the limited partner interests of kmp and of epb respectively the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of our investment in kmp and epb depends largely on their treatment as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes neither kmp nor epb has requested nor plans to request a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter 

despite the fact that kmp and epb are organized as limited partnerships under delaware law it is possible in certain circumstances for partnerships such as kmp or epb to be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes although neither kmp nor epb believes based on its current operations that it is or will be so treated the irs could disagree with the positions kmp or epb takes or a change in kmps or epbs business or a change in current law could cause them to be treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject them to taxation as an entity 

if they were treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes they would pay us federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate which is currently a maximum of 35 and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates distributions by kmp and epb to their partners including us would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends to the extent of their current and accumulated earnings and profits and no income gains losses deductions or credits would flow through to their partners including us because tax would be imposed on kmp and epb as corporations their aftertax cash 

available for distribution would be substantially reduced likely causing a substantial reduction in the dividends we could pay and in the value of our common stock 

the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships including kmp and epb or an investment in them may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time moreover from time to time members of the us congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that could affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 

in addition because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entitylevel taxation through the imposition of state income franchise or other forms of taxation any state income taxes imposed upon kmp or epb as entities would reduce their cash available to be distributed to us any modification to the us federal income or state tax laws or interpretations thereof may be applied retroactively and could negatively impact the value of our investment in kmp and epb 

kmps and epbs partnership agreements provide that if a law is enacted that subjects them to corporate taxation or otherwise subjects them to entitylevel taxation for us federal income tax purposes the minimum quarterly distribution amounts and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact 

if kmp’s or epb’s unitholders remove their respective general partner we would lose our general partner interest in either kmp or epb including the right to incentive distributions and the ability to manage them 

we own the general partners of kmp and epb and with respect to kmp all of the voting shares of kmr to which the general partner has delegated its rights and powers to control the business and affairs of kmp subject to the approval of the general partner for certain actions kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements however give their respective unitholders the right to remove their general partner if i the holders of 66 2⁄3 of the respective partnership’s outstanding units including the common units class b units and iunits as applicable voting as a single class vote for such removal ii the holders of kmp’s and epb’s outstanding units approve the election and succession of a new general partner by the same vote respectively and iii kmp and or epb receives opinion of counsel that the removal and succession of the general partner would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any limited partner or its operating partnership subsidiaries or cause either kmp or epb or its operating partnership subsidiaries to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

if kmp’s or epb’s unitholders removed their respective general partner the general partner would lose its ability to manage kmp or epb and with respect to kmp the delegation of authority to kmr by kmp’s general partner would terminate at the same time the general partner would receive cash or common units in exchange for its general partner interest while the cash or common units the general partner would receive are intended under the terms of kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements to fully compensate us as the owner of the general partner in the event such an exchange is required the value of the investments we might make with the cash or the common units may not over time be equivalent to the value of the general partner interest and the related incentive distributions had the general partner retained its general partner interest 

if in the future kmr and the general partner cease to manage and control kmp with respect to kmp and epb’s general partner ceases to manage and control epb either limited partnership may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 

if our subsidiaries kmr and kinder morgan gp inc which is the general partner of kmp cease to manage and control kmp or el paso pipeline gp llc ceases to manage and control epb either or both kmp and epb may be deemed to be investment companies under the investment company act of 1940 in that case kmp andor epb would either have to register as an investment company under the investment company act obtain exemptive relief from the sec or modify their organizational structure or contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company registering as an investment company could among other things materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our growth may be hindered 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly our chairman and chief executive officer richard d kinder who is also one of our founders along with the other members of our senior 

management mr kinder has been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy since 1997 if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

the price of the common stock may be volatile and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investments 

the market price of the common stock could be volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the common stock due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for the common stock include i changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding the common stock the common units of kmp and epb other companies comparable to us or kmp and epb or companies in the industries we serve ii actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects iii reaction to our public announcements iv strategic actions taken by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings v the recruitment or departure of key personnel vi new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations vii changes in tax or accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles viii adverse conditions in the financial markets or general us or international economic conditions including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism and responses to such events ix sales of common stock by us members of our management team or significant stockholders and x the extent of analysts’ interest in following our company 

nonus holders of our common stock may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on the disposition of our common stock 

if we are or have been a ‘’us real property holding corporation’’ within the meaning of the code at any time within the shorter of i the fiveyear period preceding a disposition of our common stock by a nonus holder or ii such holder’s holding period for such common stock and assuming our common stock is ‘’regularly traded’’ as defined by applicable us treasury regulations on an established securities market the nonus holder may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on such disposition if it held more than 5 of our common stock during the shorter of periods i and ii above we believe we are or may become a us real property holding corporation 

risks related to our dividend policy 

holders of our common stock may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under our dividend policy or any dividends at all 

our dividend policy provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends generally representing the cash we receive from our subsidiaries less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes however our board of directors subject to the requirements of our bylaws and other governance documents may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and even while the current policy is in place the actual amount of dividends on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities capital requirements of our subsidiaries legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors dividends other than as provided in our dividend policy require supermajority board approval while the sponsor investors maintain prescribed ownership thresholds 

over time our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs which could affect whether we pay dividends and the amount of any dividends we may pay in the future the terms of any future indebtedness we incur also may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our stock under certain circumstances a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result if our board of directors establishes large reserves that reduce the amount of quarterly dividends paid or if we reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

the general partners of kmp and epb with our consent but without the consent of our stockholders may take steps to support kmp and epb that have the effect of reducing cash we have or are entitled to receive thereby reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends 

we utilize kmp and epb as our vehicles for growth we have historically received a significant portion of our cash flows from incentive distributions on the general partner interest as the owner of the general partner of kmp and now epb we may take steps we judge beneficial to kmp’s and epb’s growth that in the shortrun reduce the cash we receive and have available to pay dividends the board of directors of the general partner of kmp or epb may determine to support a desirable acquisition that may not be immediately accretive to cash available for distribution per the respective partnership unit for example kmp’s general partner with our consent waived its incentive distributions from the second quarter of 2010 through 2011 on common units issued to finance a portion of kmp’s acquisition of the initial 50 interest in the kinderhawk joint venture and has agreed to waive its paid incentive distributions of 27 million and 4 million for 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 respectively on common units issued to finance a portion of kmp’s subsequent acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in the kinderhawk joint venture in addition in connection with kmp’s proposed acquisition of copano kmp’s general partner has agreed to waive incentive distributions in 2013 in an amount dependent on the time of closing 120 million in both 2014 and 2015 110 million in 2016 and annual amounts thereafter decreasing by 5 million per year from this level 

our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities above the limited partnership level or impair our financial flexibility 

if we pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities above the limited partnership level meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements or fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn in addition because of the dividends required under our dividend policy our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business above the limited partnership level including through acquisitions increased capital spending or other increases of our expenditures will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing we cannot assure our stockholders that such financing will be available to us at all or at an acceptable cost if we are unable to take timely advantage of growth opportunities our future financial condition and competitive position may be harmed which in turn may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to pay dividends 

all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries and our cash flow and our ability to satisfy obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries in addition our joint ventures and some of our subsidiaries such as our limited partnerships are not wholly owned by us when funds are distributed to us by such joint ventures and subsidiaries funds also will be distributed to their other owners 

each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and has no obligation to transfer funds to us a number of our subsidiaries are a party to credit facilities and are or may in the future be a party to other borrowing agreements that restrict the payment of dividends to us and such subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions will depend on their respective operating results and may be subject to further restrictions under among other things the laws of their jurisdiction of organization 

the board of directors of kmr which is the delegate of kmp’s general partner and epb’s general partner have broad authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of their businesses the establishment of those reserves could result in smaller distributions to us and a corresponding reduction of our cash available for dividends and our anticipated dividend level further the calculation of kmp’s and epb’s available cash for distribution is discretionary and subject to the approval of the board of directors of kmr or epb’s general partner respectively taking into consideration their constituent agreements similarly while the constituent agreements of ngpl provide that it is the intention of ngpl to make distributions of available cash we own less than a majority of ngpl and do not control it the same is true for joint ventures in which our limited partnerships own an interest 

the distributions we receive from kmp are largely attributable to the incentive distributions on our general partner interest the distributions we receive are not as large if kmp distributes cash from interim capital transactions rather than cash from operations or if kmp’s general partner waives receipt of a portion of those incentive distributions 

as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to receive cash through distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries in sufficient amounts to pay dividends on our common stock if we are unable to authorize the payment of dividends due to insufficient cash a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

our ability to pay dividends is restricted by delaware law 

under the dgcl our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of surplus as calculated in accordance with the dgcl or if we do not have a surplus it is paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year our bylaws require the declaration and payment of dividends to comply with the dgcl if as a result of these restrictions we are unable to authorize payment of dividends a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders 

risks related to conflicts of interest 

kmp epb and their subsidiaries may compete with us 

neither of kmp epb or any of their subsidiaries or entities in which they own an interest is restricted from competing with us kmr manages kmp subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of kmp’s general partner and epb’s general partner manages epb in what they consider to be the best interests of their respective limited partner interests kmp epb and their subsidiaries may acquire invest in or construct assets that may be in direct competition with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects among other things we and our limited partnerships have a policy that acquisition opportunities of businesses or operating assets will be pursued above the limited partnership level only if kmp and epb elect not to pursue the opportunity 

many of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries including kmr and epb or entities in which we own an interest such as ngpl as a result of which conflicts of interest exist and will arise in the future 

many of our directors and officers are also directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries any officer or director of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries who is also a director or officer of ours in making decisions in such person’s capacity as our officer or director is required to act in accordance with his or her fiduciary duties to us however in making decisions in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of one of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries or such other entities such person may make a decision that favors the interests of such subsidiary over our interests or the interests of our stockholders and may be to our detriment further the organizational documents of these entities may have provisions reducing or eliminating the duties of their officers or directors to those entities and their owners including us in addition our directors are not required to work full time on our business and affairs and may devote significant time to the affairs of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries there could be material competition for the time and effort of our directors who provide services to our nonwholly owned subsidiaries

general 

  

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets is built to support two principal components 

 

   

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines natural gas storage processing and treating facilities and bulk and liquids terminal facilities we also produce and sell crude oil our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states’ and canada’s various energy businesses and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

  

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly in kmp’s texas intrastate natural gas group it currently derives approximately 75 of its sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts that include requirements with minimum volume payment obligations as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2012 the remaining average contract life of our combined natural gas transportation contracts including intrastate pipelines’ purchase and sales contracts was approximately seven years 

  

the co 2  sales and transportation business primarily has thirdparty contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2012 had a remaining average contract life of approximately 10 years carbon dioxide sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for thirdparty contracts making deliveries in 2013 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2013 budget approximately 72 of our contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee or floor price and 28 fluctuate with the price of oil in the longterm our success in this portion of the co 2 kmp business segment is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide however shortterm changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2 kmp business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging

program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was   8772 per barrel in 2012 6973 per barrel in 2011 and 5996 per barrel in 2010 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged   8991 per barrel in 2012 9261 per barrel in 2011 and 7693 per barrel in 2010 

  

the factors impacting the terminalskmp business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums because these contracts are volume based above the minimums our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which on average is approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 

continuing our history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses in 2012 we completed the acquisition of ep implemented yearone post acquisition cost savings of more than 400 million sold ep’s exploration and production assets immediately prior to the acquisition close date dropped down the ep acquired assets of tgp and our 50 interest in epng to kmp using proceeds from this dropdown to delever kmi’s outstanding ep acquisition debt sold the ftc mandated kmp natural gas pipelines disposal group and ep completed its drop down of the cheyenne plains gas pipeline company llc to epb on may 24 2012 exclusive of the drops downs during 2012 kmp and epb from may 25 2012 through december 31 2012 have made business acquisitions and expansions of existing assets of 21 billion and 41 million respectively 

thus the amount that we are able to increase dividends to our shareholders will to some extent be a function of our and our subsidiaries’ ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions including those completed by kmp and epb we believe we will continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets and we have budgeted approximately 31 billion for our combined 2013 capital expansion program including small acquisitions and investment contributions but excluding the proposed copano acquisition discussed under items 1 and 2 “business and properties  recent developments  natural gas pipelines  kmp” we and our subsidiaries kmp and epb regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions including those from us or our affiliates and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions including

transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to kmp in 2013 given the partial year and about 010 per unit accretive for at least the next five years beginning in 2014 

while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost and includes factors over which we have limited or no control thus we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 

our or our subsidiaries’ including epb and kmp ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand our assets is impacted by our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions as master limited partnerships kmp and epb distribute all of their available cash and they access capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions historically kmp and epb have succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund their acquisitions and expansions and although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit we believe that kmp’s and epb’s stable cash flows credit ratings and historical records of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment distribution and acquisition strategies as well as refinance maturing debt when required for a further discussion of our liquidity including kmp’s and epb’s public debt and equity offerings in 2012 please see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

in addition a portion of kmp’s business portfolio including the kinder morgan canadakmp business segment the canadian portion of kmp’s cochin pipeline and the bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currencybased transactions both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in us  canadian dollar exchange rates to help understand our reported operating results all of the following references to “foreign currency effects” or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results in us dollars resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar the references are made to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 

kmi dividends   

our board of directors has adopted the dividend policy set forth in our shareholders’ agreement which provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our capital stock equal to the cash we receive from our subsidiaries and other sources less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes the division of our dividends among our classes of capital stock is in accordance with our charter our board of directors may declare dividends by a majority vote in accordance with our dividend policy pursuant to our bylaws this policy reflects our judgment that our stockholders would be better served if we distributed to them a substantial portion of our cash as a result we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities including acquisitions 



as shown in the table above we declared dividends of 140 per share for 2012 a 17 increase over our 2011 declared dividends of 120 per share the 2011 per share amounts are presented as if we were publicly traded for all of 2011 we expect to declare dividends of 157 per share for 2013 a 12 increase over our 2012 declared dividends growth in 2013 is expected to be driven by continued strong performance at kmp along with contributions from epb and the natural gas assets that kmi acquired in the ep transaction as presented in the following tables during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 we generated cash available to pay dividends of 1411 million cash available per share of 155 and 866 million cash available per share of 122 respectively

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

on december 26 2012 the remaining outstanding shares of our class a class b and class c common stock were converted into class p shares and as of december 31 2012 only our class p common stock was outstanding prior to the above common stock conversions dividends on our class a class b and class c common stock investor retain stock generally were paid at the same time as dividends on our common stock and were based on the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock was convertible on the record date for the applicable dividend the portion of our dividends payable on the three classes of our investor retained stock varied among those classes but the variations did not affect the dividends we paid on our common stock since the total number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock could convert in the aggregate was fixed on the closing of our initial public offering 

our board of directors may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason there is nothing in our dividend policy or our governing documents that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities our capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors in particular distributions received from kmp continue to be the most significant source of our cash available to pay dividends our ability to pay and increase dividends to our stockholders is primarily dependent on distributions received from kmp and epb 

our dividends are not cumulative consequently if dividends on our common stock are not paid at the intended levels our common stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future we pay our dividends after we receive quarterly distributions from kmp and epb which are paid within 45 days after the end of each quarter generally on or about the 15th day of each february may august and november therefore our dividend generally will be paid on or about the 16th day of each february may august and november if the day after we receive kmp’s and epb’s distributions is not a business day we expect to pay our dividend on the business day immediately following

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of us generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

  

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows

for acquired businesses we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values with limited exceptions on the date of acquisition determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates market prices and asset lives among other items the judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition such as through depreciation and amortization expense for more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

environmental matters 

  

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable we record at fair value where appropriate environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination 

  

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 

  

these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management’s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

legal matters 

  

 many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time is reasonably possible to occur and may require substantial expenditures we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 

  

as of december 31 2012 kmp’s most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved its west coast products pipelines transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines’ interstate and intrastate california rates respectively for more information on regulatory proceedings see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year there were no impairment charges resulting from our may 31 2012 impairment testing and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date for more information on our goodwill see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for more information on our amortizable intangibles see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

  

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves please see “supplemental information on oil and gas activities unaudited” included elsewhere in this report 

  

hedging activities 

  

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of us generally accepted accounting principles to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

  

since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity pricesa perfectly effective hedgewe often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for example when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations accordingly our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges for more information on our hedging activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

employee benefit plans 

  

we reflect an asset or liability for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on their overfunded or underfunded status as of december 31 2012 our pension plans were underfunded by 552 million and our other postretirement benefits plans were underfunded by 426 million our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit costs are primarily based on actuarial calculations we use various assumptions in performing these calculations including those related to the return that we expect to earn on our plan assets the rate at which we expect the compensation of our employees to increase over the plan term the estimated cost of health care when benefits are provided under our plan and other factors a significant assumption we utilize is the discount rate used in calculating our benefit obligations we select our discount rates by matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to the average yields of various highquality bonds with corresponding maturities the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

actual results may differ from the assumptions included in these calculations and as a result our estimates associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits can be and often are revised in the future the income statement impact of the changes in the assumptions on our related benefit obligations are deferred and amortized into income over either the period of expected future service of active participants or over the expected future lives of inactive plan participants we record these deferred amounts as either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations as of december 31 2012 we had deferred net losses of approximately 290 million in pretax accumulated other comprehensive income related to our pension and other postretirement benefits

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

the following table shows the impact of a 1 change in the primary assumptions used in our actuarial calculations associated with our pension and other postretirement benefits for the year ended december 31 2012 



income taxes 

  

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

  

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments including our investment in kmp the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investment in kmp 

  

going private transaction 

  

a going private transaction completed in may 2007 was accounted for as a purchase business combination accordingly our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the going private transaction with the excess of the purchase price over these combined fair values recorded as goodwill

year ended december 31 2012 vs 2011 

  

our total revenues for 2012 and 2011 were 100 billion and 79 billion respectively net income attributable to kinder morgan inc’s stockholders totaled 315 million for 2012 as compared to net income of 594 million in 2011 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

for 2012 our net income attributable to kinder morgan inc was impacted by i 310 million in aftertax expenses associated with the ep acquisition and ep energy sale ii deferred tax adjustments primarily associated with the ep acquisition which resulted in an incremental benefit of 57 million iii 128 million aftertax noncash impairment charge associated with our ngpl investment and iv 213 million in aftertax kmp’s ftc natural gas pipelines disposal group remeasurement loss and costs to sell 

total segment earnings before all noncash depreciation depletion and amortization expenses including amortization of excess cost of equity investments ebda increased 2063 million 68 in 2012 compared to 2011 however this overall increase in earnings i included a 89 million increase in ebda from the effect of the certain items described in the footnote b to the table above which combined to decrease total segment ebda by 285 million and 374 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and ii excluded 71 million decrease in ebda from discontinued operations as described in footnote e to the table above and excluding both the combined 937 million loss from the remeasurement of net assets to fair value and disposal costs from the sale of net assets in 2012 and the 10 million increase in expense in 2011 from the writeoff of a receivable for fuel undercollected prior to 2011 after adjusting for these two items the remaining 1903 million 52 increase in total segment ebda in 2012 compared to 2011 resulted from higher earnings from all reportable business segments driven mainly by increases attributable to the natural gas pipelines primarily due to the contributions from the ep operations including epb the co 2 —kmp and the terminals—kmp business segments 

  

year ended december 31 2011 vs 2010 

  

our total revenues for both 2011 and 2010 were 79 billion for 2011 net income attributable to kinder morgan inc totaled 594 million as compared to a net loss of 41 million in 2010 

  

for 2010 our net income attributable to kinder morgan inc was negatively impacted by i a 128 million aftertax going private transaction litigation settlement ii approximately 107 million aftertax from a reduction in the income we recognized from our interest in the general partner due to a kmp distribution of cash from interim capital transactions and iii approximately 275 million aftertax from an investment impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2010 

total segment ebda increased 535 million 21 in 2011 compared to 2010 however this overall increase in earnings i included a 202 million increase in ebda from the effect of the certain items described in footnote b to the table above which combined to decrease total segment ebda by 374 million and 576 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively and ii exclude 23 million decrease in ebda from discontinued operations as described in footnote e to the table above and excluding the 10 million increase in expense in 2011 from the writeoff of a receivable for fuel undercollected prior to 2011 the two primary certain items contributing to the 576 million decrease in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization for 2010 were i a 430 million pretax impairment of our investment in ngpl holdco llc and ii a 172 million pretax expense associated with the products pipelinekmp litigation after adjusting for these two items the remaining 310 million 9 increase in total segment ebda in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted from better performance from all five of kmp’s reportable business segments primarily due to increases attributable to the co 2 —kmp natural gas pipelines and terminals—kmp business segments 

  

impact of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss 

  

the impacts of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss before dda relate primarily to the revaluation of the accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives accounted for as hedges in the co 2 —kmp and natural gas pipelines segments where there is an impact to segment earnings loss before dda from the going private transaction the impact is described in the individual business segment discussions which follow the effects on dda expense result from changes in the carrying values of certain tangible and intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 this revaluation results in changes to dda expense in periods subsequent to may 30 2007 the purchase accounting effects on “unallocable interest and other net” result principally from the revaluation of certain debt instruments to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 resulting in changes to interest expense in subsequent periods 

  

segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses 

  

certain items included in earnings from continuing operations are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance in general the items not included in segment results are interest expense general and administrative expenses dda and unallocable income taxes these items are not controllable by our business segment operating managers and therefore are not included when we measure business segment operating performance our general and administrative expenses include such items as employee benefits insurance rentals

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate servicesincluding accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment earnings before dda in relation to the level of capital employed because kmp’s and epb’s partnership agreements require them to distribute 100 of their available cash to their partners on a quarterly basis kmp’s and epb’s available cash consists primarily of all of its cash receipts less cash disbursements and changes in reserves we consider each period’s earnings before all noncash depreciation depletion and amortization expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our segments that are also segments of kmp we account for intersegment sales at market prices we account for the transfer of net assets between entities under common control by carrying forward the net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination transfers of net assets between entities under common control do not affect the income statement of the combined entity

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

 the overall yeartoyear decrease in ebda from discontinued operations was largely due to the loss of income due to the sale of our discontinued operations effective november 1 2012 ebda from the kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system the trailblazer pipeline system and kmp’s investment in the rockies express pipeline system decreased 29 million 33 20 million 59 and 17 million 19 respectively in 2012 versus 2011 in addition to the loss of income due to our divestiture earnings from both pipeline systems decreased during the ten months we owned the assets in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the decrease was driven by lower operating revenues in 2012 generally related to lower net fuel recoveries lower margins on operational natural gas sales and excess natural gas transportation capacity existing out of the rocky mountain region relative to 2011

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

the primary increases and decreases in the natural gas pipelines business segment’s ebda from discontinued operations in 2011 compared to 2010 were attributable to the following 

 the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses from continuing operations in both pairs of comparable years primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group with the variances from yeartoyear in both revenues and operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group’s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold the intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas which is often stored andor transported on its pipelines and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased the increases and decreases in its natural gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in its natural gas purchase costs it realizes earnings by capturing the favorable differences between the changes in its gas sales prices purchase prices and transportation costs including fuel the intrastate group accounted for 54 92 and 95 respectively of the segment’s revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 and 81 98 and 99 respectively of the segment’s operating expenses in 2012 2011 and 2010

the overall increases in ebda from the terminals kmp segment were driven by higher contributions from the terminal facilities included in the gulf liquids midatlantic and northeast regions the increase from the gulf liquids facilities were driven by higher warehousing revenues as a result of new and renewed customer agreements at higher rates at the galena park and pasadena texas facilities higher ethanol volumes through the deer park texas rail terminal and higher overall gasoline throughput volumes kmp also benefited from both higher capitalized overhead associated with the ongoing construction of kmp’s majorityowned battleground texas oil terminal located on the houston ship channel and higher earnings from its crude oil storage operations located in cushing oklahoma 

the yeartoyear earnings increase from the midatlantic region resulted primarily from higher export coal shipments from the pier ix terminal located in newport news virginia and higher import steel and iron ore imports from the fairless hills pennsylvania bulk terminal economic expansion in developing countries has generated a growth cycle in the coal export market due both to this growth in demand and to completed infrastructure expansions since the end of 2011 kmp’s total export coal volumes for all terminals combined increased by 57 million tons 38 in 2012 when compared to the prior year 

the increase in earnings from the northeast terminal operations was driven by higher contributions from the staten island terminal due to new and favorable contract changes despite being affected heavily by hurricane sandy in 2012 the liquid terminal in carteret new jersey increased earnings primarily due to higher transfer and storage rates and to new and renegotiated contracts kmp also benefited from incremental earnings from the philadelphia liquids terminal due largely to new and restructured customer contracts at higher rates and from the perth amboy new jersey liquids terminal due primarily to higher gasoline throughput volumes and favorable contract changes 

the incremental earnings and revenues from acquired assets and businesses primarily represent contributions from kmp’s additional equity investment in the shortline railroad operations of watco companies llc acquired in december 2011 and its bulk terminal that handles petroleum coke for the total refinery in port arthur texas acquired in june 2011 the incremental amounts represent earnings and revenues from acquired terminals’ operations during the additional months of ownership in 2012 and do not include increases or decreases during the same months kmp owned the assets in 2011 

the remaining increases and decreases in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings and revenues—reported in the “all others” line in the table above—represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations however the overall decreases were driven by lower results from the combined terminal operations included in the rivers region the decreases were mainly due to lower domestic coal transload volumes largely the result of a drop in domestic demand relative to 2011

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

year ended december 31 2011 versus year ended december 31 2010 

  



the increase in earnings from the terminals included in the midatlantic region was driven by an 18 million increase from the pier ix terminal located in newport news virginia pier ix benefitted from a 21 million increase in operating revenues that related chiefly to a 52 million ton 74 increase in coal transload volumes the increase in volumes was due to the ongoing domestic economic recovery growth in the export market due to greater foreign demand for both us metallurgical and steam coal and completed terminal expansions since the end of 2010 including all terminals coal volumes handled increased by 20 in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

the incremental earnings and revenues from acquired assets and businesses primarily represent contributions from i kmp’s initial equity investment in watco companies llc acquired in january 2011 ii the port arthur petroleum coke bulk terminal acquired in june 2011 and discussed above and iii the bulk and liquids terminal assets it acquired from slay industries in march 2010 for more information on kmp’s 2011 terminal acquisitions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

the increase in earnings from the northeast terminals was primarily due to a 7 million increase from the carteret new jersey liquids terminal driven by both completed liquids tank expansion projects since the end of 2010 which increased liquids storage capacity by approximately one million barrels and higher transfer and storage rates including all terminals kmp increased its liquids terminals’ leasable capacity by 20 million barrels 34 during 2011 via both terminal acquisitions and completed terminal expansion projects and at the same time its overall liquids utilization capacity rate the ratio of kmp’s actual leased capacity to its estimated potential capacity at the end of 2011 decreased by only 17 since the end of 2010 

  

the increase in earnings from the gulf liquids terminals primarily related to higher operating results from kmp’s galena park and pasadena liquids facilities driven by higher ethanol volumes higher distillate warehousing revenues and new and renewed customer agreements at higher rates kmp also benefitted from the march 2011 completion of its deer park rail terminal and its related ethanol handling assets at the pasadena terminal for all of the gulf liquids terminals combined total ethanol handling volumes increased by 86 in 2011 compared to 2010 

  

the overall increase in earnings from the midwest terminals was mainly due to higher earnings from the combined operations of the argo and chicago illinois liquids terminals due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business and to higher contributions from the dakota bulk terminal located in st paul minnesota due to higher sand and salt transload volumes 

  

the increase in earnings from the southeast terminals was due mainly to higher chemical revenues increased salt handling and higher storage fees at the shipyard river terminal located in charleston south carolina and from higher margins from tank blending services involving various agricultural products at the liquids terminal facility located in wilmington north carolina 

  

higher overall earnings from the terminals—kmp segment in 2011 versus 2010 were partially offset by lower earnings from terminal operations included in the segment’s ohio valley and west regions due mainly to both lower revenues earned 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

from steel handling and iron ore stevedoring services and lower agricultural exports due to higher soybean meal exports during 2010 as a result of drought conditions in south america 

  

the remaining increases and decreases in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings and revenues—reported in the “all others” line in the table above—represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations however the decrease in revenues relate largely to terminal assets kmp sold or contributed to joint ventures and no longer consolidate since the end of 2010 

kinder morgan canada—kmp 

  



 

 

the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment includes the operations of the trans mountain and jet fuel pipeline systems and kmp’s onethird ownership interest in the express crude oil pipeline system the certain items relating to income tax savings described in footnote a to the table above accounted for both a 3 million decrease in segment ebda in 2012 and a 3 million increase in ebda in 2011 when compared with the respective prior year 

  

following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 30 million 15 and 17 million 9 increases in ebda and ii 9 million 3 and 34 million 13 increases in operating revenues in both 2012 and 2011 when compared with the respective prior year 

  

year ended december 31 2012 versus year ended december 31 2011 

  



the yeartoyear increase in trans mountain’s ebda was driven by a 17 million decrease in income tax expenses associated primarily with favorable tax adjustments recorded in 2012 related to lower taxable income relative to 2011 trans mountain also benefited from higher nonoperating income related primarily to incremental management incentive fees earned from its operation of the express pipeline system the yearoveryear increase in earnings from the equity investment in the express pipeline system was mainly due to volumes moving at higher transportation rates on the express canadian portion of the system and to higher domestic volumes on the platte domestic portion of the segment

the overall increase in trans mountain’s ebda in 2011 compared to 2010 included an increase of 5 million due to favorable currency impacts primarily related to favorable changes from the translation of earnings 

  

trans mountain’s remaining 16 million yearoveryear increase in ebda was driven by higher operating revenues primarily due to favorable impacts from a negotiated pipeline toll settlement agreement which became effective on january 1 2011 the oneyear negotiated toll agreement was formally approved by the national energy board canada on april 29 2011 and replaced the previous mainline toll settlement agreement that expired on december 31 2010 

  

the decrease in earnings from kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system was driven by a 5 million increase in income tax expenses due to a drop in income tax expense in 2010 related to a valuation allowance release on previously established deferred tax balances the overall decrease in earnings was partially offset by a 1 million increase in equity earnings primarily due to higher domestic transportation volumes on the platte pipeline segment 

  

other 

during 2012 our other segment activities include those operations that were acquired from ep on may 25 2012 and are primarily related to several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with ep’s legacy trading activities these contracts obligate ep to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028 in 2010 this segment primarily consisted of our power facility which was sold on october 22 2010 this segment also included an interest in the bolivia to brazil pipeline which we sold for 88 million on january 18 2013 there were earnings contributions of 7 million and 4 million respectively from this segment for the years ended 2012 and 2010

combined the certain items described in footnotes a and b to the table above affected kmi’s general and administrative expenses by a 263 million increase in 2012 when compared with 2011 the remaining changes in kmi’s general and administrative expense in 2012 were primarily related to ep’s excluding epb and the dropdown asset group general and administrative expense 

combined the certain items described in footnote a and b to the table above decreased kmi’s general and administrative expenses by 225 million in 2011 when compared with 2010 kmi’s remaining general and administrative expenses in 2011 was approximately flat when compared with 2010 

combined the certain items described in footnote c to the table above decreased kmp’s general and administrative expenses by 24 million in 2012 and increased kmp’s general and administrative expenses by 84 million in 2011 when compared with the respective prior year the remaining 44 million 12 increase in general and administrative expenses in 2012 versus 2011 was driven by kmp’s acquisition of additional business associated primarily with the tennessee gas and el paso natural gas 50 interest pipeline systems it acquired from us effective august 1 2012 kmp also realized higher benefit and payroll tax expenses and higher employee labor expenses which were impacted by cost inflation increases on workbased health and insurance benefits higher wage rates and a larger yearoveryear labor force the remaining 14 million 4 increase in general and administrative expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by i a combined 11 million increase due to higher employee benefits and payroll tax expenses due mainly to both cost inflation increases on workbased health and insurance benefits and higher wage rates ii higher overall salary and labor expenses and iii higher environmental and pension expenses related to kmp’s canadian pipeline operations 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount combined the certain items described in footnotes e and f to the table above affected kmi’s interest expense by a 128 million increase in 2012 when compared with 2011 our remaining combined interest expense net of interest income increased 608 million 87 in 2012 when compared with 2011 the combined interest expense net of interest income and the item described in footnote f increased by 34 million 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 which was primarily attributable to higher average kmp borrowings 

the increase in kmi’s interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to interest expense incurred from i ep acquisition debt and ii debt assumed in the ep acquisition see notes 3 “acquisition and divestitures—kmi acquisition of el paso corporation” and note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the increase in kmi interest expense in 2011 was primarily due to a 7 increase in average borrowings between 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the 200 million going private litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2010 

for both pairs of comparable years the increase in kmp’s interest expense was attributable to higher average borrowings kmp’s average debt balances increased 18 in 2012 and 10 in 2011 when compared to the respective prior year the increases in average borrowings were largely due to the capital expenditures external business acquisitions including debt assumed from the dropdown transaction and investment contributions kmp has made since the beginning of 2010 

the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowingsincluding both shortterm and longterm amountswas essentially flat across both 2012 and 2011 but decreased by 2 in 2011 versus 2010 the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowings was 424 during 2012 426 during 2011 and 435 during 2010 the lower average rate in 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in the variable interest rate kmp paid on the borrowings made under its commercial paper program as compared to borrowing under its revolving bank credit facility in 2010 

we and kmp use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt and as of december 31 2012 approximately 42 of kmi’s and 39 of kmp’s debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rateseither as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps epb did not have variable rate debt obligations as of december 31 2012   as of december 31 2011 approximately 35 of kmi’s and 47 of kmp’s debt balances excluding debt fair value adjustments were subject to variable interest rates for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 13 “risk managementinterest rate risk management” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income or loss attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries primarily kmp and epb that are not held by us increased 46 million 70 for 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase for 2012 is primarily due to the additional income from acquisitions partially offset by noncash loss of 937 million from both the costs to sell and a remeasurement of the ftc natural gas pipeline disposal group net assets to fair value the decrease of 275 million 81 for 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to a 168 million increase in expense associated with kmp rate case liability adjustments a 60 million increase in expense associated with kmp rightsofway lease payment liability adjustments as well as a 167 million noncash loss from the remeasurement of kmp’s previously held 50 equity interest in kinderhawk field services llc to fair value partially offset by kmp’s 172 million increase in expense associated with rate case liability adjustments in 2010 

income taxes—continuing operations 

  

year ended december 31 2012 versus year ended december 31 2011 

our income tax expense for income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2012 was 139 million as compared with 2011 income tax expense of 361 million the 222 million decrease in tax expense is due primarily to i lower income attributable to kmi as a result of costs incurred in 2012 to facilitate the ep acquisition and a 200 million impairment of our ngpl investment and ii a 2012 adjustment to decrease our income tax reserve for uncertain tax positions these decreases are partially offset by i a 2012 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability for a change in non taxdeductible goodwill related to our investment in kmp and ii the tax impact of an increase in the deferred state tax rate in 2012 as a result of the ep acquisition 

year ended december 31 2011 versus year ended december 31 2010 

  

our tax expense from income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2011 was 361 million as compared with 2010 tax expense of 166 million the 195 million increase is primarily due to i the tax impact of significantly higher pretax earnings attributable to kmi in 2011 as compared to 2010 ii the impact of nondeductible costs incurred to facilitate our initial public offering and the pending ep acquisition iii a 2010 adjustment recorded to decrease our deferred tax liability related to our investment in ngpl and iv a 2011 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmp these increases are partially offset by i adjustments to decrease our income tax reserve in 2011 for uncertain tax positions ii an increase to deferred taxes related to an increase in our state tax rate in 2010 and iii a 2010 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmr 

as explained in the kmi dividends section discussion above after our initial public offering we intend periodically to sell the kmr shares we receive as distributions from kmr since we no longer expect to recover our investment in kmr in a taxfree manner a deferred tax liability was recorded resulting in a 80 million increase to income tax expense in 2010

liquidity and capital resources 

  

general 

  

our acquisition of ep on may 25 2012 resulted in significant changes in our consolidated financial position and our future cash requirements as of december 31 2012 we had a combined 714 million of “cash and cash equivalents” on our consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this report an increase of 303 million 74 from december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 kmi also had 638 million of borrowing capacity available under its 175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility kmp had approximately 14 billion of borrowing capacity available under its 22 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” and epb through its whollyowned subsidiary el paso pipeline partners operating company llc eppoc had approximately 992 million of borrowing capacity available under its 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below in “—liquidity” we believe that our cash position and remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations and currently we believe our liquidity to be adequate 

  

we have relied primarily on cash provided from operations to fund our operations as well as our debt interest payments sustaining capital expenditures quarterly dividend payments and our subsidiaries’ quarterly distributions 

  

expansion capital expenditures and debt principal payments as such debt principal payments become due have historically been funded by us and our subsidiaries through i additional borrowings including commercial paper issuances by kmp ii 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

the issuance of additional common stock by us iii issuance of shares by kmr with proceeds used for its purchase of additional kmp iunits and iv issuance of common units by kmp or epb 

in addition kmp has funded a portion of its historical expansion capital expenditures with retained cash which results primarily from including iunits owned by kmr in the determination of kmp’s cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on iunits in additional iunits rather than cash 

  

in addition to results of operations our epb and kmp’s debt and capital balances are affected by financing activities as discussed below in “—financing activities” 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings affect our ability to access the public and private debt markets including the commercial paper market by kmp as well as the terms and pricing of our debt see part ii item 1a “risk factors” based on our and our subsidiaries’ credit ratings as discussed below we and our subsidiaries expect that our respective shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through shortterm borrowings nevertheless our and our subsidiaries’ ability to satisfy financing requirements or fund planned capital expenditures including planned expenditures of our joint ventures will depend upon future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy pipeline and terminals industries and other financial and business factors some of which are beyond our control 

on july 17 2012 moody’s investors service moody’s downgraded our senior secured debt ratings to ba2 from ba1 with a negative outlook this action concludes the review that was initiated on october 18 2011 after kmi agreed to purchase 100 of the stock of ep other actions taken by moody’s included placing ep’s ratings on review for upgrade and the affirmation of the senior unsecured ratings for kmp at baa2 and epb at ba1 on august 17th 2012 moody’s upgraded ep’s rating to ba2 after kmi finalized the guarantee of ep’s debt on february 27 2013 moodys modified its rating on our senior secured debt ratings from a negative to a positive outlook 

as a result of the july 17 2012 downgrade on our senior secured debt ratings the interest rate on our 175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility 364day bridge credit facility and 50 billion 3year term loan facility increased by 50 basis points effective july 17 2012 the 364day bridge facility was paid off and terminated and the 50 billion 3year term loan facility was paid down by 23 billion in august 2012 see note 3 “acquisitions and divestitures—dropdown of ep assets to kmp”   included elsewhere in this report in november 2012 the terms of kmi’s 175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility were amended to decrease the fixed spread component of our floating interest rate by 100 basis points and to extend the maturity of the credit facility to december 31 2014 

a number of affiliated companies had their ratings changed the most notable being the upgrade in epb’s ratings from bb to bbb stable by standards  poor’s ratings services sp as a result of the ep acquisition and an upgrade for tennessee gas pipeline company tgp and el paso natural gas company epng associated with the august 13 2012 dropdown transaction of 100 of tgp and 50 of epng from us to kmp subsequent to that transaction tgp’s rating was upgraded to bbb stable by sp and baa1 stable by moody’s epng’s rating was upgraded by moody’s to baa1 stable 

currently kmp’s longterm corporate debt credit rating is bbb stable baa2 stable and bbb stable at sp moody’s and fitch inc respectively its shortterm corporate debt credit rating is a2 susceptible to adverse economic conditions however capacity to meet financial commitments is satisfactory prime2 strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations and f2 good quality grade with satisfactory capacity to meet financial commitments at sp moody’s and fitch inc respectively currently epb’s longterm corporate debt rating is bbb stable ba1 positive and bbb stable at sp moody’s and fitch inc respectively 

shortterm liquidity 

as of december 31 2012 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity were i kmi’s 175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ii kmp’s 22 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks iii kmp’s 22 billion shortterm commercial paper program which was supported by its credit facilities described that matures july 1 2016 with the amount available for borrowing under its credit facility being reduced by its outstanding commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit iv epb’s 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and v cash from operations the facilities can be used for the respective entity’s general corporate or partnership purposes and kmp’s facility can be used as a backup for its shortterm commercial paper program in addition kmp’s 22 billion longterm senior unsecured revolving credit facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to 25 billion and epb’s credit facility is expandable to 15 billion for certain expansion projects and acquisitions we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our credit facilities discussed following additionally we have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 2795 million in 2012 and 2366 million in 2011 respectively the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “—operating activities” 

  

the following represents our primary revolving credit facilities that were available to kmi and its subsidiaries kmp and epb debt outstanding under the credit facilities including commercial paper borrowings and available borrowing capacity under the facilities after deducting i outstanding letters of credit and ii outstanding borrowings under kmi and epb’s credit facilities and kmp’s commercial paper program supported by its credit facility 



our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2012 was 2401 million primarily consisting of i 1656 million combined outstanding borrowings under kmi’s 175 billion credit facility and kmp’s 22 billion commercial paper program and ii 500 million in principal amount of kmp’s 50 senior notes that mature on december 15 2013 kmp’s outstanding shortterm debt will be refinanced by the combination of longterm debt equity andor the issuance of additional commercial paper borrowings or credit facility borrowings kmi intends to refinance its shortterm debt through additional credit facility borrowings to replace maturing credit facility borrowings issuing new longterm debt or with proceeds from asset sales 

our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2011 was 2899 million primarily consisting of i 421 million in outstanding borrowings under kmi’s senior secured credit facility ii 839 million remaining principal amount of kmi’s 650 senior notes that matured on september 1 2012 iii 645 million of kmp’s commercial paper borrowings iv 450 million in principal amount of kmp’s 7125 senior notes that matured march 15 2012 and v 500 million in principal amount of kmp’s 585 senior notes that matured september 15 2012 

  

we had working capital deficits of 1535 million and 2866 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the overall 1331 million 46 favorable change from yearend 2011 was primarily due to the 498 million decrease in shortterm debt discussed above and the favorable working capital impact of the ep acquisition 

generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of debt or equity issuances discussed below in “—longterm financing” 

  

kmp and epb independent of kmp employ centralized cash management programs for their us—based bank accounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of their operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing kmp’s and epb’s centralized cash management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of their operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within their consolidated group kmp and epb do not place material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities however kmp and epb’s cash and the cash of their subsidiaries are not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in its consolidated group of companies and kmi has no rights with respect to kmp and epb’s cash except as permitted pursuant to their respective partnership agreements 

  

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

furthermore certain of kmp and epb’s operating subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

  

longterm financing 

  

from time to time kmi kmp or epb issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of the senior notes of kmi kmp or epb issued to date other than those issued by kmp and epb subsidiaries and its operating partnerships generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums kmi and its subsidiaries’ other than kmp and its subsidiaries and epb and its subsidiaries senior notes are secured equally and ratably with kmi’s 175 billion senior secured revolving credit facility all of kmp and epb’s outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of its other senior debt obligations a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of kmp’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries all of the fixed rate senior notes of kmi kmp or epb provide that the notes may be redeemed at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a makewhole premium 

as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 the balances of longterm debt including the current portion and the preferred interest in the general partner of kmp but excluding debt fair value adjustments was 30154 million and 15094   million respectively to date our and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness 

based on our historical record we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives we and our subsidiaries including kmp and epb are subject however to conditions in the equity and debt markets and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the equity markets we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings furthermore our subsidiaries’ ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by their respective credit ratings 

kmi and some of its direct and indirect subsidiaries referred to as the combined other guarantor subsidiaries guarantee the payment of certain of el paso llc’s formerly known as el paso corporation outstanding debt as of the successor date of august 13 2012 each series of el paso llc outstanding notes totaling approximately 41 billion in aggregate principal amount is guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by kmi and the combined other guarantor subsidiaries see note 20 “guarantee of securities of subsidiaries” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

for additional information about our debtrelated transactions in 2012 see note 8 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

capital expenditures 

  

we define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset generally we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations in addition to utilizing cash 

generated from their own operations certain of our subsidiaries can each fund their own cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures with proceeds from issuing their own longterm notes or with proceeds from contributions received from us or their other member owners 

  

all of our and our subsidiaries’ capital expenditures with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures are classified as discretionary generally we initially fund our discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under our credit facilities or commercial paper program for kmp until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively issue either debt or equity or both 

  

 our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the amount we forecast to spend for 2013 to sustain and grow our business are as follows

the foregoing list should not be construed to be exhaustive we believe the forwardlooking statements in this report are reasonable however there is no assurance that any of the actions events or results of the forwardlooking statements will occur or if any of them do what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition because of these uncertainties you should not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements 

  

see item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed description of these and other factors that may affect the forwardlooking statements when considering forwardlooking statements one should keep in mind the risk factors described in item 1a “risk factors” the risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement other than as required by applicable law we disclaim any obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements to reflect future events or developments 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

  

energy commodity market risk 

  

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream stated another way we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil the derivative contracts that we or kmp use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and overthecounter markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

as part of the ep acquisition see note 3 “acquisitions and divestiture—kmi acquisition of el paso corporation” we acquired longterm natural gas and power forward and swap contracts prior to the acquisition ep had entered into offsetting positions that eliminated the price risks associated with its power contracts and substantially offset the fixed price exposure related to its natural gas supply contracts none of these derivatives are designated as accounting hedges 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas kmp often enters into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of its crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of its natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby directly offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s ratings services 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us and our subsidiaries to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet distribution targets we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream stated another way we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil the derivative contracts that we or kmp use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and overthecounter markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

as part of the ep acquisition see note 3 “acquisitions and divestiture—kmi acquisition of el paso corporation” we acquired longterm natural gas and power forward and swap contracts prior to the acquisition ep had entered into offsetting positions that eliminated the price risks associated with its power contracts and substantially offset the fixed price exposure related to its natural gas supply contracts none of these derivatives are designated as accounting hedges 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas kmp often enters into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of its crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of its natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby directly offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

  

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

  

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s ratings services 



as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows which helps us and our subsidiaries to undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet distribution targets we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but which value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  continued 

in accounting for cash flow hedges gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income outside “net income” reported in our consolidated statements of income but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income that is for cash flow hedges all effective components of the derivative contracts’ gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income pending occurrence of the expected transaction other comprehensive income consists of those financial items that are included within “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are included within “noncontrolling interests” and are not included in our net income thus in highly effective cash flow hedges where there is no ineffectiveness other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss in addition when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “noncontrolling interests” and are transferred to the income statement as well effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales depreciation interest expense etc for more information on our other comprehensive income and our “accumulated other comprehensive loss” see notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas crude oil and power derivative instruments portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model the sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss ie the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio based upon a hypothetical 10 movement in the underlying quoted market prices in addition to these variables the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values as of both december 31 2012 and 2011 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity natural gas prices would affect the estimated fair value of natural gas derivatives held by us and kmp by 7 million and 4 million respectively as of both december 31 2012 and 2011 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity crude oil prices would affect the estimated fair value of crude oil derivatives held by kmp by 196 million and 194 million respectively as of december 31 2012 a hypothetical 10 movement in underlying commodity electricity prices would affect the estimated fair value of our power derivatives by 2 million as discussed above we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and therefore both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 

our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the 

natural gas crude oil and power portfolios of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year for more information on our energy commodity risk management activities see note 13 to our consolidated statements included elsewhere in this report 

interest rate risk 

  

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

  

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until such debt is required to be refinanced 

  

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying values of the fixed rate debt including the debt fair value adjustments included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets were 29554 million and 16100 million respectively these 

kinder morgan inc form 10k 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  continued 

amounts compare to as of december 31 2012 and 2011 fair values of 31882 million and 16462 million respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2012 and 2011 would result in changes of approximately 1048 million and 575 million respectively in the fair values of these instruments 

the carrying value of the variable rate debt which approximates the fair value excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following was 4847 million and 1155 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2012 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 7250 million and 5525 million respectively as of december 31 2011 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of 7250 million and 5325 million respectively an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal which is called the notional principal amount normally at each payment or settlement date the party who owes more pays the net amount so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 49 basis points in 2012 and approximately 44 basis points in 2011 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 and 2011 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 55 million and 32 million respectively in our 2012 and 2011 annual pretax earnings 

as of december 31 2012 epb had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding in september 2012 epb terminated its existing variabletofixed interest rate swap agreements having a notional principal amount of  137 million  and paid  14 million  for the early termination of these swap agreements 

interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

  

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time through our subsidiaries may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements in general kmp attempts to maintain an overall target mix of approximately 50 fixed rate debt and 50 of variable rate debt and typically kmi excluding kmp targets well below that level for variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 approximately 42 of kmi’s debt excluding that of kmp and epb is variable rate debt

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control – integrated framework  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012 

  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their audit report which appears herein 

we acquired ep in a purchase business combination on may 25 2012 ep is a whollyowned subsidiary and we excluded this business from the scope of our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 ep total assets and total revenues represent 56 and 19 respectively of our related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2012

pending acquisition of el paso corporation 

 

on october 16 2011 we and el paso corporation nyse ep announced a definitive agreement whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ep ep owns north america’s largest interstate natural gas pipeline system one of north america’s largest independent exploration and production companies and an emerging midstream business ep also owns a 42 percent limited partner interest and the 2 percent general partner interest in el paso pipeline partners lp nyseepb 

 

 

as of the announcement date the total purchase price including the assumption of debt outstanding at ep and the debt outstanding at epb was approximately 38 billion under the terms of the transaction the consideration to be received by the ep shareholders is valued at 2687 per ep share based on kmi’s closing price as of october 14 2011 representing a 47 percent premium to the 20day average closing price of ep common shares and a 37 percent premium over the closing price of ep common shares on october 14 2011 the offer is comprised of 1465 in cash 04187 kmi class p shares valued at 1126 per ep share and 0640 kmi warrants valued at 096 per ep share based on kmi’s closing price on october 14 2011 the warrants will have an exercise price of 40 and a fiveyear term ep shareholders will be able to elect for each ep share held either i 2591 in cash ii 09635 kmi class p shares or iii 1465 in cash plus 04187 kmi class p shares all elections will be subject to proration and in all cases ep shareholders will receive 0640 kmi warrants per share of ep common stock

on february 10 2012 we entered into i an amendment to our existing 10 billion revolving credit facility to permit among other things the transactions contemplated by the e p merger agreement and to fund in part the transactions and related costs and expenses ii an incremental joinder agreement which provides for 750 million in additional commitments under our existing revolving credit facility and iii an acquisition debt facilities credit agreement containing a 68 billion 364day facility and a 50 billion 3year term loan facility the proceeds of which will be used to finance a portion of the cash consideration and related fees and expenses to be paid in connection with the ep acquisition all of the foregoing will be effective upon completion of the ep acquisition 

 

the transaction has been approved by each company’s board of directors prior to closing the transaction will require approval of both kmi and ep shareholders the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals 

 

the opportunity to sell dropdown ep’s natural gas pipeline assets to kmp and epb and sell ep’s exploration and production business and the availability of certain net operating loss carryforwards to help offset taxable gains in connection with such sales is expected to reduce substantially the level of indebtedness incurred to finance the transactions 

 

initial public offering 

 

on february 16 2011 we completed an initial public offering of common stock see notes 1 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

our assets that currently generate cash for the payment of dividends and for other purposes consist primarily of our ownership of the general partner interest in kmp approximately 11 of the limited partner interests of kmp and a 20 interest in ngpl pipeco llc approximately 98 and 97 of the distributions we received from our subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were attributable to kmp 

 

description of business 

 

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets and through our ownership of the general partner of kmp and kmr’s management of kmp’s operations is built to support two principal components 

 

 

 

 

 

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines bulk and liquids terminal facilities and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition during the historical periods presented prior to 2011 in this report we had a business segment referred to as power which consisted of our ownership of natural gasfired electric generation facilities on october 22 2010 we sold our facility located in michigan referred to as triton power for approximately 150 million in cash and as a result we no longer report power as a business segment see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states’ and canada’s various energy businesses and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and a portion of the business portfolio including the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment the canadian portion of the cochin pipeline and bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currencybased transactions both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in uscanadian dollar exchange rates to help understand our reported operating results all of the following references to ‘‘foreign currency effects’’ or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results in us dollars resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar the references are made to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 

 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 

 

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly in the texas intrastate pipeline business we currently derive approximately 75 of our sales and transport margins from longterm transport and sales contracts that include requirements with minimum volume payment obligations as contracts expire we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2011 the remaining average contract life of kmp’s natural gas transportation contracts including its intrastate pipelines was approximately eight years 

 

the co 2   sales and transportation business primarily has contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2011 had a remaining average contract life of four years this remaining average contract life includes intercompany sales when we eliminate intercompany sales the remaining average contract life is approximately five years carbon dioxide sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil but with a floor price on a volumeweighted basis for contracts making deliveries in 2012 and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our 2012 budget approximately 70 of our contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee or floor price and 30 fluctuate with the price of oil these percentages include intercompany sales when we eliminate intercompany sales the percentages are 72 and 28 respectively in the longterm our success in this business is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide however shortterm changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2 —kmp business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in 

 

  

  

 

addition the revenues we receive from our crude oil natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was 6973 per barrel in 2011 5996 per barrel in 2010 and 4955 per barrel in 2009 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 9261 per barrel in 2011 7693 per barrel in 2010 and 5902 per barrel in 2009 

 

the factors impacting the terminals—kmp business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums because these contracts are volume based above the minimums our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which is typically approximately four years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods continuing its history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses in 2011 we invested approximately 26 billion for both strategic business acquisitions and expansions of existing assets kmp’s capital investments helped it to achieve compound annual growth rates in cash distributions to its limited partners of 48 47 and 72 respectively for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2011 

 

thus kmp’s ability to increase distributions to us and other investors will to some extent be a function of its ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions we believe kmp will continue to have opportunities for expansion of its facilities in many markets and it has budgeted approximately 17 billion for its 2012 capital expansion program including small acquisitions and investment contributions based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 

 

in addition kmp regularly considers and enters into discussions regarding potential acquisitions including those from us or our affiliates and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets such transactions can be effected quickly may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations kmp’s ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost and includes factors over which we have limited or no control thus we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 

 

kmp’s ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand its assets is impacted by its ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions as a master limited partnership kmp distributes all of its available cash and it accesses capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions historically kmp has succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund its acquisitions and expansions and although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit we believe that kmp’s stable cash flows its investment grade credit rating and its historical record of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow it to continue to execute its current investment distribution and 

 

  

  

 

acquisition strategies as well as refinance maturing debt when required for a further discussion of our liquidity including kmp’s public debt and equity offerings in 2011 please see “—liquidity and capital resources” below 

 

dividend policy 

 

our dividend policy set forth in our shareholders agreement provides subject to applicable law that we will pay quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our capital stock equal to the cash we receive from our subsidiaries and other sources less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes the division of our dividends among our classes of capital stock will be in accordance with our charter our board of directors may declare dividends by a majority vote in accordance with our dividend policy pursuant to our bylaws this policy reflects our judgment that our stockholders would be better served if we distributed to them a substantial portion of our cash as a result we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities including acquisitions 

 

as presented in the table at the end of this section for the year ended december 31 2011 we had cash available to pay distributions of 8353 million exceeding our budget of 820 million as discussed below our dividend for the first quarter of 2011 paid on may 16 2011 was prorated for the time we have been public dividends on our investor retained stock generally will be paid at the same time as dividends on our common stock and will be based on the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock is convertible on the record date for the applicable dividend 

 

the portion of our dividends payable on the three classes of our investor retained stock may vary among those classes but the variations will not affect the dividends we pay on our common stock since the total number of shares of common stock into which our outstanding investor retained stock can convert in the aggregate was fixed on the closing of our initial public offering on february 16 2011 as of december 31 2011 investor retained stock was convertible into a fixed aggregate of 535972387 shares of our common stock which represent 757 of our common stock on a fullyconverted basis subsequent to our initial public offering any conversion of our investor retained stock into our common stock reduces on a one for one basis the number of common shares into which our investor retained stock can convert such that the number of shares on a fully converted basis is the same before and after the conversion of our investor retained stock 

 

our board of directors may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason which would require a supermajority board approval while the sponsor investors consisting of investment funds advised by or affiliated with goldman sachs  co highstar capital lp the carlyle group and riverstone holdings llc maintain prescribed ownership thresholds during that time supermajority approval would also be required to declare and pay any dividends that are not in accordance with our dividend policy there is nothing in our dividend policy or our governing documents that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities our capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors distributions we receive from kmp are our most significant source of our cash available to pay dividends including the value of additional kmr shares we receive on the approximately 141 million shares we own we intend periodically to sell the kmr shares we receive as distributions to generate cash 

 

on february 11 2011 our board of directors declared and paid a dividend to our then existing investors of 2458 million with respect to the period for which we were not public this consisted of 2050 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 1048 million for the first 46 days of 2011 representing the portion of the first quarter of 2011 that we were not public less a onetime adjustment of 640 million in available earnings and profits reserved for the after tax cost of special cash bonuses and premium pay in an aggregate amount of approximately 100 million that was paid in may of 2011 to certain of our nonsenior management employees no holders of our class b shares or class c shares received such bonuses 

 

subsequent to the offering and through december 31 2011 we paid dividends totaling 5238 million or 074 per common share which consisted of i the initial quarterly dividend of 014 per share for the first quarter of 2011 representing a prorated amount for the period during the first quarter that we were public and ii quarterly dividends of 030 per share with respect to the second and third quarters of 2011 on january 18 2012 our board of directors declared a dividend of 031 per share 124 annualized for the fourth quarter of 2011 paid on february 15 2012 to shareholders of record as of january 31 2012

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of us generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

 

environmental matters 

 

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 

 

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 

 

these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management’s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

legal matters 

 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time is reasonably possible to occur and may require substantial expenditures we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 

 

as of december 31 2011 kmp’s most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved its west coast products pipelines transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and 

 

  

  

 

the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines’ interstate and intrastate california rates respectively for more information on regulatory proceedings see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year there were no impairment charges resulting from our may 31 2011 impairment testing and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date for more information on our goodwill see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer contracts relationships and agreements lease value and technologybased assets these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for more information on our amortizable intangibles see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

 

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

 

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves please see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

hedging activities 

 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of us generally accepted accounting principles to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

 

since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices—a perfectly effective hedge—we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for example when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations accordingly our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges for more information on our hedging activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

  

  

 

employee benefit plans 

 

with respect to the amount of income or expense we recognize in association with our pension and retiree medical plans we must make a number of assumptions with respect to both future financial conditions for example medical costs returns on fund assets and market interest rates as well as future actions by plan participants for example when they will retire and how long they will live after retirement most of these assumptions have relatively minor impacts on the overall accounting recognition given to these plans but two assumptions in particular the discount rate and the assumed longterm rate of return on fund assets can have significant effects on the amount of expense recorded and liability recognized we review historical trends future expectations current and projected market conditions the general interest rate environment and benefit payment obligations to select these assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report while we believe our choices for these assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances other assumptions could be reasonably applied and therefore we note that at our current level of pension and retiree medical funding a change of 1 in the longterm return on assets assumption would increase decrease our annual retiree medical expense by approximately 06 million 06 million and would increase decrease our annual pension expense by 25 million 25 million in comparison to that recorded in 2011 similarly a 1 change in the discount rate would increase decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 85 million 77 million and would increase decrease our projected pension benefit obligation by 394 million 352 million compared to those balances as of december 31 2011 

 

income taxes 

 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments including our investment in kmp the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investment in kmp 

 

going private transaction 

 

a going private transaction completed in may 2007 see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report was accounted for as a purchase business combination accordingly our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the going private transaction with the excess of the purchase price over these combined fair values recorded as goodwill

year ended december 31 2011 vs 2010 

 

our total revenues for 2011 and 2010 were 83 billion and 82 billion respectively for 2011 net income attributable to kinder morgan inc totaled 5944 million as compared to net loss of 413 million in 2010 

 

total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses sometimes referred to as ebda increased 5016 million 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 however this overall increase in earnings included an increase of 1912 million from the effect of the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above which combined to decrease total segment ebda by 3846 million and 5758 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the remaining 3104 million 9 increase in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted from better performance from all five of kmp’s reportable business segments primarily due to increases attributable to the co 2 —kmp 1332 million natural gas pipelines—kmp 1152 million and terminals—kmp 546 million business segments 

 

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

our total revenues for 2010 and 2009 were 82 billion and 72 billion respectively for 2010 the net loss attributable to kinder morgan inc totaled 413 million as compared to income of 4950 million in 2009 net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for 2010 was negatively impacted by i a 128 million aftertax going private transaction litigation settlement ii approximately 107 million aftertax from a reduction in the income we recognized from our interest in the general partner due to a kmp distribution of cash from interim capital transactions and iii approximately 275 million aftertax from an investment impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2010 

 

total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization decreased 2784 million 9 in 2010 compared to 2009 and the overall decrease included a decrease in earnings of 6171 million from the effect of the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above combining to affect total segment ebda by a 5758 million decrease and a 413 million increase in 2010 and 2009 respectively the two primary items described in the footnotes to the table above contributing to the 5758 million decrease in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization for 2010 were i a 430 million pretax impairment of our investment in ngpl pipeco llc and ii a 172 million pretax expense associated with the products pipeline—kmp litigation the remaining 3387 million 11 increase in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2010 versus 2009 resulted from better performance from all five of kmp’s reportable business segments mainly due to increases attributable to the co 2 —kmp and terminals—kmp business segments the going private transaction litigation settlement and kmp interim capital transaction discussed in footnotes j and l to the above table respectively did not impact earnings before dda 

 

  

  

 

during 2010 kmp benefitted from i higher revenues from crude oil natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales due largely to the positive impact of higher energy prices—primarily in the last six months of the year—relative to 2009 ii incremental earnings from the shale gas gathering and treating services offered by the kinder morgan natural gas treating operations and kmp’s 50owned kinderhawk field services iii higher revenues from refined petroleum products delivery revenues by kmp’s west coast products pipelines and higher earnings from ethanol related handling activities at its west coast and southeast products terminal operations iv the positive impact from a full year of operations from kinder morgan louisiana and kmp’s 50owned midcontinent express natural gas pipeline systems and v incremental earnings from both newly acquired and expanded bulk and liquids terminal operations 

 

impact of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss 

 

the impacts of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss before dda relate primarily to the revaluation of the accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives accounted for as hedges in the co 2 —kmp and natural gas pipelines—kmp segments where there is an impact to segment earnings loss before dda from the going private transaction the impact is described in the individual business segment discussions which follow the effects on dda expense result from changes in the carrying values of certain tangible and intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 this revaluation results in changes to dda expense in periods subsequent to may 30 2007 the purchase accounting effects on “unallocable interest and other net” result principally from the revaluation of certain debt instruments to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 resulting in changes to interest expense in subsequent periods 

 

segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses 

 

certain items included in earnings from continuing operations are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance in general the items not included in segment results are interest expense general and administrative expenses dda and unallocable income taxes we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment earnings before dda in relation to the level of capital employed because kmp’s partnership agreement requires it to distribute 100 of its available cash to its partners on a quarterly basis kmp’s available cash consists primarily of all of its cash receipts less cash disbursements and changes in reserves we consider each period’s earnings before all noncash depreciation depletion and amortization expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our segments that are also segments of kmp we account for intersegment sales at market prices we account for the transfer of net assets between entities under common control by carrying forward the net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination transfers of net assets between entities under common control do not affect the income statement of the combined entity 

 

  

  

 

products pipelines—kmp 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above accounted for decreases in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 425 million in 2011 1395 million in 2010 when compared with the respective prior year following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 69 million 1 and 524 million 8 increases in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and ii 310 million 4 and 564 million 7 increases in operating revenues in both 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year

natural gas pipelines—kmp 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above accounted for i decreases of 1713 million and 82 million respectively in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2011 and 2010 and ii a decrease of 04 million and an increase of 04 million respectively in segment revenues in 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year 

 

following is information related to the segment’s remaining i 1152 million 14 and 484 million 6 increases in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and ii 1510 million 3 decrease and 6092 million 16 increase in operating revenues in 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year

the primary increases and decreases in the natural gas pipelines—kmp business segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 were attributable to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales in both pairs of comparable years primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group with the variances from yeartoyear in both revenues and operating expenses mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group’s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold kmp’s intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas which is often stored andor transported on its pipelines and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased the increases and decreases in its natural gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in its natural gas purchase costs it realizes earnings by capturing the favorable differences between the changes in its gas sales prices purchase prices and transportation costs including fuel kmp’s intrastate group accounted for 85 88 and 89 respectively of the segment’s revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 and 93 94 and 95 respectively of the segment’s operating expenses in 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

 

co 2 —kmp 

 

 

 

 

the co 2 —kmp segment’s primary businesses involve the production marketing and transportation of both carbon dioxide commonly called co 2  and crude oil and the production and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids we refer to the segment’s two primary businesses as its oil and gas producing activities and sales and transportation activities 

 

combined the unrealized gains and losses and valuation adjustments on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted crude oil sales and described in footnote a to the table above decreased both earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and revenues by 353 million and 241 million respectively in 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior years for each of the segment’s two primary businesses following is information related to the remaining i 1332 million 14 and 1638 million 21 increases in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and ii 1706 million 14 and 1912 million 18 increases in operating revenues in both 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year 

 

  

  

 

year ended december 31 2011 versus year ended december 31 2010 

 

 

the segment’s oil and gas producing activities include the operations associated with its ownership interests in oilproducing fields and natural gas processing plants and generally earnings from these activities are closely aligned with realized price levels for crude oil and natural gas liquids products when compared to 2010 the increase in earnings from the segment’s oil and gas producing activities in 2011 was mainly due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses from the segment’s sales and transportation activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

the segment’s overall increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher earnings from both its oil and gas producing activities and its sales and transportation activities the yearoveryear increase in earnings from oil and gas producing activities was due mainly to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly the 491 million 23 yearoveryear increase in earnings from the segment’s sales and transportation activities in 2010 was also largely revenue related chiefly due to a 375 million 22 increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues the increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues was driven by a 22 increase in the average sales price for carbon dioxide although kmp’s carbon dioxide sales volumes were essentially unchanged across both years kmp benefitted from higher average carbon dioxide sales prices in 2010 versus 2009 due to both continued strong customer demand for carbon dioxide’s use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area and to the positive impact on the portion of its carbon dioxide sales contracts that were tied to crude oil prices which increased since the end of 2009 

 

pipeline revenues from transporting both carbon dioxide and crude oil were essentially flat across 2010 and 2009 and for the co 2 —kmp segment combined total carbon dioxide delivery volumes decreased almost 3 in 2010 versus 2009 the decrease in delivery volumes was mainly due to lower consumption of new carbon dioxide at both the sacroc and yates field units however carbon dioxide production from its southwest colorado source fields increased in 2010 and carbon dioxide delivery volumes on kmp’s 50owned cortez pipeline increased by 05 in 2010 both reflecting a slight increase in thirdparty sales compared to 2009 

 

kmp’s sales and transportation activities also benefitted from a 50 million 123 decrease in income tax expenses in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to favorable adjustments to the segment’s accrued texas margin tax liabilities in 2010 due to prior year overpayments 

 

terminals—kmp 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

the terminals—kmp business segment includes the operations of petroleum chemical and other liquids terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines—kmp segment and all of coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk material services facilities kmp groups its bulk and liquids terminal operations into regions based on geographic location andor primary operating function this structure allows the management to organize and evaluate segment performance and to help make operating decisions and allocate resources 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above accounted for an 72 million increase in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 and a 265 million decrease in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2010 compared to 2009 following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 546 million 8 and 704 million 12 increases in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and ii 495 million 4 and 1561 million 14 increases in operating revenues in both 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2011 versus year ended december 31 2010 

 

 

 

  

  

 

the increase in earnings from the terminals included in the midatlantic region was driven by an 181 million increase from the pier ix terminal located in newport news virginia pier ix benefitted from a 211 million increase in operating revenues that related chiefly to a 52 million ton 74 increase in coal transload volumes the increase in volumes was due to the ongoing domestic economic recovery growth in the export market due to greater foreign demand for both us metallurgical and steam coal and completed terminal expansions since the end of 2010 including all terminals coal volumes handled increased by 20 in 2011 compared to 2010 

 

during 2011 kmp acquired certain terminal assets and businesses in order to gain access to new markets and to complement andor enlarge its existing terminal operations and combined these acquired operations contributed incremental earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of 154 million and incremental revenues of 122 million in 2011 all of the incremental amounts represent the earnings and revenues from acquired terminals’ operations during the additional months of ownership in 2011 and do not include increases or decreases during the same months kmp owned the assets in 2010 for more information on the terminal acquisitions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

the increase in earnings from the northeast terminals was driven by a 72 million increase from the carteret new jersey liquids terminal driven by both completed liquids tank expansion projects since the end of 2010 which increased liquids storage capacity by approximately one million barrels and higher transfer and storage rates including all terminals kmp increased its liquids terminals’ liquids leasable capacity by 20 million barrels 34 during 2011 via both terminal acquisitions and completed terminal expansion projects and at the same time its overall liquids utilization capacity rate the ratio of kmp’s actual leased capacity to its estimated potential capacity at the end of 2011 decreased by only 17 since the end of 2010 

 

the 84 million increase in earnings from the gulf liquids terminals primarily related to higher operating results from kmp’s two large liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel driven by higher ethanol volumes higher distillate warehousing revenues and new and renewed customer agreements at higher rates kmp also benefitted from the march 2011 completion of its deer park rail terminal and its related ethanol handling assets at the pasadena terminal for all of the gulf liquids terminals combined total ethanol handling volumes increased by 86 in 2011 compared to 2010 

 

the overall increase in earnings from the midwest terminals was mainly due to higher earnings from the combined operations of the argo and chicago illinois liquids terminals due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business and to higher contributions from the dakota bulk terminal located in st paul minnesota due to higher sand and salt transload volumes 

 

the increase in earnings from the southeast terminals was due mainly to higher chemical revenues increased salt handling and higher storage fees at the shipyard river terminal located in charleston south carolina and from higher margins from tank blending services involving various agricultural products at the liquids terminal facility located in wilmington north carolina 

 

higher overall earnings from the terminals—kmp segment in 2011 versus 2010 were partially offset by lower earnings from terminal operations included in the segment’s ohio valley and west regions due mainly to both lower revenues earned from steel handling and iron ore stevedoring services and lower agricultural exports due to higher soybean meal exports during 2010 as a result of drought conditions in south america 

 

the remaining increases and decreases in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings and revenues—reported in the “all others” line in the table above—represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations however the decrease in revenues relate largely to terminal assets kmp sold or contributed to joint ventures and no longer consolidate since the end of 2010 

 

  

  

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the overall increase in the terminals—kmp segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 versus 2009 was driven by incremental earnings from the terminal assets and businesses kmp acquired during 2010 combined these acquired operations contributed incremental earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of 322 million and revenues of 592 million in 2010   all of the incremental amounts represent the earnings and revenues from acquired terminals’ operations during the additional months of ownership in 2010 and do not include increases or decreases during the same months kmp owned the assets in the prior year 

 

the earnings increase in 2010 compared to 2009 from the gulf liquids terminals was driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues mainly due to new and incremental customer agreements at higher rates and to the completion of various terminal expansion projects that increased liquids tank capacity since the end of 2009 for all liquids terminals combined kmp increased its liquids leasable capacity by 18 million barrels 32 during 2010 and at the same time its overall liquids utilization capacity rate at the end of 2010 decreased by only 04 since the prior yearend 

 

the increase in earnings from the west region terminals was driven by incremental contributions from i the vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal located on the north shore of vancouver british columbia canada’s main harbor ii the kinder morgan north 40 terminal the crude oil tank farm kmp constructed near edmonton alberta canada iii the washington state terminals located in vancouver and longview washington and iv the portland oregon bulk terminal the combined increase in earnings was mainly due to higher transfer volumes of agricultural products and other bulk and liquids commodities higher rate tonnage and for the two canadian terminals favorable currency translation impacts from a strengthening of the canadian dollar since the end of 2009 

 

earnings from the southeast midriver and ohio valley terminals which are located in the southeast and central regions of the us also increased in 2010 due largely to increased steel volumes from rebounding steel consumption consistent with the ongoing economic recovery during 2010 for the terminals—kmp segment combined total steel tonnage increased by 80 million tons 48 in 2010 when compared with the previous year 

 

the increase in earnings from the ethanol terminals was driven by incremental services offered by kmp’s unit train terminaling facilities located at richmond and lomita california in march 2010 kmp began operations at its newlybuilt richmond terminal which is serviced by the burlington northern santa fe railroad the increase in earnings from the lomita rail ethanol terminal was largely due to incremental offloading and distribution volumes driven by california’s growing demand for reformulated fuel blend ethanol for the terminals—kmp segment combined ethanol volumes increased by 253 million barrels 78 in 2010 primarily due to the growth in demand from the state of california and to the incremental handling activities from the terminal assets kmp acquired from us development group llc in january 2010 

 

for 2010 earnings from the lower river louisiana terminal operations decreased compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from both the international marine terminals imt facility a multiproduct importexport facility located in port sulphur louisiana and owned 66 23 by kmp and the westwego louisiana liquids terminal the decrease in imt’s earnings was due to both a general loss in business in 2010 and a 32 million property casualty gain recognized in 2009 on a vessel dock that was damaged in march 2008 in september 2010 imt experienced a catastrophic failure of its shiploader which negatively impacted its ability to load vessels the decrease in earnings from the westwego facility was primarily due to lower revenues resulting from a drop in petroleum fuel storage 

 

  

  

 

kinder morgan canada—kmp 

 

 

 

 

the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment includes the operations of the trans mountain and jet fuel pipeline systems and kmp’s onethird ownership interest in the express crude oil pipeline system the certain items relating to “income tax expense” described in footnote a to the table above accounted for increases in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses of 31 million in 2011 and 112 million in 2010 when compared with the respective prior year 

 

following is information related to the segment’s i remaining 169 million 9 and 159 million 10 increases in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization and ii 339 million 13 and 424 million 19 increases in operating revenues in both 2011 and 2010 when compared with the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2011 versus year ended december 31 2010 

 

 

the overall increase in trans mountain’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 included an increase of 44 million due to favorable currency impacts primarily related to favorable changes from the translation of earnings 

 

trans mountain’s remaining 161 million yearoveryear increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization was driven by higher operating revenues primarily due to favorable impacts from a negotiated pipeline toll settlement agreement which became effective on january 1 2011 the oneyear negotiated toll agreement was formally approved by the national energy board canada on april 29 2011 and replaced the previous mainline toll settlement agreement that expired on december 31 2010 

 

the decrease in earnings from kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system was driven by a 54 million increase in income tax expenses due to a drop in income tax expense in 2010 related to a valuation allowance release on previously established deferred tax balances the overall decrease in earnings was partially offset by a 12 million increase in equity earnings primarily due to higher domestic transportation volumes on the platte pipeline segment 

 

  

  

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the increase in the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by higher earnings from the trans mountain pipeline system and kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system the overall 98 million 6 increase in trans mountain’s earnings in 2010 consisted of a 228 million 15 increase due to higher operating income revenues less operating expenses and a combined 130 million 373 decrease due to both lower income from foreign currency transactions included in nonoperating other income and higher income tax expenses 

 

the increase in operating income and related income tax expenses was driven by higher crude oil volumes moving across trans mountain’s marine dock located in port metro vancouver system throughput volumes increased by 6 overall compared to 2009 the decrease in income from foreign currency transactions was primarily attributable to lower currency gains on trans mountain’s outstanding shortterm intercompany interest obligations payable in us dollars although the canadian dollar did strengthen during 2010 gains from the revaluation of usbased interest liabilities were lower in 2010 because the impact was not as favorable as in 2009 

 

the overall increase in earnings from kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system included a 55 million increase due to lower yearoveryear income tax expenses in 2010 and a 12 million increase due to higher interest income earned from kmp’s longterm debt investment in express the drop in income tax expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by the valuation allowance release on deferred tax balances described above and the increase in interest income was due to favorable currency translation impacts in 2010

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

2010 includes a noncash impairment charge of 4300 million following is information related to the decrease in ngpl pipeco llc’s net income and other measurements at the 100 ownership level which when multiplied by our 20 ownership interest equals the remaining decrease of 115 million 27 in our equity earnings for 2010 when compared to 2009 

 

for 2010 ngpl pipeco llc’s net income before impairment charges decreased by 574 million 27 from 2126 million for 2009 to 1552 million for 2010 results for 2010 relative to 2009 were negatively impacted by an 885 million reduction in gross margin from 8769 million in 2009 to 7884 million in 2010 primarily resulting from reduced rates and volumes on transportation and storage services and a reduction in net fuel collections these reductions are partially attributable to the settlement of ngpl pipeco llc’s section 5 rate proceeding that became effective in the third quarter of 2010 as discussed above and lower contracted rates and volumes on the system in 2010 than in 2009 in addition 2010 earnings were negatively impacted by i a 130 million increase in operating expenses due in part to increased pipeline system integrity management and testing programs and other pipeline operations costs and ii a 29 million net decrease in other pretax income these negative impacts were partially offset by a 470 million reduction in income tax expense principally due to a reduction in pretax income and the inclusion in 2009 results of an increase in tax expense associated with a deferred tax liability adjustment due to an effective tax rate increase 

 

other 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses unallocable interest income and income tax expense interest expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employeerelated expenses payroll taxes insurance office supplies and rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services—including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

 

combined the certain items described in footnote a to the table above decreased kmi’s general and administrative expenses by 2126 million in 2011 and increased kmi’s general and administrative expenses in 2010 by 2097 million when compared with the respective prior year kmi’s remaining general and administrative expenses in 2011 and 2010 were approximately flat when compared with the respective prior years 

 

combined the certain items described in footnote c to the table above increased kmp’s general and administrative expenses by 836 million in 2011 and 36 million in 2010 when compared with the respective prior year the remaining 139 million 4 increase in kmp’s general and administrative expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by i a combined 108 million increase due to higher employee benefits and payroll tax expenses due mainly to both cost inflation increases on workbased health and insurance benefits and higher wage rates ii higher overall salary and labor expenses and iii higher environmental and pension expenses related to kmp’s canadian pipeline operations 

 

for 2010 compared to 2009 the remaining 413 million 13 increase in kmp’s expenses included increases of i 219 million from higher employee benefit and payroll tax expenses ii 57 million from higher overall corporate insurance expenses and iii 52 million from higher unallocated legal expenses the increase in benefit and payroll tax expenses was mainly due to the overall variability in yearoveryear health and medical costs higher wage rates and a larger yearoveryear labor force the increase in insurance expenses was primarily due to higher expense accruals in 2010 related mainly to yearoveryear increases in commercial property and liability insurance costs and partly to incremental premium taxes the increase in legal expenses was primarily due to higher outside legal services 

 

in the table above we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income and capitalized interest from our interest expense to arrive at one interest amount and after taking into effect the certain items described in footnote d to the table above the combined unallocable interest expense net of interest income increased by 358 million 6 in 2011 compared to 2010 and 720 million 13 in 2010 compared to 2009 for both pairs of comparable years the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher average kmp borrowings 

 

kmp’s average debt balances increased 10 in 2011 and 16 in 2010 when compared to the respective prior year the increases in average borrowings were largely due to the capital expenditures external business acquisitions and investment contributions kmp has made since the beginning of 2009 for more information on kmp’s capital expenditures capital contributions and acquisition expenditures see “—liquidity and capital resources” 

 

  

  

 

the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowings—including both shortterm and longterm amounts—decreased by 2 in 2011 and by 5 in 2010 when compared with the respective prior year the weighted average interest rate on all of kmp’s borrowings was 426 during 2011 435 during 2010 and 457 during 2009 the decreases were due primarily to a general drop in variable interest rates since the beginning of 2009 including decreases in the variable interest rate kmp paid on the borrowings made under its revolving bank credit facility and in 2011 and 2010 under its commercial paper program 

 

the increase in kmi interest expense in 2011 was primarily due to a 7 increase in average borrowings between 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the 200 million going private litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

we and kmp use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt and as of december 31 2011 approximately 35 of kmi’s and 47 of kmp’s debt balances of 33064 million and 127973 million respectively excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps

income taxes—continuing operations 

 

year ended december 31 2011 vs 2010 

 

our tax expense from income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2011 was approximately 3628 million as compared with 2010 tax expense of 1676 million the 1952 million increase is primarily due to i the tax impact of significantly higher pretax earnings attributable to kmi in 2011 as compared to 2010 ii the impact of nondeductible costs incurred to facilitate our initial public offering and the pending acquisition of ep iii a 2010 adjustment recorded to decrease our deferred tax liability related to our investment in ngpl and iv a 2011 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmp these increases are partially offset by i adjustments to decrease our income tax reserve in 2011 for uncertain tax positions ii an increase to deferred taxes related to an increase in our state tax rate in 2010 and iii a 2010 adjustment to increase the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmr as discussed below 

 

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

the 1590 million decrease in tax expense to 1676 million for 2010 is primarily due to i a decrease in pretax income due to the going private transaction litigation settlement see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies ― going private litigation” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report ii a decrease in pretax income due to a lower distribution from kmp for the third quarter of 2010 as a result of an interim capital transaction iii a decrease in pretax income due to a 4300 million impairment of our investment in ngpl see note 6 “investments ―ngpl ” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report iv lower state income taxes v an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities related to certain kinder morgan canada subsidiaries vi adjustments to the deferred tax liability related to our investments in ngpl triton power and our employee benefit trust vii lower adjustments in 2010 to trueup our book tax provision to the federal and state tax returns filed and viii changes in nondeductible goodwill related to our investment in kmp the decrease is partially offset by i a lower dividendsreceived deduction relative to lower dividends received from our 20 ownership interest in ngpl ii the impact on deferred taxes of an increase in our state tax rate iii adjustments to our reserve for uncertain tax positions and iv an adjustment to the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmr as discussed following 

 

  

  

 

as explained in our dividend policy and distributions discussion below after our initial public offering we intend periodically to sell the kmr shares we receive as distributions from kmr since we no longer expect to recover our investment in kmr in a taxfree manner a deferred tax liability was recorded resulting in a 795 million increase to income tax expense in 2010

liquidity and capital resources 

 

general 

 

as of december 31 2011 we had a combined 4114 million of “cash and cash equivalents” on our consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this report a decrease of 910 million from december 31 2010 as of december 31 2011 kmi also had 05 billion of borrowing capacity available under its 10 billion senior secured revolving credit facility and kmp had approximately 13 billion of borrowing capacity available under its 22 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below in “—shortterm liquidity” we believe that our cash position and remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations and currently we believe our liquidity to be adequate 

 

the primary cash requirements for us and our subsidiaries in addition to normal operating expenses are for debt service sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset expansion capital expenditures kmp’s quarterly distributions to its public common unitholders and our quarterly dividends to our shareholders

in addition to results of operations our and kmp’s debt and capital balances are affected by financing activities as discussed below in “—financing activities” 

 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

 

as part of kmp’s financial strategy it tries to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating which involves among other things the issuance of additional kmp limited partner units in connection with its acquisitions and expansion activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate kmp’s outstanding debt and its cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings currently kmp’s longterm corporate debt credit rating is bbb stable baa2 negative and bbb stable at standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service inc and fitch inc respectively on october 18 2011 in response to our announcement that we have reached an agreement to purchase 100 of the outstanding stock of ep moody’s revised its outlook on kmp’s longterm credit rating to negative from stable the rating agency’s revision reflected its view that the 

 

  

  

 

increased leverage at kmi associated with this acquisition will put additional strain on kmp’s ability to upstream cash to kmi further information about this announcement is described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

kmp’s shortterm corporate debt credit rating is a2 susceptible to adverse economic conditions however capacity to meet financial commitments is satisfactory prime2 strong ability to repay shortterm debt obligations and f2 good quality grade with satisfactory capacity to meet financial commitments at standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service inc and fitch inc respectively based on these credit ratings kmp expects that its shortterm liquidity needs will be met primarily through borrowings under its commercial paper program nevertheless kmp’s ability to satisfy its financing requirements or fund planned capital expenditures will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy pipeline and terminals industries and other financial and business factors some of which are beyond its control 

 

additionally some of kmp’s customers are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness these financial problems may arise from current global economic conditions changes in commodity prices or otherwise kmp has been and is working to implement to the extent allowable under applicable contracts tariffs and regulations prepayments and other security requirements such as letters of credit to enhance its credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers kmp cannot provide assurance that one or more of its current or future financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to it or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows however kmp has no material concentrations of credit risk and kmp believes it has provided adequate allowance for such customers 

 

shortterm liquidity 

 

as of december 31 2011 our principal sources of shortterm liquidity were kmi’s revolving credit facility kmp’s revolving credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks and cash from operations the facilities can be used for the respective entity’s general corporate or partnership purposes and kmp’s facility can be used as a backup for its shortterm commercial paper program kmp’s facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to 25 billion we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our credit facilities discussed following additionally we have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations providing a source of funds of 23651 million in 2011 and 19088 million in 2010 the yeartoyear increase is discussed below in “—operating activities” 

 

the following represents the revolving credit facilities that were available to kmi and its subsidiary kmp shortterm debt outstanding under the credit facilities including commercial paper borrowings and available borrowing capacity under the facilities after deducting i outstanding letters of credit and ii outstanding borrowings under kmi’s credit facility and kmp’s commercial paper program 

 

 

our combined balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2011 was 28986 million primarily consisting of i 4207 million in outstanding borrowings under kmi’s senior secured credit facility ii 8393 million remaining principal amount of kmi’s 650 series notes that mature on september 1 2012 iii 6448 million of kmp’s commercial paper borrowings due in part to its shortterm credit rating upgrade in february 2011 kmp made no shortterm borrowings under its revolving credit facility in 2011 but instead made borrowings under its commercial paper program iv 4500 million in principal amount of kmp’s 7125 senior notes that mature march 15 2012 and v 5000 million in principal amount of kmp’s 585 senior notes that mature september 15 2012 as of december 31 2010 our combined outstanding shortterm debt was 20133 million kmp intends to refinance its current shortterm debt through a combination of longterm debt equity additional commercial paper borrowings or credit facility 

 

  

  

 

borrowings kmi intends to refinance its shortterm debt through additional credit facility borrowings andor the issuance of additional longterm debt 

 

we had working capital deficits of 28657 million as of december 31 2011 and 18572 million as of december 31 2010 the 10085 million 54 increase in our working capital deficit from yearend 2010 was primarily due to i an 8393 million reclassification to current maturities of kmi’s 650 series notes that mature on september 1 2012 ii a 2500 million net increase in the current maturities of kmp’s longterm debt and iii a 1227 million increase in kmp’s net commercial paper borrowings offset somewhat by a 2802 million increase in kmp’s “cash and cash equivalents” 

 

generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of debt or equity issuances discussed below in “—longterm financing” although working capital can be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its shortterm cash needs a working capital deficit is not unusual for us or for other companies similar in size and scope to us furthermore we believe that our working capital deficit does not indicate a lack of liquidity as we continue to maintain adequate current assets and committed lines of credit to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due 

 

kmp employs a centralized cash management program for its usbased bank accounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of its operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing kmp’s centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of its operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated consolidated or otherwise made available for use by other entities within its consolidated group kmp does not place material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities however kmp’s cash and the cash of its subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in its consolidated group of companies and kmi has no rights with respect to kmp’s cash except as permitted pursuant to its partnership agreement 

 

furthermore certain of kmp’s operating subsidiaries are subject to fercenacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs fercregulated entities subject to these rules must among other things place their cash management agreements in writing maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 

 

longterm financing 

 

from time to time kmi or kmp issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of the senior notes of kmi or kmp issued to date other than those issued by kmp’s subsidiaries and its operating partnerships generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums kmi and its subsidiaries’ other than kmp and its subsidiaries senior notes are secured equally and ratably with kmi’s 10 billion senior secured revolving credit facility all of kmp’s outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of its other senior debt obligations however a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of kmp’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries our and kmp’s fixed rate senior notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a makewhole premium for additional information on these debt securities and on the 2011 and 2010 debt related transactions including issuances of senior notes see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the balances of kmi and its subsidiaries’ excluding kmp and its subsidiaries’ longterm debt including the current portion purchase accounting adjustments on the carrying value of kmi’s debt and kmp’s debt and the preferred interest in the general partner of kmp but excluding the value of interest rate swaps was 28857 million and 36301 million respectively these balances included net unamortized purchase accounting adjustments decreasing the debt balances by 319 million and 375 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 the balances included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the various series of kmp’s various longterm borrowings including the current portion and excluding the value of interest rate swaps were 120260 million and 108767 million respectively to date our and our subsidiaries’ debt balances including kmp and its subsidiaries have not adversely affected our 

 

  

  

 

operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness based on our historical record we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives 

 

we and our subsidiaries including kmp are subject however to conditions in the equity and debt markets and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the equity markets we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings furthermore our subsidiaries’ ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by their respective credit ratings see “—credit ratings and capital market liquidity” above for a discussion of kmp’s credit ratings 

 

capital expenditures 

 

our sustaining capital expenditures—defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset—totaled 2127 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this amount included 99 million for kmp’s proportionate share of sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc ii midcontinent express pipeline llc iii fayetteville express pipeline llc iv cypress interstate pipeline llc v eaglehawk field services llc vi red cedar gathering company and vii for the first six months of 2011 only kinderhawk field services llc effective july 1 2011 kmp acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in kinderhawk that it did not already own and subsequently its sustaining capital expenditures are included in our consolidated totals 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our sustaining capital expenditures totaled 1808 million this amount included 02 million for kmp’s proportionate share of the sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc ii midcontinent express pipeline llc iii kinderhawk field services llc iv cypress interstate pipeline llc and v fayetteville express pipeline llc we have forecasted 2495 million for sustaining capital expenditures in our 2012 budget this amount includes 115 million for kmp’s proportionate share of its equity investees’ sustaining capital expenditures 

 

generally we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations in addition to utilizing cash generated from their own operations rockies express midcontinent express and fayetteville express can each fund their own cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under their own credit facilities with proceeds from issuing their own longterm notes or with proceeds from contributions received from their member owners kmp has no contingent debt obligations with respect to rockies express midcontinent express or fayetteville express for information on kmp’s contingent debt obligations see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

all of our capital expenditures with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures are classified as discretionary our discretionary capital expenditures totaled 9973 million in 2011 and 8219 million in 2010 the yeartoyear increase in discretionary capital expenditures was primarily due to higher investment undertaken in 2011 to expand and improve the products pipelines–kmp and co 2 –kmp business segments generally kmp initially funds its discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under its revolving credit facility or its commercial paper program until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt or equity or both kmp has forecasted 13230 million for discretionary capital expenditures in its 2012 budget this amount does not include forecasted discretionary expenditures by its equity investees forecasted capital contributions to its equity investees or forecasted expenditures for asset acquisitions 

 

capital contributions 

 

in addition to its discretionary capital expenditures kmp contributed a combined 3710 million to its equity investees in 2011 kmp’s 2011 contributions included payments of 1950 million to its 50owned fayetteville express pipeline llc and combined payments of 1355 million to its two equity investees that gather natural gas located in the eagle ford shale formation in south texas kmp’s 50owned eagle ford gathering llc and its 25owned eaglehawk field services llc fayetteville express used the contributions to repay borrowings under its previous 11 billion bank credit facility and subsequently entered into new borrowing facilities both eagle ford gathering and eaglehawk field services used kmp’s contributions as partial funding for natural gas gathering infrastructure expansions 

 

in 2010 kmp made equity investment contributions of 2993 million kmp’s 2010 contributions primarily consisted of a combined 2165 million contributed to rockies express pipeline llc and midcontinent express pipeline llc to partially fund its respective share of rockies express and midcontinent express natural gas pipeline system 

 

  

  

 

construction costs fayetteville express funded its 2010 natural gas pipeline construction costs with borrowings under its own 11 billion unsecured revolving bank credit facility 

 

generally kmp funds its equity investment contributions through borrowings under its commercial paper program or its bank credit facility to the extent these sources of funding are not sufficient kmp generally funds additional amounts through the issuance of longterm notes or its common units for cash 

 

capital requirements for recent transactions 

 

for each of the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 kmp’s net cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled   11787 million and 12132 million respectively kmp’s cash payments for acquired assets and investments in 2011 included i 8351 million for both kmp’s remaining 50 ownership interest in kinderhawk field services llc and its 25 interest in eaglehawk field services llc ii 1515 million for natural gas treating assets acquired from southtex treaters inc iii 1000 million for a preferred equity interest in watco companies llc and iv 429 million for terminal assets acquired from tgs development lp kmp also issued common units valued at 237 million as consideration kmp’s 2010 cash outlays for strategic business acquisitions primarily consisted of i 9214 million for its initial 50 ownership interest in kinderhawk ii 1143 million for three unit train ethanol handling terminals acquired from us development group llc kmp also issued common units valued at 817 million as consideration and iii 970 million for terminal assets and investments acquired from slay industries 

 

with the exception of the terminal assets which were partially acquired by the issuance of additional kmp common units kmp utilized its commercial paper program to fund its 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and then reduced its shortterm borrowings with the proceeds from its 2011 and 2010 equity and longterm senior notes issuances all of kmp’s significant 2011 and 2010 acquisitions are discussed further in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

this report includes forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts they use words such as “anticipate” “believe” “intend” “plan” “projection” “forecast” “strategy” “position” “continue” “estimate” “expect” “may” or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology in particular statements express or implied concerning future actions conditions or events future operating results or the ability to generate sales income or cash flow or to service debt or to pay dividends are forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance they involve risks uncertainties and assumptions future actions conditions or events and future results of operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forwardlooking statements many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict specific factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forwardlooking statements include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the foregoing list should not be construed to be exhaustive we believe the forwardlooking statements in this report are reasonable however t here is no assurance that any of the actions events or results of the forwardlooking statements will occur or if any of them do what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition because of these uncertainties you should not put undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements 

 

see item 1a “risk factors” for a more detailed description of these and other factors that may affect the forwardlooking statements when considering forwardlooking statements one should keep in mind the risk factors described in item 1a “risk factors” the risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statement other than as required by applicable law we disclaim any obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements to reflect future events or developments 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

 

energy commodity market risk 

 

we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks such as weatherrelated risk in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream stated another way we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us 

 

  

  

 

financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil the derivative contracts kmp uses include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and overthecounter markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas kmp often enters into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of its crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of its natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby directly offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

 

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 

 

the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s ratings services 

 

 

as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide kmp increased certainty with regard to its operating cash flows and helps it undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet distribution targets to its partners we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 

 

in accounting for cash flow hedges gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income loss outside “net income” reported in our consolidated statements of income but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income that is for cash flow hedges all effective components of the derivative contracts’ gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss pending occurrence of the expected transaction other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included within “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are included within “noncontrolling interests” and are not included in our net income thus in highly effective cash flow hedges where there is no ineffectiveness other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

 

all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss in addition when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “noncontrolling interests” and are transferred to the income statement as well effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales depreciation interest expense etc for more information on our other comprehensive income loss and our “accumulated other comprehensive loss” see notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

  

  

 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a valueatrisk model valueatrisk is a statistical measure estimating the probability of portfolio losses over a given holding period within a certain level of statistical confidence we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a quarterly basis our valueatrisk computations utilize a confidence level of 977 for the resultant price movement and we choose a holding period of one day for the calculation the confidence level used means that there is a 977 probability that the marktomarket losses for a single day will not exceed the valueatrisk number presented for each of the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 our valueatrisk reached a high of 94 million and 69 million respectively and a low of 30 million and 25 million respectively valueatrisk as of december 31 2011 was 30 million and averaged 68 million for 2011 valueatrisk as of december 31 2010 was 25 million and averaged 46 million for 2010 

 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on the combined portfolio of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts fixed price swaps basis swaps and overthecounter options and corresponding physical commodities assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

 

in addition as discussed above kmp enters into its derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of its business activities and therefore both in the valueatrisk calculation and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions for more information on our energy commodity risk management activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

 

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until such debt is required to be refinanced 

 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the carrying values of the fixed rate debt included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets were 149495 million and 145591 million respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2011 and 2010 fair values of 164618 million and 155183 million respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2011 and 2010 would result in changes of approximately   5748 million and 5303 million respectively in the fair values of these instruments the carrying value and fair value of the variable rate debt including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following was 11520 million and 5961 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

as of december 31 2011 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of 7250 million and 53 billion respectively as of december 31 2010 kmi and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of 7250 million and 48 billion respectively an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal which is called the notional principal amount normally at each payment or settlement date the party who owes more pays the net amount so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal a hypothetical 10 change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 44 basis points in 2011 and approximately 45 basis points in 2010 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 and 2010 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 316 million and 274 million respectively in our 2011 and 2010 annual pretax earnings 

 

interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows 

 

  

  

 

related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 

 

as of both december 31 2011 and 2010 all of kmi’s and kmp’s interest rate swap agreements represented fixedforvariable rate swaps where each agreed to pay its counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount comprised of principal amounts from various series of our longterm fixed rate senior notes in exchange the counterparties agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest thereby allowing fixed rate liabilities to transform into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 

 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time through our subsidiaries may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements in general kmp attempts to maintain an overall target mix of approximately 50 fixed rate debt and 50 of variable rate debt and typically kmi excluding kmp targets well below that level for variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 approximately 35 of kmi’s debt excluding that of kmp is variable rate debt 

 

as of both december 31 2011 and 2010 kmp’s cash and investment portfolio included 82 million in fixedincome debt securities these amounts are included within “investments” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at each reporting date and are not material to our consolidated balance sheets see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments for more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations from our executive officers and directors we believe that all section 16a filing requirements were met during 2011 

 




 item 11 executive compensation 

 

overview 

 

our executive officers have not received longterm compensation for serving in such capacities for us other than the receipt of kinder morgan holdco llc class a1 units and class b units in the going private transaction which converted into class c shares and class b shares respectively in connection with our initial public offering in addition to information regarding such compensation the following sets forth information regarding compensation earned by awarded to or paid to our executive officers in their capacities as executive officers of our subsidiaries or our affiliates including kmp sometimes collectively referred to in this section as the “kinder morgan affiliated entities” for the periods presented our executive officers also serve in the same capacities as executive officers of kinder morgan gp inc and kmr 

 

the compensation committee of the board of directors of kmr which committee is composed of three independent directors determines the compensation to be paid by kmp to kmr’s and kinder morgan gp inc’s executive officers as described below kmr’s compensation committee is aware of the compensation paid to such officers by entities such as us but makes its compensation determinations at its sole discretion 

 

compensation discussion and analysis 

 

program objectives 

 

we seek to attract and retain executives who will help us achieve our primary business strategy objective of growing the value of our portfolio of businesses for the benefit of our stockholders to help accomplish this goal we have designed an executive compensation program that rewards individuals with competitive compensation that consists of a mix of cash benefit plans and longterm compensation with a majority of executive compensation tied to the “at risk” portions of the annual cash bonus 

 

the key objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract motivate and retain executives who will advance our overall business strategies and objectives to create and return value to our stockholders we believe that an effective executive compensation program should link total compensation to financial performance and to the attainment of shortterm and longterm strategic operational and financial objectives we also believe it should provide competitive total compensation opportunities at a reasonable cost in designing our executive compensation program we have recognized that our executives have a much greater portion of their overall compensation atrisk than do our other employees consequently we have tried to establish the atrisk portions of our executive total compensation at levels that recognize their much increased level of responsibility and their ability to influence business results 

 

  

  

 

our executive compensation program is principally composed of the following two elements i base cash salary and ii possible annual cash bonus reflected in the summary compensation table below as nonequity incentive plan compensation we pay our executive officers a base salary not to exceed 300000 which we believe is below annual base salaries for comparable positions in the marketplace 

 

in addition we believe that the compensation of our chief executive officer chief financial officer and the executives named in the summary compensation table below collectively referred to in this item 11 as our “named executive officers” should be directly and materially tied to the financial performance of us and our affiliated entities and should be aligned with the interests of our shareholders therefore the majority of our named executive officers’ compensation is allocated to the “at risk” portion of our compensation program—the annual cash bonus accordingly for 2011 our executive compensation was weighted toward the cash bonus payable on the basis of the achievement of i a dividend per share target by us and ii a cash distribution per common unit target by kmp 

 

our compensation is determined independently without the use of any compensation surveys nevertheless we annually compare our executive compensation components with market information consisting of thirdparty surveys in which we participate the surveys we use in reviewing our executive compensation consist of the following i towers executive survey in which approximately 300 to 400 companies participate ii the hewitt executive survey in which approximately 400 companies participate and iii the natural gas transmission industries survey in which companies in the natural gas industry participate the purpose of this comparison is to ensure that our total compensation package operates effectively remains both reasonable and competitive with the energy industry and is generally comparable to the compensation offered by companies of similar size and scope as us we also keep abreast of current trends developments and emerging issues in executive compensation and if appropriate will obtain advice and assistance from outside legal compensation or other advisors 

 

we have endeavored to design our executive compensation program and practices with appropriate consideration of all tax accounting legal and regulatory requirements section 162m of the internal revenue code limits the deductibility of certain compensation for executive officers to 1000000 of compensation per year however if specified conditions are met certain compensation may be excluded from consideration of the 1000000 limit since the bonuses paid to our executive officers were paid under our annual incentive plan as a result of reaching designated financial targets established by our compensation committee we expect that all compensation paid to our executives would qualify for deductibility under federal income tax rules though we are advised that limited partnerships such as kmp are not subject to section 162m we and kmp have chosen to generally operate as if this code section does apply to kmp as a measure of appropriate governance 

 

behaviors designed to reward 

 

our executive compensation program is designed to reward individuals for advancing our business strategies and the interests of our stakeholders and it prohibits engaging in any detrimental activities such as performing services for a competitor disclosing confidential information or violating appropriate business conduct standards each executive is held accountable to uphold and comply with company guidelines which require the individual to maintain a discriminationfree workplace to comply with orders of regulatory bodies and to maintain high standards of operating safety and environmental protection 

 

unlike many companies we have no executive perquisites supplemental executive retirement nonqualified supplemental defined benefitcontribution deferred compensation or splitdollar life insurance programs for our executive officers we have no executive company cars or executive car allowances nor do we pay for financial planning services additionally we do not own any corporate aircraft and we do not pay for executives to fly first class we believe that this area of our overall compensation package is below competitive levels for comparable companies however we have no current plans to change our policy of not offering such executive benefits or perquisite programs 

 

we do not have employment agreements other than with richard d kinder or change of control agreements with our executive officers although the kmi class b shares held by our executive officers will no longer be subject to forfeiture upon a change of control of kmi in connection with our initial public offering we entered into severance agreements with eleven of our executive officers see “—other compensation—other potential postemployment benefits” 

 

at his request richard d kinder receives 1 of base salary per year from us additionally mr kinder has requested that he receive no annual bonus or other compensation from us or any of our affiliates other than the class b unit awards that he received in 2007 in connection with the going private transaction mr kinder does not have any deferred 

 

  

  

 

compensation supplemental retirement or any other special benefit compensation or perquisite arrangement with us and each year mr kinder reimburses us for his portion of health care premiums and parking expenses 

 

elements of compensation 

 

as outlined above our executive compensation program is principally composed of the following two elements i a base cash salary and ii a possible annual cash bonus with respect to our named executive officers other than the chief executive officer our and kmr’s compensation committees review and approve annually the financial goals and objectives of both us and kmp that are relevant to the compensation of our named executive officers 

 

the compensation committee solicits information from richard d kinder and james e street vice president human resources and administration with respect to the performance of c park shaper president and steven j kean executive vice president and chief operating officer similarly the compensation committee solicits information from messrs kinder shaper kean and street with respect to the performance of the other named executive officers the compensation committee also obtains information from mr street with respect to compensation of comparable positions of responsibility at comparable companies all of this information is taken into account by the compensation committee which makes final determinations regarding compensation of our named executive officers no named executive officer reviews his or her own performance or approves his or her own compensation 

 

furthermore if any of our executive officers is also an executive officer of kinder morgan gp inc or kmr the compensation determination or recommendation i may be with respect to the aggregate compensation to be received by such officer from us kmr and kinder morgan gp inc that is to be allocated among them or alternatively ii may be with respect to the compensation to be received by such executive officers from us kmr or kinder morgan gp inc as the case may be in which case such compensation will be allocated among us on the one hand and kmr and kinder morgan gp inc on the other 

 

in addition to the possible annual cash bonus discussed below and reflected in the summary compensation table as nonequity incentive plan compensation for the year ended december 31 2011 our compensation committee determined to award onetime cash bonuses to messrs shaper and listengart and mrs dang in respect of their efforts in kmi’s february 2011 initial public offering see “—summary compensation table” 

 

base salary 

 

base salary is paid in cash the base salary cap for our executive officers with the exception of our chairman and chief executive officer who receives 1 of base salary per year as described above is an annual amount not to exceed 300000 generally we believe that our executive officers’ base salaries are below base salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at companies of comparable size and scope based upon independent salary surveys in which we participate 

 

possible annual cash bonus nonequity cash incentive 

 

for the 2009 bonus year our possible annual cash bonus was provided for under kmk’s annual incentive plan which became effective january 18 2005 for the 2010 bonus year kmk’s board of directors approved a new annual incentive plan which became effective january 1 2010 for the 2011 bonus year our board of directors approved a new annual incentive plan that mirrored the previous plan the overall purpose of the annual incentive plan is to increase our executive officers’ and our employees’ personal stake in the continued success of kmp and us by providing to them additional incentives through the possible payment of annual cash bonuses under the plan a budget amount is established for annual cash bonuses at the beginning of each year that may be paid to our executive officers and other employees depending on whether we and our subsidiaries including kmp meet certain financial performance objectives as discussed below the amount included in our budget for bonuses is not allocated between our executive officers and nonexecutive officers assuming the financial performance objectives are met the budgeted pool of bonus dollars is further assessed and potentially increased if the financial performance objectives are exceeded the budget for bonuses also may be adjusted upward or downward based on our and our subsidiaries’ overall performance in other areas including but not limited to safety and environmental goals and regulatory compliance 

 

all of our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries including kmgp services company inc are eligible to participate in the plan except employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement unless such agreement expressly provides for eligibility under the plan however only eligible employees who are selected by kmr’s compensation committee will actually participate in the plan and receive bonuses 

 

  

  

 

the plan consists of two components the executive plan component and the nonexecutive plan component our chairman and chief executive officer and all employees who report directly to the chairman including all of our named executive officers are eligible for the executive plan component however as stated elsewhere in this “compensation discussion and analysis” richard d kinder has elected to not participate under the plan as of december 31 2011 excluding mr kinder eleven of our and our subsidiaries’ executive officers were eligible to participate in the executive plan component all other us and canadian eligible employees were eligible for the nonexecutive plan component 

 

at or before the start of each calendar year or later to the extent allowed under internal revenue code regulations financial performance objectives based on one or more of the criteria set forth in the plan are established by our compensation committee two financial performance objectives were set for 2011 under both the executive plan component and the nonexecutive plan component the two financial performance objectives were 

 

 

 

 

 

a third objective which could potentially decrease or increase the budgeted pool of bonus dollars for 2011 was a goal to improve our environmental health and safety performance by i beating industry average incident rates ii improving incident rates compared to our previous three year averages 

 

at the end of 2011 the extent to which the financial performance objectives have been attained and the extent to which the bonus opportunity has been earned under the formula previously established by our compensation committee was determined for 2011 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the above our compensation committee recommended that approximately 100 of the 2011 budgeted cash bonus opportunity be earned and funded under the plan an increase from the 2010 funding level of 93 the approved funding level includes any premium pay calculations for bonus awards paid to nonexempt employees 

 

in addition to determining the financial performance objectives under the annual incentive plan at or before the start of each calendar year the compensation committee sets the bonus opportunities available to each executive officer the table below sets forth the maximum bonus opportunities that could be payable by us and kmp collectively to our named executive officers for achievement of the threshold target and maximum 2011 financial performance objectives established under the plan if neither of the financial performance objectives was met no bonus opportunity would be available to our named executive officers the maximum payout to any individual under the plan for any year is 30 million the compensation committee may reduce the amount of the bonus actually paid to any executive officer from the amount of any bonus opportunity open to such executive officer because payments under the plan for our executive officers are determined by comparing actual performance to the performance objectives established each year for eligible executive officers chosen to participate for that year it is not possible to accurately predict any amounts that will actually be paid under the executive portion of the plan over the life of the plan the compensation committee set maximum bonus opportunities under the plan for 2011 for the executive officers at dollar amounts in excess of those which were expected to actually be paid under the plan in fact while achievement of the financial performance objectives sets the maximum bonus opportunity for each executive officer the compensation committee has never awarded the maximum bonus opportunity to a current named executive officer the actual payout amounts under the nonequity incentive plan awards made for 2011 paid in 2012 are set forth in the summary compensation table in the column entitled “nonequity incentive plan compensation” 

 

  

  

 

kinder morgan inc annual incentive plan bonus opportunities for 2011 

 

 

 

 

the 2011 bonuses for our executive officers were overwhelmingly based on whether the established financial performance objectives were met the compensation committee also considered in a purely subjective manner how well the executive officer performed his or her duties during the year information was solicited from relevant members of senior management regarding the performance of our named executive officers described following and determinations and recommendations were made at the regularly scheduled first quarter board and compensation committee meetings held in january 2012 other factors considered by the compensation committee primarily consisted of the amount of the bonus paid to the executive officer in the prior year and market data about compensation of comparable positions of responsibility at comparable companies consisting of the compensation surveys referred to above with respect to using these other factors in assessing performance the compensation committee did not find it practicable to and did not use a “score card” or quantify or assign relative weight to the specific criteria considered the amount of a downward adjustment subject to the maximum bonus opportunity that was established at the beginning of the year was not subject to a formula specific aspects of an individual’s performance were not identified in advance rather adjustments were based on the compensation committee’s judgment giving consideration to the totality of the record presented including the individual’s performance and the magnitude of any other positive or negative factors 

 

upon the occurrence of a change in control the compensation committee may take any action with respect to outstanding awards that it deems appropriate and in the event that such action is to distribute an award the award will be distributed in a lump sum no later than 30 days after the change in control under the plan “change in control” means i that any person other than a permitted holder as defined below becomes the beneficial owner of securities representing 50 or more of our voting power ii a sale merger or other business combination as a result of which transaction our voting securities outstanding immediately before such transaction do not continue to represent at least 50 of our voting power after giving effect to such transaction iii the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets other than to an entity of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by permitted holders as defined below iv during any period of two consecutive years following the closing of our initial public offering individuals who were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election by our stockholders was approved by a vote of twothirds of the directors then still in office who had been directors at the beginning of the period or previously so approved cease for any reason other than normal retirement death or disability to constitute at least a majority of the board of directors then in office or v our stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of us or an agreement for the sale or disposition by us of all or substantially all of our assets under the plan a “permitted holder” means richard d kinder and investment funds advised by or affiliated with goldman sachs  co highstar capital lp the carlyle group and riverstone holdings llc 

 

if in connection with a change in control richard d kinder is no longer our chairman 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

compensation related to the going private transaction 

 

in connection with our going private transaction members of management were awarded kinder morgan holdco llc class a1 and class b units in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we are required to recognize compensation expense in connection with the class a1 and class b units over the expected life of such units  however we do not have any obligation nor did we pay any amounts related to these compensation expenses all expenses were borne by the investors and since we were not responsible for paying these expenses we recognized the amounts allocated to us as both an expense on our income statement and a contribution to “stockholders equity” on our balance sheet the awards and terms of the class b units granted to members of management were determined after extensive negotiations between management and the sponsor investors with respect to which management agreed to forego any longterm executive compensation at least until the sponsor investors sell their interests in us 

 

comparison of class b units to class b shares   the class b units were converted into class b shares in connection with the initial public offering the class b shares are intended to substantially preserve the economic rights of the class b units in kinder morgan holdco llc but differ from the class b units in certain respects including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under our shareholders agreement “change of control” means i the acquisition by any person or group other than permitted holders as defined below by way of merger amalgamation consolidation or other business combination or purchase of beneficial ownership of more than 50 of our total voting power after giving effect to such transaction ii a sale merger or similar transaction or related series of transactions involving us as a result of which persons who 

 

  

  

 

collectively held 100 of our total voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not collectively hold more than 50 of our total voting power after giving effect to such transaction unless a the persons who collectively held 100 of our total voting power continue to hold at least 35 of our total voting power b no other person or group holds more than 35 of our total voting power and c either richard d kinder or park shaper is a senior executive officer or iii the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries’ taken as a whole other than to an entity of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by a permitted holder or by persons who held more than 50 of our total voting power immediately prior to such transaction under the shareholders agreement “permitted holders” means the investors and their successors and permitted transferees 

 

comparison of class a1 units to class c shares the class a1 units converted into the class c shares in connection with our initial public offering the class c shares are intended to substantially preserve the economic rights of the class a1 units in kinder morgan holdco llc but differ from the class a1 units in certain respects including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

class b share plan and class b share trust the class b shares may be forfeited by our management under the circumstances described above all forfeited class b shares will automatically become treasury shares and we will transfer the forfeited class b shares to a trust established solely to hold these class b shares together with any dividends proceeds received in respect of these class b shares shares of class p common stock issued in connection with the conversion of these class b shares or earnings with respect to such property we have established the class b share plan which is a longterm compensation plan to govern the terms of awards in respect of forfeited class b shares and related property in the class b share trust pursuant to the class b share plan and our shareholders agreement each item of property in the trust may be distributed separately from the underlying class b shares to members of new or existing management other than richard d kinder as designated by the chief executive officer and approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors nominated by the sponsor investors all property held in the trust on may 31 2015 will be distributed proportionally to the holders of class b shares as of may 31 2015 we have agreed to pay the costs of the class b share trust including the fees of the independent trustee but do not expect these costs to be material

upon termination of employment of a named executive officer due to death or disability as determined in accordance with our longterm disability plan covering such employee all of his or her class b shares will no longer be subject to forfeiture in the event of a termination of employment of a named executive officer by us without “cause” or by a named executive officer with “good reason” as each such term is defined in our shareholders agreement and described under “—other potential postemployment benefits—severance agreements” 50 of his or her class b shares will no longer be subject to forfeiture in addition all unvested class b shares will no longer be subject to forfeiture upon a change of control as defined in the shareholders agreement and described under “—compensation related to the going private transaction—comparison of class b units to class b shares” the following tables list separately the potential payments and benefits upon a change in control and the potential payments and benefits upon a termination of employment for our named executive officers the tables assume the triggering event for the payments or provision of benefits occurred on december 31 2011 actual amounts payable to each executive listed below upon termination can only be determined definitively at the time of each executive’s actual departure in addition to the amounts shown in the tables below each executive would receive payments for amounts of base salary and vacation time accrued through the date of termination and payment for any reimbursable business expenses incurred prior to the date of termination

other potential postemployment benefits 

 

employment agreement on october 7 1999 richard d kinder entered into an employment agreement with kmk pursuant to which he agreed to serve as its chairman and chief executive officer his employment agreement provides for a term of three years and one year extensions on each anniversary of october 7th mr kinder at his initiative accepted an annual salary of 1 to demonstrate his belief in kmk’s and kmp’s longterm viability mr kinder continues to accept an annual salary of 1 and he receives no other compensation from us 

 

we believe that mr kinder’s employment agreement contains provisions that are beneficial to us and accordingly mr kinder’s employment agreement is extended annually at the request of our and kmr’s boards of directors for example with limited exceptions mr kinder is prevented from competing in any manner with kmk or any of its subsidiaries while he is employed by kmk and for 12 months following the termination of his employment the employment agreement provides that he will receive a severance payment equal to 225 million in the event his employment is terminated without “cause” or in the event he is subject to a “change in duties” without his consent his employment agreement also provides that in the event of his death or termination due to his total and permanent disability he or his estate will receive an amount equal to the greater of his annual salary 1 or 750000 and in the case of his total and permanent disability such amount will be an annual amount until the effective date of termination of 

 

  

  

 

employment in addition under the terms of our shareholders agreement mr kinder also has agreed not to compete with us or any of our subsidiaries for an additional period of one year and not to solicit any of their employees or interfere with certain of their business relationships during the term of his employment and for two years thereafter 

 

upon a change in control and a termination of mr kinder’s employment by kmk or by mr kinder certain payments made to him could be subject to the excise tax imposed on “excess parachute payments” by the internal revenue code pursuant to his employment agreement mr kinder is entitled to have his compensation “grossed up” for all such excise taxes and any federal state and local taxes applicable to such grossup payment including any penalties and interest we estimate the amount of such gross up payment for mr kinder’s termination payment and benefits to be approximately 105 million the estimate of “excess parachute payments” for purposes of these calculations does not take into account any mitigation for payments which could be shown under the facts and circumstances not to be contingent on a change in control or for any payments being made in consideration of noncompetition agreements or as reasonable compensation the grossup calculations assume an excise tax rate of 20 a statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and a medicare tax rate of 145 if upon a change in control mr kinder’s employment does not terminate he would only be entitled to the immediate vesting of any class b shares 

 

under the employment agreement “cause” means i a grand jury indictment or prosecutorial information charging mr kinder with illegal or fraudulent acts criminal conduct or willful misconduct ii a grand jury indictment or prosecutorial information charging mr kinder with any criminal acts involving moral turpitude iii grossly negligent failure by mr kinder to perform his duties in a manner which he has reason to know is in kmk’s best interest iv bad faith refusal by mr kinder to carry out reasonable instructions of the board of directors of kmk and v a material violation by mr kinder of any of the terms of the employment agreement 

 

under the employment agreement “change in duties” means without mr kinder’s written consent any of the following i a significant reduction in the nature scope of authority or duties of mr kinder ii a substantial reduction in mr kinder’s existing annual base salary or bonus opportunity iii receipt of employee benefits by mr kinder that are materially inconsistent with the employee benefits provided by kmi to executives with comparable duties or iv a change of more than 50 miles in the location of mr kinder’s principal place of employment 

 

severance agreements  in connection with our initial public offering we entered into severance agreements with respect to eleven of our or our subsidiaries’ executive officers including our named executive officers other than richard d kinder that provide for severance in the amount of the executive’s salary plus benefits during the executive’s noncompete period ranging from one to two years following the executive’s termination of employment if the executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment for “good reason” or the executive’s employment with us and our subsidiaries is terminated “without cause” the other employees who did not enter into severance agreements with us are eligible for the same severance policy as all regular full time usbased employees not covered by a bargaining agreement which caps severance payments at an amount equal to six months of salary 

 

under the severance agreements “cause” means any of the following i conviction of a felony ii commission of fraud or embezzlement against us or any of our subsidiaries iii gross neglect of or gross or willful misconduct in connection with the performance of duties that is not cured within 30 days after written notice iv willful failure or refusal to carry out reasonable and lawful instructions of the chief executive officer or the board of directors that is not cured within 30 days after written notice v failure to perform duties and responsibilities as the individual’s primary business activity vi judicial determination that the individual breached fiduciary duties vii willful and material breach of the shareholders agreement certificate of incorporation or bylaws that is not cured within 30 days after written notice or viii material breach of a noncompete provision in the case of specified officers that is not cured with 30 days after written notice under the shareholders agreement “good reason” occurs when one of the following events occurs without an employee’s consent such employee provides written notice such event is not corrected after such notice and the employee resigns i material diminution in the employee’s duties and responsibilities ii material reduction in the employee’s annual base salary or aggregate benefits iii material reduction in the employee’s bonus opportunity iv relocation of the employee’s primary place of employment by more than 50 miles or v willful and intentional breach of the shareholders agreement by us that has a material and adverse effect on the employee 

 

  

  

 

summary compensation table 

 

the following table shows compensation paid or otherwise awarded to our i principal executive officer ii principal financial officer and iii three most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer and principal financial officer serving at fiscal yearend 2011 collectively referred to as the “named executive officers” for services rendered to our affiliated entities during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 the amounts in the columns below represent the total compensation paid or awarded to our named executive officers by all our affiliated entities 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

grants of planbased awards 

 

the following supplemental compensation table shows compensation details on the value of all nonguaranteed and nondiscretionary incentive awards granted during 2011 to our named executive officers the table includes awards made during or for 2011 the information in the table under the caption “estimated future payouts under nonequity incentive plan awards” represents the threshold target and maximum amounts payable under our annual incentive plan for performance in 2011 amounts actually paid under that plan for 2011 are set forth in the summary compensation table under the caption “nonequity incentive plan compensation” 

 

 

 

 

outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend 

 

option awards and stock awards 

 

none of our named executive officers has been awarded any stock options restricted stock or similar stockbased awards and we do not expect to grant any such awards to our named executive officers while the sponsor investors hold class a shares 

 

awards of participation interests in going private transaction 

 

the holders of class p common stock do not bear any of the economic cost of and are not diluted by the class b shares and the class b shares and the conversions of class b shares into class p shares do not impact the per share dividends paid on the class p shares or the aggregate dividends we pay to our shareholders in connection with the going private transaction members of management including our named executive officers were awarded class b units as participation interests the awards and terms of the class b units determined after extensive negotiations between management and the sponsor investors provided that the investors in the going private transaction would bear the economic burden of any value of the class b units in exchange for which management agreed to forego any longterm compensation at least until the sponsor investors sell their interests in us the class b units were converted into class b shares in connection with our initial public offering and the terms of the class b shares continued to provide that the investors in the going private transaction and thus not the public shareholders would bear the economic cost related to any class b share value the aggregate amount of our class p common stock into which the class a shares class b shares and class c shares can convert is fixed the conversion of class b shares into class p shares reduces the number of class p shares into which the class a shares and class c shares can convert therefore we view the class b shares along with the class a shares and class c shares as participation interests in the going private transaction rather than as awards of stockbased compensation 

 

the class b shares are not subject to time vesting but may be forfeited upon termination of employment in addition the number of class p shares into which the class b shares of a series will convert depends on the total value in excess of an agreed upon return threshold received by the holders of the corresponding series of class a shares when such class a shares are converted into class p shares as a result the remaining class b shares of a series may convert into zero class p shares if the return threshold is not met see “description of kinder morgan capital stock—classes of kinder morgan capital stock—voluntary conversion” 

 

the following table sets forth the number of class b shares held by each named executive officer as of december 31 2011 as noted above the holders of class p common stock do not bear any of the economic cost of and are not diluted by the class b shares and the class b shares and the conversions of class b shares into class p shares do not impact the per share dividends paid on the class p shares or the aggregate dividends we pay to our shareholders 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

stock vested 

 

as described above under “outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend” the class b shares are not subject to time vesting however viewing the conversion of class b shares into class p shares as “vesting” of stock awards the following table sets forth the number of class p shares acquired by our named executive officers upon the conversions of class b shares and the value realized upon such conversions and from dividends during 2011 the class p shares acquired and value realized set forth in the following table reduced both the number of class p shares and the amount of dividends that otherwise would have been received by the investors with respect to their class a shares these shares acquired and value realized in no way diluted or impacted the dividends received by our public shareholders 

 

 

 

  

  

 

risks associated with compensation practices 

 

we kmgp services company inc and kinder morgan canada inc employ all persons necessary for the operation of our business and in our opinion our compensation policies and practices for all persons necessary for the operation of our business do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows our belief is based on the fact that our employee compensation—primarily consisting of annual salaries and cash bonuses—is based on performance that does not reward risky behavior and is not tied to entering into transactions that pose undue risks to us 

 

stock compensation plan for nonemployee directors 

 

in connection with our initial public offering we have adopted the stock compensation plan for nonemployee directors in which our newlyappointed independent directors will participate none of the eleven directors nominated by richard d kinder or the sponsor investors will participate in the plan the following is a summary of the plan the plan is administered by our compensation committee and our board has sole discretion to terminate the plan at any time the primary purpose of this plan is to promote our interests and the interests of our stockholders by aligning the compensation of the nonemployee members of our board of directors with stockholders’ interests 

 

the plan recognizes that the compensation to be paid to each nonemployee director is fixed by our board generally annually and that the compensation is payable in cash pursuant to the plan in lieu of receiving some or all of the cash compensation each nonemployee director who was not nominated by richard d kinder or one of the sponsor investors referred to as “eligible directors” may elect to receive shares of class p common stock each election will be generally at or around the first board meeting in january of each calendar year and will be effective for the entire calendar year an eligible director may make a new election each calendar year the total number of shares of class p common stock authorized under the plan is 250000 

 

each annual election to receive shares of class p common stock will be evidenced by an agreement between us and each eligible director that will contain the terms and conditions of each award shares issued under the plan pursuant to an election may be subject to forfeiture restrictions that lapse on the earlier of the director’s death or the date set forth in the agreement which will be no later than the end of the calendar year to which the cash compensation relates until the forfeiture restrictions lapse shares issued under the plan may not be sold assigned transferred exchanged or pledged by an eligible director in the event a director’s service as a director is terminated prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions for any reason other than death or the director’s failure to be elected as a director at a shareholders meeting at which the director is considered for election the director will for no consideration forfeit to us all shares to the extent then subject to the forfeiture restrictions if prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions the director is not elected as a director at a shareholders meeting at which the director is considered for election the forfeiture restrictions will lapse with respect to fifty percent 50 of the director’s shares then subject to such restrictions and the director will for no consideration forfeit to us the remaining shares shares with respect to which forfeiture restrictions have lapsed will cease to be subject to any forfeiture restrictions and we will provide the eligible director a certificate representing the shares as to which the forfeiture restrictions have lapsed in addition each eligible director will have the right to receive dividends with respect to the shares awarded to him under the plan to be paid as described below to vote such shares and to enjoy all other class p common stockholder rights including during the period prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions 

 

the number of shares to be issued to an eligible director electing to receive any portion of the cash compensation in the form of shares will equal the amount of such cash compensation elected to be paid in the form of shares divided by the closing price of the class p common stock on the new york stock exchange on the day the cash compensation is awarded such price the fair market value rounded up to the nearest ten shares an eligible director electing to receive any portion of the cash compensation in the form of shares will receive cash equal to the difference between i the total cash compensation awarded to such director and ii the number of shares to be issued to such director multiplied by the fair market value of a share this cash payment will be payable in four equal installments generally around march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 of the calendar year in which such cash compensation is awarded provided that the installment payments will be adjusted to include dividends with respect to the shares during a period in which the shares are subject to forfeiture restrictions

the west coast terminals are feebased terminals located in the seattle portland san francisco and los angeles areas along the west coast of the united states combined these terminals have a total capacity of approximately 90 million barrels of storage for both petroleum products and chemicals kmp’s west coast products pipelines and associated west coast terminals together handled 168 million barrels of ethanol in 2010 a 46 increase when compared to the 115 million barrels handled in 2009 

 

markets combined the pacific operations and calnev pipeline system transport approximately 12 million barrels per day of refined petroleum products providing pipeline service to approximately 28 customerowned terminals 11 commercial airports and 15 military bases   the pipeline systems serve approximately 72 shippers in the refined petroleum products market the largest customers being major petroleum companies independent refiners and the united states military a substantial portion of the product volume transported is gasoline demand for gasoline and in turn the volumes transported depends on such factors as prevailing economic conditions government specifications and regulations vehicular use and purchase patterns and demographic changes in the markets served certain product volumes can also experience seasonal variations and consequently overall delivery volumes may be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 

 

supply the majority of refined products supplied to the west coast product pipelines come from the major refining centers around los angeles san francisco west texas and puget sound as well as from waterborne terminals and connecting pipelines located near these refining centers 

 

competition the two most significant competitors of the pacific and calnev operations are i proprietary pipelines owned and operated by oil companies in the area where kmp’s pipelines deliver products and ii refineries with terminals that have trucking arrangements within kmp’s market areas kmp believes that high capital costs tariff regulation and environmental and rightofway permitting considerations make it unlikely that a competing pipeline system comparable in size and scope to its west coast products pipelines will be built in the foreseeable future however the possibility of individual pipelines such as the hollysinclair unev pipeline from salt lake city utah to las vegas nevada being constructed or expanded to serve specific markets is a continuing competitive factor 

 

the use of trucks for product distribution from either shipperowned proprietary terminals or from their refining centers continues to compete for short haul movements by pipeline the west coast terminal operations compete with terminals owned by its shippers and by third party terminal operators in california arizona and nevada competitors include shell oil products us bp wilmington liquid bulk terminals vopak nustar pro petroleum and chevron kmp cannot predict with any certainty whether the use of short haul trucking will decrease or increase in the future 

 

plantation pipe line company 

 

kmp owns approximately 51 of plantation pipe line company the sole owner of the approximately 3100mile refined petroleum products plantation pipeline system serving the southeastern united states kmp operates the system pursuant to agreements with plantation and a related entity plantation services llc the plantation pipeline system serves as a common carrier of refined petroleum products to various metropolitan areas including birmingham alabama atlanta georgia charlotte north carolina and the washington dc area an affiliate of exxonmobil corporation owns the remaining approximately 49 ownership interest and exxonmobil has historically been one of the largest shippers on the plantation system both in terms of volumes and revenues 

 

  

  

 

 

in 2010 plantation delivered approximately 498300 barrels per day of refined petroleum products with the product mix being approximately 65 gasoline 22 diesel fuel and 13 jet fuel in 2009 plantation delivered approximately 487000 barrels per day of refined petroleum products 

 

markets plantation ships products for approximately 30 companies to terminals throughout the southeastern united states plantation’s principal customers are gulf coast refining and marketing companies fuel wholesalers and the united states department of defense during 2010 plantation’s top eight shippers represented approximately 97 of total system volumes 

 

the eight states in which plantation operates represent a collective pipeline demand of approximately two million barrels per day of refined petroleum products plantation currently has direct access to about 15 million barrels per day of this overall market the remaining 05 million barrels per day of demand lies in markets eg nashville tennessee north augusta south carolina bainbridge georgia and selma north carolina currently served by another pipeline company plantation also delivers jet fuel to the atlanta georgia charlotte north carolina and washington dc airports ronald reagan national and dulles and military jet fuel to military facilities in the southeast 

 

supply products shipped on plantation originate at various gulf coast refineries from which major integrated oil companies and independent refineries and wholesalers ship refined petroleum products plantation is directly connected to and supplied by a total of ten major refineries representing approximately 25 million barrels per day of refining capacity 

 

competition plantation competes primarily with the colonial pipeline system which also runs from gulf coast refineries throughout the southeastern united states and extends into both the midatlantic and northeastern united states 

 

central florida pipeline 

 

kmp’s central florida pipeline operations consist of i a 110mile 16inch diameter pipeline that transports gasoline and ethanol ii an 85mile 10inch diameter pipeline that transports diesel fuel and jet fuel from tampa to orlando and iii two separate liquids terminals located in tampa and taft florida which kmp owns and operates 

 

both pipelines service kmp’s taft terminal located near orlando and the 10inch diameter pipeline has an additional intermediate delivery point at intercession city florida and is also the sole pipeline supplying jet fuel to the orlando international airport in orlando florida in 2010 the pipeline system transported approximately 104800 barrels per day of refined products with the product mix being approximately 69 gasoline and ethanol 11 diesel fuel and 20 jet fuel in 2009 the central florida pipeline system delivered approximately 107100 barrels per day of refined petroleum products in addition to being connected to the tampa terminal kmp’s central florida pipeline system is connected to terminals owned and operated by transmontaigne citgo bp and marathon petroleum 

 

kmp’s tampa terminal contains approximately 15 million barrels of storage capacity and is connected to two ship dock facilities in the port of tampa the terminal provides storage for gasoline ethanol diesel fuel and jet fuel for further movement into either trucks or into the central florida pipeline system and also provides storage and truck rack blending services for biodiesel kmp’s taft terminal contains approximately 07 million barrels of storage capacity for gasoline ethanol and diesel fuel for further movement into trucks 

 

markets the total refined petroleum products demand for the central florida region of the state which includes the tampa and orlando markets is estimated to be approximately 356000 barrels per day or 45 of the consumption of refined products in the state and gasoline is by far the largest component of that demand kmp distributes approximately 150000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day including the tampa terminal truck loadings the balance of the market is supplied primarily by trucking firms and marine transportation firms the market in central florida is seasonal and heavily influenced by tourism with demand peaks in march and april during spring break and again in the summer vacation season 

 

supply the vast majority of refined petroleum products consumed in florida are supplied via marine vessels from major refining centers in the gulf coast of louisiana and mississippi and refineries in the caribbean basin a lesser amount of refined petroleum products is supplied by refineries in alabama and by texas gulf coast refineries via marine vessels and through pipeline networks that extend to bainbridge georgia the supply into florida is generally transported by oceangoing vessels to the larger metropolitan ports such as tampa port everglades near miami and jacksonville individual markets are then supplied from terminals at these ports and other smaller ports predominately by trucks except the central florida region which is served by a combination of trucks and pipelines 

 

  

  

 

 

competition with respect to the central florida pipeline system the most significant competitors are trucking firms and marine transportation firms trucking transportation is more competitive in serving markets close to the marine terminals on the east and west coasts of florida kmp utilizes tariff incentives to attract volumes to the pipeline that might otherwise enter the orlando market area by truck from tampa or by marine vessel into cape canaveral kmp believes it is unlikely that a new pipeline system comparable in size and scope to its central florida pipeline system will be constructed due to the high cost of pipeline construction tariff regulation and environmental and rightofway permitting in florida however the possibility of such a pipeline or a smaller capacity pipeline being built is a continuing competitive factor 

 

with respect to kmp’s terminal operations at tampa the most significant competitors are proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies such as the citgo terminals located along the port of tampa the chevron and motiva terminals located in port tampa and terminals owned by marathon petroleum and bp these competing terminals generally support the storage requirements of their parent or affiliated companies’ refining and marketing operations and provide a mechanism for an oil company to enter into exchange contracts with third parties to serve its storage needs in markets where the oil company may not have terminal assets 

 

cochin pipeline system 

 

kmp’s cochin pipeline system consists of an approximately 1900mile 12inch diameter multiproduct pipeline operating between fort saskatchewan alberta and windsor ontario along with five terminals the pipeline operates on a batched basis and has an estimated system capacity of approximately 70000 barrels per day it includes 31 pump stations spaced at 60 mile intervals and five united states propane terminals underground storage is available at fort saskatchewan alberta and windsor ontario through third parties in 2010 and 2009 the pipeline system transported approximately 20000 and 29300 barrels per day of natural gas liquids respectively further information about the cochin system is discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—products pipelines—kmp” 

 

markets the pipeline traverses three provinces in canada and seven states in the united states and can transport propane butane and natural gas liquids to the midwestern united states and eastern canadian petrochemical and fuel markets current operations involve only the transportation of propane on cochin 

 

supply injection into the system can occur from bp provident keyera or dow facilities with connections at fort saskatchewan alberta and from spectra at interconnects at regina and richardson saskatchewan 

 

competition the pipeline competes with railcars and enbridge energy partners for natural gas liquids longhaul business from fort saskatchewan alberta and windsor ontario the pipeline’s primary competition in the chicago natural gas liquids market comes from the combination of the alliance pipeline system which brings unprocessed gas into the united states from canada and aux sable which processes and markets the natural gas liquids in the chicago market 

 

cypress pipeline 

 

kmp now owns 50 of cypress interstate pipeline llc the sole owner of the cypress pipeline system the cypress pipeline is an interstate common carrier natural gas liquids pipeline originating at storage facilities in mont belvieu texas and extending 104 miles east to a connection with westlake chemical corporation a major petrochemical producer in the lake charles louisiana area effective october 1 2010 westlake petrochemicals llc a whollyowned subsidiary of westlake chemical corporation exercised its option to purchase from kmp a 50 ownership interest in cypress interstate pipeline llc however kmp remains the operator of the cypress pipeline system

markets texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country the natural gas demand profile in kmp’s texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial including onsite cogeneration facilities merchant and utility power and local natural gas distribution consumption the industrial demand is primarily yearround load merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months as new merchant gas fired generation has come online and displaced traditional utility generation kmp has successfully attached many of these new generation facilities to its natural gas pipeline systems in order to maintain and grow its share of natural gas supply for power generation 

 

kmp serves the mexico market through interconnection with the facilities of pemex at the united statesmexico border near arguellas mexico and its miermonterrey mexico pipeline in 2010 deliveries through the existing interconnection near arguellas fluctuated from zero to approximately 276 million cubic feet per day of natural gas deliveries to monterrey also ranged from zero to 338 million cubic feet per day kmp primarily provides transport service to these markets on a fee for service basis including a significant demand component which is paid regardless of actual throughput revenues earned from activities in mexico are paid in us dollar equivalent 

 

supply kmp purchases natural gas directly from producers attached to its system in south texas east texas west texas and along the texas gulf coast in addition kmp also purchases gas at interconnects with thirdparty interstate and intrastate pipelines while the intrastate group does not produce gas it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure supplies for additional demand in its market area the intrastate system has access to both onshore and offshore sources of supply and liquefied natural gas from the freeport lng terminal near freeport texas and from the golden pass lng terminal located near sabine pass 

 

  

  

 

 

texas 

 

competition the texas intrastate natural gas market is highly competitive with many markets connected to multiple pipeline companies kmp competes with interstate and intrastate pipelines and their shippers for attachments to new markets and supplies and for transportation processing and treating services 

 

kinder morgan treating lp 

 

kmp believes it has the largest contracted natural gas treating fleet operation in the united states kmp’s subsidiary kinder morgan treating lp owns and operates or leases to producers for operation treating plants that remove impurities carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas before it is delivered into gathering systems and transmission pipelines to ensure that it meets pipeline quality specifications its primary treating assets include approximately 212 natural gas aminetreating plants and approximately 56 dew point control plants in addition effective september 1 2010 it acquired the natural gas treating assets of gaschill inc as discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—natural gas pipelines—kmp” 

 

the amine treating process involves a continuous circulation of a liquid chemical called amine that physically contacts with the natural gas amine has a chemical affinity for hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide that allows it to remove these impurities from the gas after mixing gas and reacted amine are separated and the impurities are removed from the amine by heating treating plants are sized by the amine circulation capacity in terms of gallons per minute 

 

dew point control is complementary to kmp’s treating business as pipeline companies enforce gas quality specifications to lower the hydrocarbon dew point of the gas they receive and transport a higher relative dew point can sometimes cause liquid hydrocarbons to condense in the pipeline and cause operating problems and gas quality issues to the downstream markets hydrocarbon dew point plants which consist of skid mounted processing equipment remove these hydrocarbons these plants lower the temperature of the gas stream and collect the liquids before they enter the downstream pipeline as of december 31 2010 kmp had approximately 268 treating and hydrocarbon dew point control plants in operation kmp typically charges a fixed monthly rental fee plus in those instances where it operates the equipment a fixed monthly operating fee 

 

supply natural gas from certain formations is high in carbon dioxide which generally needs to be removed before introduction of the gas into transportation pipelines many of kmp’s active plants are treating natural gas from the wilcox and edwards gas formations in the texas gulf coast and the haynesville shale gas formation in north louisiana and east texas all of which are deep formations that are high in carbon dioxide 

 

  markets shale reservoirs being developed today have concentrations of carbon dioxide above the normal pipeline quality specifications of 20 the eagle ford shale gas formation in south texas and the bossier shale gas formation in north louisiana and east texas are experiencing robust development and kmp believes that its treating business strategy is well suited to the producers in these areas 

 

competition kmp’s natural gas treating operations face competition from manufacturers of new treating and hydrocarbon dew point control plants and from a number of regional operators that provide plants and similar operations kmp also faces competition from vendors of used equipment that occasionally operate plants for producers in addition kmp may lose business to natural gas gatherers who have underutilized treating or processing capacity kmp may also lose wellhead treating opportunities to blending which is a pipeline company’s ability to waive quality specifications and allow producers to deliver their contaminated natural gas untreated this is generally referred to as blending because of the receiving company’s ability to blend this natural gas with cleaner natural gas in the pipeline such that the resulting natural gas meets pipeline specification 

 

kinderhawk field services llc 

 

in may 2010 kmp’s subsidiary km gathering llc purchased a 50 ownership interest in kinderhawk field services llc which gathers and treats natural gas in the haynesville shale gas formation located in northwest louisiana a subsidiary of petrohawk energy corporation owns the remaining 50 ownership interest 

 

kinderhawk’s assets consist of more than 365 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline currently in service with projected average throughput of approximately one billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2011 ultimately kinderhawk is expected to have approximately two billion cubic feet per day of throughput capacity which will make it one of the largest natural gas gathering and treating systems in the united states additionally the system’s natural gas amine treating plants have a current capacity of approximately 2160 gallons per minute 

 

  

  

 

 

kinderhawk received a dedication to gather and treat all of petrohawk’s operated haynesville and bossier shale gas production in northwest louisiana for the life of the leases at agreed upon rates as well as minimum volume commitments from petrohawk for the first five years of the joint venture agreement since kmp’s acquisition kinderhawk also secured additional new thirdparty gas gathering and treating commitments these contracts provide for the dedication of 17 sections from three shippers for three to tenyear terms the anticipated daily volume from thirdparties could approach over 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas depending on expected drill schedules and operational techniques

transcolorado gas transmission company llc 

 

kmp’s subsidiary transcolorado gas transmission company llc referred to in this report as transcolorado owns a 300mile interstate natural gas pipeline that extends from approximately 20 miles southwest of meeker colorado to the blanco hub near bloomfield new mexico it has multiple points of interconnection with various interstate and intrastate pipelines gathering systems and local distribution companies the transcolorado pipeline system is powered by eight compressor stations having an aggregate of approximately 39000 horsepower 

 

  

  

 

 

the transcolorado system has the ability to flow gas south or north it receives gas from a single coal seam natural gas treating plant located in the san juan basin of colorado and from pipeline processing plant and gathering system interconnections within the paradox and piceance basins of western colorado natural gas transmitted south through the pipeline system flows into the el paso transwestern and questar southern trail pipeline systems natural gas transmitted north through the system flows into the colorado interstate wyoming interstate and questar pipeline systems at the greasewood hub and into the rockies express pipeline system at the meeker hub transcolorado provides transportation services to thirdparty natural gas producers marketers gathering companies local distribution companies and other shippers 

 

pursuant to transportation agreements and ferc tariff provisions transcolorado offers its customers firm and interruptible transportation and interruptible park and loan services the underlying reservation and commodity charges are assessed pursuant to a maximum recourse rate structure which does not vary based on the distance gas is transported transcolorado has the authority to negotiate rates with customers if it has first offered service to those customers under its reservation and commodity charge rate structure 

 

markets the transcolorado system acts principally as a feeder pipeline system from the developing natural gas supply basins on the western slope of colorado into the interstate natural gas pipelines that lead away from the blanco hub area of new mexico and the interstate natural gas pipelines that lead away eastward from northwestern colorado and southwestern wyoming transcolorado is one of the largest transporters of natural gas from the western slope supply basins of colorado and provides a competitively attractive outlet for that developing natural gas resource in 2010 and 2009 transcolorado transported an average of approximately 472 million and 617 million cubic feet per day respectively of natural gas from these supply basins 

 

supply during 2010 95 of transcolorado’s transport business was with processors or producers or their own marketing affiliates and 5 was with marketing companies and various gas marketers approximately 65 of transcolorado’s transport business in 2010 was conducted with its three largest customers nearly all of transcolorado’s longhaul southbound pipeline capacity is committed under firm transportation contracts that extend at least through yearend 2011 as of december 31 2010 approximately 2 by volume of transcolorado’s firm transportation contracts expire within one year and 64 expire between one and five years however transcolorado is actively pursuing contract extensions andor replacement contracts to increase firm subscription levels beyond 2011 

 

competition the transcolorado system competes with other transporters of natural gas in each of the natural gas supply basins it serves these competitors include both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and natural gas gathering systems transcolorado’s shippers compete for market share with shippers drawing upon gas production facilities within the new mexico portion of the san juan basin transcolorado has phased its past construction and expansion efforts to coincide with the ability of the interstate pipeline grid at blanco new mexico and at the north end of its system to accommodate greater natural gas volumes historically the competition faced by transcolorado with respect to its natural gas transportation services has generally been based upon the price differential between the san juan and rocky mountain basins new pipelines servicing these producing basins and a reduction of rigs drilling in this area for gas have had the effect of reducing that price differential

co 2 —kmp 

 

the co 2 —kmp business segment consists of kinder morgan co 2 company lp and its consolidated affiliates referred to as kmco 2 in this report carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for 

 

  

  

 

 

recovering crude oil from mature oil fields the carbon dioxide pipelines and related assets allow kmp to market a complete package of carbon dioxide supply transportation and technical expertise to the customer the co 2 —kmp business segment produces transports and markets carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery operations kmco 2 also holds ownership interests in several oilproducing fields and owns a crude oil pipeline all located in the permian basin region of west texas 

 

oil producing activities 

 

kmco 2 holds ownership interests in oilproducing fields including i an approximate 97 working interest in the sacroc unit ii an approximate 50 working interest in the yates unit iii an approximate 21 net profits interest in the ht boyd unit iv an approximate 65 working interest in the claytonville unit v an approximate 99 working interest in the katz strawn unit and vi lesser interests in the sharon ridge unit the reinecke unit and the midcross unit all of which are located in the permian basin of west texas 

 

the sacroc unit is one of the largest and oldest oil fields in the united states using carbon dioxide flooding technology the field is comprised of approximately 56000 acres located in the permian basin in scurry county texas sacroc was discovered in 1948 and has produced over 133 billion barrels of oil since discovery it is estimated that sacroc originally held approximately 27 billion barrels of oil kmp has expanded the development of the carbon dioxide project initiated by the previous owners and increased production and ultimate oil recovery over the last several years the yates unit is also one of the largest oil fields ever discovered in the united states it is estimated that it originally held more than five billion barrels of oil of which about 29 has been produced the field discovered in 1926 is comprised of approximately 26000 acres located about 90 miles south of midland texas 

 

in 2010 the average purchased carbon dioxide injection rate at sacroc was 220 million cubic feet per day down from an average of 253 million cubic feet per day in 2009 the average oil production rate for 2010 was approximately 29200 barrels of oil per day down from an average of approximately 30100 barrels of oil per day during 2009 

 

kmp’s plan over the last several years has been to maintain overall production levels and increase ultimate recovery from yates by combining horizontal drilling with carbon dioxide injection to ensure a relatively steady production profile over the next several years kmp is implementing its plan and during 2010 the yates unit produced approximately 24000 barrels of oil per day down from an average of approximately 26500 barrels of oil per day during 2009 unlike kmp’s operations at sacroc where it uses carbon dioxide and water to drive oil to the producing wells kmp uses carbon dioxide at yates in order to enhance the gravity drainage process as well as to maintain reservoir pressure the differences in geology and reservoir mechanics between the two fields mean that substantially less capital will be needed to develop and produce the reserves at yates than is required at sacroc 

 

kmp also operates and owns an approximate 65 gross working interest in the claytonville oil field unit located in fisher county texas the claytonville unit is located nearly 30 miles east of the sacroc unit in the permian basin of west texas and the unit produced 203 barrels of oil per day during 2010 down from an average of 218 barrels of oil per day during 2009 kmp is presently evaluating operating and subsurface technical data from the claytonville unit to further assess redevelopment opportunities including carbon dioxide flood operations 

 

kmp also operates and owns working interests in the katz strawn unit the katz strawn unit is located in the permian basin area of west texas and during 2010 the unit produced 284 barrels of oil per day down from an average of 380 barrels of oil per day during 2009 the decline was primarily due to transition operations associated with converting from water injection to carbon dioxide injection in july 2009 kmp announced major investment plans to further expand its operations in the eastern permian basin area of texas and further information on this investment is discussed above in “—a general development of business—recent developments—co 2 —kmp”

the express pipeline is a 780mile 24inch diameter pipeline that begins at the crude oil pipeline hub at hardisty alberta and terminates at the casper wyoming facilities of the platte pipeline the express pipeline has a design capacity of 280000 barrels per day receipts at hardisty averaged 200000 barrels per day in 2010 as compared to 208246 barrels per day in 2009 

 

the platte pipeline is a 926mile 20inch diameter pipeline that runs from the crude oil pipeline hub at casper wyoming to refineries and interconnecting pipelines in the wood river illinois area the platte pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 150000 barrels per day downstream of casper wyoming and approximately 140000 barrels per day downstream of guernsey wyoming platte deliveries averaged 142400 barrels per day during 2010 as compared to 137810 barrels per day during 2009 

 

kmp also owns and operates the approximate 25mile aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver international airport located in vancouver british columbia canada the turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the jet fuel pipeline system in addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the westridge marine terminal located in port metro vancouver the jet fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15000 barrels 

 

competition  trans mountain and the express pipeline system are each one of several pipeline alternatives for western canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production and each competes against other pipeline providers 

 

ngpl pipeco llc 

 

in february 2008 we completed the sale of an 80 ownership interest in ngpl pipeco llc for approximately 59 billion we account for our 20 ownership interest as an equity method investment we continue to operate ngpl pipeco llc’s assets pursuant to a 15year operating agreement ngpl pipeco llc owns and operates approximately 9200 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines storage fields field system lines and related facilities consisting primarily of two major interconnected natural gas transmission pipelines terminating in the chicago illinois metropolitan area ngpl’s amarillo line originates in the west texas and new mexico producing areas and is comprised of approximately 4400 miles of mainline and various smalldiameter pipelines its other major pipeline the gulf coast line originates in the gulf coast areas of texas and louisiana and consists of approximately 4100 miles of mainline and various smalldiameter pipelines these two main pipelines are connected at points in texas and oklahoma by ngpl’s approximately 800mile amarillogulf coast pipeline 

 

ngpl is one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage operators with approximately 600 billion cubic feet of total natural gas storage capacity approximately 278 billion cubic feet of working gas capacity and over 43 billion cubic feet per day of peak deliverability from its storage facilities which are located in major supply areas and near the markets it serves ngpl owns and operates 13 underground storage reservoirs in eight field locations in four states these storage assets complement its pipeline facilities and allow it to optimize pipeline deliveries and meet peak delivery requirements in its principal markets 

 

competition   ngpl competes with other transporters of natural gas in virtually all of the markets it serves and in particular in the chicago area which is the northern terminus of ngpl’s two major pipeline segments and its largest market these competitors include both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and historically most of the competition has been from such pipelines with supplies originating in the united states ngpl also faces competition from alliance pipeline which began service during the 20002001 heating season carrying canadianproduced natural 

 

  

  

 

 

gas into the chicago market however at the same time the vector pipeline was constructed for the specific purpose of transporting gas from the chicago area to other markets generally further north and further east the overall impact of the increased pipeline capacity into the chicago area combined with additional takeaway capacity and the increased demand in the area has created a situation that remains dynamic with respect to the ultimate impact on individual transporters such as ngpl from time to time other pipelines are proposed which would compete with ngpl we cannot predict whether or when any such pipeline might be built or its impact on ngpl’s operations or profitability 

 

major customers 

 

our total revenues are derived from a wide customer base   for each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues kmp’s texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of texas and to a far lesser extent the co 2 —kmp business segment also sells natural gas combined total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the natural gas pipelines—kmp and co 2 —kmp and ngpl through february 14 2008 business segments in 2010 2009 and 2008 accounted for 441 448 and 637 respectively of our total consolidated revenues to the extent possible kmp attempts to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales we do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

regulation 

 

interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation – us operations 

 

some of our us refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the ferc those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services the ica requires among other things that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates if upon completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation the ferc also may investigate upon complaint or on its own motion rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively upon an appropriate showing a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

 

on october 24 1992 congress passed the energy policy act of 1992 the energy policy act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint protest or investigation during the 365day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ica the energy policy act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates certain rates on kmp’s pacific operations pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365day period established by the energy policy act accordingly certain of the pacific pipelines’ rates have been and continue to be the subject of complaints with the ferc as is more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year a pipeline must as a general rule utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates costofservice ratemaking marketbased rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates 

 

common carrier pipeline rate regulation – canadian operations 

 

the canadian portion of kmp’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of canada’s national energy board referred to in this report as neb the national energy board act gives the neb power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service 

 

  

  

 

 

trans mountain pipeline kmp’s subsidiary trans mountain pipeline lp previously had a toll settlement with shippers that defined tolls from 2006 to 2010 the settlement expired on december 31 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2010 trans mountain pipeline completed negotiations with the canadian association of petroleum producers for a new negotiated toll settlement for kmp’s trans mountain pipeline to be effective for the period starting january 1 2011 and ending december 31 2015 trans mountain filed the settlement with the neb in november 2010 and anticipates approval from the neb in the first half of 2011 the toll charged for the portion of trans mountain’s pipeline system located in the united states falls under the jurisdiction of the ferc see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation – us operations” 

 

express pipeline the canadian segment of the express pipeline is regulated by the neb as a group 2 pipeline which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only express committed contract rates are subject to a 2 inflation adjustment april 1 of each year the us segment of the express pipeline and the platte pipeline are regulated by the ferc see “—interstate common carrier refined petroleum products and oil pipeline rate regulation – us operations” additionally movements on the platte pipeline within the state of wyoming are regulated by the wyoming public service commission which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that operate in the state of wyoming the wyoming public service commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the ferc and the neb 

 

interstate natural gas transportation and storage regulation 

 

posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines within that range each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariffbased maximum and minimum rate levels accordingly there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay for example some shippers may pay a negotiated rate that is different than the posted tariff rate and some may pay the posted maximum tariff rate or a discounted rate that is limited by the posted maximum and minimum tariff rates most of the rates kmp charges shippers on its greenfield projects like the rockies express or midcontinent express pipelines are pursuant to negotiated rate longterm transportation agreements as such negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable 

 

the ferc regulates the rates terms and conditions of service construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services including storage services under the natural gas act of 1938 to a lesser extent the ferc regulates interstate transportation rates terms and conditions of service under the natural gas policy act of 1978 

 

on november 25 2003 the ferc issued order no 2004 adopting revised standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities in light of the changing structure of the energy industry these standards of conduct governed relationships between regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and all of their energy affiliates these standards were designed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on october 16 2008 the ferc issued a final rule in order no 717 which revised the ferc standards of conduct for natural gas and electric transmission providers by eliminating order no 2004’s concept of energy affiliates and corporate separation in favor of an employee functional approach according to the provisions of order no 717 a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee nonpublic information about the transmission system or a transmission customer the final rule also retains the longstanding noconduit rule which prohibits a transmission function provider from disclosing nonpublic information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit additionally the final rule requires that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees marketing function employees officers directors supervisory employees and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information 

 

  

  

 

 

this rule became effective november 26 2008 

 

on october 15 2009 the ferc issued order no 717a an order on rehearing and clarification regarding ferc’s affiliate rule—standards of conduct and on november 16 2009 the ferc issued order no 717b an order clarifying what employees should be considered marketing function employees in both orders the ferc clarified a lengthy list of issues relating to the applicability the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees the definition of transmission function information independent functioning transparency training and north american energy standards board business practice standards the ferc generally reaffirmed its determinations in order no 717 but granted rehearing on and clarified provisions order nos 717a and 717b aim to make the standards of conduct clearer and aim to refocus the rules on the areas where there is the greatest potential for abuse the rehearing and clarification granted in order no 717a are not anticipated to have a material impact on the operation of our interstate pipelines 

 

in addition to regulatory changes initiated by the ferc the us congress passed the energy policy act of 2005 among other things the energy policy act amended the natural gas act to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act the natural gas policy act of 1978 or ferc rules regulations or orders thereunder 

 

california public utilities commission rate regulation 

 

the intrastate common carrier operations of kmp’s pacific operations pipelines in california are subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission referred to in this report as cpuc under a “depreciated book plant” methodology which is based on an original cost measure of investment intrastate tariffs filed by kmp with the cpuc have been established on the basis of revenues expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the california intrastate portion of the pacific operations’ business tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in california are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the cpuc a variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the cpuc and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to kmp’s ferc regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates certain of the pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been and continue to be subject to complaints with the cpuc as is more fully described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

texas railroad commission rate regulation 

 

the intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the texas railroad commission the texas railroad commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 

 

safety regulation 

 

our interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation referred to in this report as the us dot and our intrastate pipelines and other operations are subject to comparable state regulations with respect to their design installation testing construction operation replacement and management comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct pipeline operations in addition our truck and terminal loading facilities are subject to us dot regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicles and railcars 

 

on september 15 2010 the secretary of the us dot sent to the us congress proposed legislation to provide stronger oversight of the nation’s pipelines and to increase the penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules the proposed legislation entitled “strengthening pipeline safety and enforcement act of 2010” would among other things increase the maximum fine for the most serious violations from 1 million to 25 million provide additional resources for the enforcement program require a review of whether safety requirements for “high consequence areas” should be applied instead to entire pipelines eliminate exemptions and ensure standards are in place for biofuel and carbon dioxide pipelines 

 

the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 provides guidelines in the areas of testing education training and communication the pipeline safety improvement act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as “high consequence areas” testing consists of hydrostatic testing internal magnetic flux or ultrasonic testing or direct assessment of the piping in 

 

  

  

 

 

addition to the pipeline integrity tests pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained a similar integrity management rule exists for refined petroleum products pipelines 

 

we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act and other comparable federal and state statutes that address employee health and safety 

 

in general we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards such increases in our expenditures and the extent to which they might be offset cannot be accurately estimated at this time 

 

state and local regulation 

 

our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations as well as orders of regulatory bodies governing a wide variety of matters including marketing production pricing pollution protection of the environment and human health and safety 

 

environmental matters 

 

our business operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection pollution and human health and safety in the united states and canada for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or at or from our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damages compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures furthermore new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws including the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition emission controls required under federal state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

 

environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment wildlife natural resources and human health there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed we have accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where the us environmental protection agency referred to in this report as the us epa or similar state or canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures we believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position or results of operations however it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business financial position results of operations our dividends to shareholders or kmp’s distributions to its limited partners in any particular reporting period we have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of 798 million as of december 31 2010 our reserve estimates range in value from approximately 798 million to approximately 1278 million and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability for additional information related to environmental matters see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

hazardous and nonhazardous waste 

 

we generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and canadian statutes from time to time the us epa and state and canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous waste furthermore it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as nonhazardous which could include wastes currently generated 

 

  

  

 

 

during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us 

 

superfund 

 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as “cercla” or the “superfund” law and analogous state and canadian laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of “potentially responsible persons” for releases of “hazardous substances” into the environment these persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site cercla authorizes the us epa and in some cases third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any although “petroleum” is excluded from cercla’s definition of a “hazardous substance” in the course of our ordinary operations we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance” by operation of law if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present in addition to compensation for natural resource damages if any 

 

clean air act 

 

our operations are subject to the clean air act its implementing regulations and analogous state and canadian statutes and regulations we believe that the operations of our pipelines storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes the us epa has recently adopted new regulations under the clean air act that are to take effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources the clean air act regulations contain lengthy complex provisions that may result in the imposition over the next several years of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our pipelines treating and processing facilities storage facilities terminals and wells depending on the nature of those requirements and any additional requirements that may be imposed by state local and canadian regulatory authorities we may be required to incur capital and operating expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals and addressing other air emissionrelated issues at this time we are unable to fully estimate the effect on earnings or operations or the amount and timing of such required capital expenditures however we do not believe that we will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements 

 

clean water act 

 

our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state and canadian laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal state or canadian authorities the oil pollution act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the clean water act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the clean water act and some state and canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release 

 

climate change 

 

studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases the us congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases on june 26 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of 2009 referred to in this report as acesa which would establish an economywide capandtrade program to reduce us emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane the us senate has been working on its own legislation for restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions and president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system it is not possible at this time to predict when the senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the senate would be reconciled with acesa 

 

  

  

 

 

the us epa announced on december 7 2009 its finding that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment this finding by the us epa allowed the agency to adopt regulations that began restricting emissions of greenhouse gases from certain stationary sources using existing provisions of the federal clean air act on january 2 2011 additionally the us epa has issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states beginning in 2011 for emissions that occurred in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources fractionated natural gas liquids and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide like kmp’s mcelmo dome carbon dioxide field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere 

 

because kmp’s operations including the compressor stations and gas processing plants in the natural gas pipelines—kmp business segment emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and carbon dioxide such legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities and require us to install new emission controls on the facilities acquire allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program kmp is not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however they could be significant while kmp may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its natural gas pipelines such recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond its control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

 

because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels energy legislation or us epa regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil in addition we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the co 2 —kmp business segment however these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing nonfossil fuels although the magnitude and direction of these impacts cannot now be predicted greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

 

some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather to the extent these phenomena occur they could damage our physical assets especially operations located in lowlying areas near coasts and river banks and facilities situated in hurricaneprone regions however the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and in any event these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon thus we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business financial position results of operations or prospects 

 

department of homeland security 

 

in section 550 of the homeland security appropriations act of 2007 the us congress gave the department of homeland security referred to in this report as the dhs regulatory authority over security at certain highrisk chemical facilities pursuant to its congressional mandate on april 9 2007 the dhs promulgated the chemical facility antiterrorism standards and required all highrisk chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards this process includes completing security vulnerability assessments developing site security plans and implementing protective measures necessary to meet dhsdefined riskbased performance standards the dhs has not provided final notice to all facilities that dhs determines to be high risk and subject to the rule therefore neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined but it is possible that such costs could be substantial 

 

other 

 

employees 

 

we employed 8142 fulltime people at december 31 2010 including employees of our indirect subsidiary kmgp services company inc who are dedicated to the operations of kmp and employees of kinder morgan canada inc approximately 925 fulltime hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2011 and 2015 we kmgp services company inc and kinder morgan canada inc each consider relations with our employees to be good for more information on our related party transactions see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

  

  

 

 

kmgp services company inc a subsidiary of kinder morgan gp inc provides employees and kinder morgan services llc a subsidiary of kmr provides centralized payroll and employee benefits services to kmr kmp and kmp’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries collectively “the group” employees of kmgp services company inc are assigned to work for one or more members of the group the direct costs of compensation benefits expenses employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated and charged by kinder morgan services llc to the appropriate members of the group and the members of the group reimburse their allocated shares of these direct costs no profit or margin is charged by kinder morgan services llc to the members of the group our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services and the related administrative costs are allocated to members of the group in accordance with existing expense allocation procedures the effect of these arrangements is that each member of the group bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees as the case may be while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs pursuant to its limited partnership agreement kmp provides reimbursement for its share of these administrative costs and such reimbursements are accounted for as described above kmp reimburses kmr with respect to the costs incurred or allocated to kmr in accordance with kmp’s limited partnership agreement the delegation of control agreement among kinder morgan gp inc kmr kmp and others and kmr’s limited liability company agreement 

 

our named executive officers and other employees that provide management or services to us and the group are employed by us additionally other of our employees assist kmp in the operation of its natural gas pipeline assets these employees’ expenses are allocated without a profit component between us and the appropriate members of the group 

 

properties 

 

we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to the properties we own and use in our businesses subject to liens for current taxes liens incident to minor encumbrances and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property the interests in those properties or the use of such properties in our businesses our terminals storage facilities treating and processing plants regulator and compressor stations oil and gas wells offices and related facilities are located on real property owned or leased by us in some cases the real property we lease is on federal state provincial or local government land 

 

we generally do not own the land on which our pipelines are constructed instead we obtain the right to construct and operate the pipelines on other people’s land for a period of time substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rightsofway granted by the apparent record owners of such property in many instances lands over which rightsofway have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the rightofway grants in some cases not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the rightofway grants but in substantially all such cases signatures of the owners of a majority of the interests have been obtained permits have been obtained from public authorities to cross over or under or to lay facilities in or along water courses county roads municipal streets and state highways and in some instances such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor or the pipeline may be required to move its facilities at its own expense permits also have been obtained from railroad companies to run along or cross over or under lands or rightsofway many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election some such permits require annual or other periodic payments in a few minor cases property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this document realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are dependent on cash distributions received from kmp 

 

approximately 97 and 95 of the distributions we received from our subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively were attributable to kmp a decline in kmp’s revenues or increases in its general and administrative expenses principal and interest payments under existing and future debt instruments expenditures for taxes working capital requirements or other cash needs will limit the amount of cash kmp can distribute to us which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders which could be material 

 

new regulations rulemaking and oversight as well as changes in regulations by regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations could adversely impact our income and operations 

 

our pipelines and storage facilities are subject to regulation and oversight by federal state and local regulatory authorities such as the ferc the cpuc and the neb regulatory actions taken by these agencies have the potential to adversely affect our profitability regulation affects almost every part of our business and extends to such matters as i rates which include reservation commodity surcharges fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for operating terms and conditions of service ii the types of services we may offer to our customers iii the contracts for service entered into with our customers iv the certification and construction of new facilities v the integrity safety and security of facilities and operations vi the acquisition of other businesses vii the acquisition extension disposition or abandonment of services or facilities viii reporting and information posting requirements ix the maintenance of accounts and records and x relationships with affiliated companies involved in various aspects of the natural gas and energy businesses 

 

should we fail to comply with any applicable statutes rules regulations and orders of such regulatory authorities we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 

 

new regulations sometimes arise from unexpected sources for example the department of homeland security appropriation act of 2007 required the dhs to issue regulations establishing riskbased performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk” new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations including unexpected policy changes applicable to us or our assets could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—regulation” 

 

pending ferc and cpuc proceedings seek substantial refunds and reductions in tariff rates on some of our pipelines if the proceedings are determined adversely to us they could have a material adverse impact on us 

 

regulators and shippers on our pipelines have rights to challenge and have challenged the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations some shippers on our pipelines have filed complaints with the ferc and the cpuc that seek substantial refunds for alleged overcharges during the years in question and prospective reductions in the tariff rates on our pacific operations’ pipeline system further the ferc has initiated an investigation to determine whether some interstate natural gas pipelines including kmp’s kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline have overcollected on rates charged to shippers ngpl recently settled a proceeding brought by the ferc with respect to the rates charged by ngpl this settlement will result in a reduction in the rates it may charge in the future we may face challenges similar to those described in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report to the rates we charge on kmp’s pipelines any successful challenge could materially adversely affect our future earnings cash flows and financial condition 

 

energy commodity transportation and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

 

there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent to natural gas transmission and storage activities and refined petroleum products and carbon dioxide transportation activities—such as leaks explosions and mechanical problems—that could result in substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury and loss 

 

  

  

 

 

of human life significant damage to property and natural resources environmental pollution and impairment of operations any of which also could result in substantial financial losses for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers industrial sites and other public gathering areas the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater incidents that cause an interruption of service such as when unrelated third party construction damages a pipeline or a newly completed expansion experiences a weld failure may negatively impact our revenues and earnings while the affected asset is temporarily out of service in addition if losses in excess of our insurance coverage were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines will require us to spend additional money to comply with these requirements 

 

we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to asset integrity the us dot for example regulates pipelines and certain terminal facilities in the areas of testing education training and communication the us dot issued final rules effective february 2004 with respect to natural gas pipelines requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rules refer to as “high consequence areas” the ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict the majority of the costs to comply with the rules are associated with asset integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary changes such as advances of inspection tools identification of additional threats to integrity and changes to the amount of pipeline determined to be located in “high consequence areas” can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs we plan to continue our integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future assets as required by the us dot rules the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our assets 

 

further additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future or a new interpretation of existing laws and regulations could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for asset integrity regulation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not deemed by regulators to be fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects 

 

we may face competition from competing pipelines and other forms of transportation into the markets we serve as well as with respect to the supply for our pipeline systems 

 

any current or future pipeline system or other form of transportation that delivers crude oil petroleum products or natural gas into the markets that our pipelines serve could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price location facilities or other factors to the extent that an excess of supply into these market areas is created and persists our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates or otherwise to retain existing customers could be impaired we also could experience competition for the supply of crude oil petroleum products or natural gas from both existing and proposed pipeline systems several pipelines access many of the same areas of supply as our pipeline systems and transport to markets not served by us 

 

cost overruns and delays on our expansion and new build projects could adversely affect our business 

 

kmp recently completed several major expansion and new build projects including the joint venture projects rockies express pipeline midcontinent express pipeline and fayetteville express pipeline kmp also is conducting what are referred to as “open seasons” to evaluate the potential for new construction alone or with others in some areas of shale gas formations a variety of factors outside of our control such as weather natural disasters and difficulties in obtaining permits and rightsofway or other regulatory approvals as well as performance by thirdparty contractors has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs or delays in construction significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project could have a material adverse effect on our return on investment results of operations and cash flows 

 

we must either obtain the right from landowners or exercise the power of eminent domain in order to use most of the land on which our pipelines are constructed and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use 

 

we obtain the right to construct and operate pipelines on other owners’ land for a period of time if we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines our business could be affected negatively in addition we are subject to the possibility of increased costs under our rental agreements with landowners primarily through rental increases and 

 

  

  

 

 

renewals of expired agreements 

 

whether kmp has the power of eminent domain for its pipelines other than interstate natural gas pipelines varies from state to state depending upon the type of pipeline—petroleum liquids natural gas or carbon dioxide—and the laws of the particular state kmp’s interstate natural gas pipelines have federal eminent domain authority in either case kmp must compensate landowners for the use of their property and in eminent domain actions such compensation may be determined by a court kmp’s inability to exercise the power of eminent domain could negatively affect its business if it were to lose the right to use or occupy the property on which its pipelines are located   

 

kmp’s acquisition strategy and expansion programs require access to new capital tightened capital markets or more expensive capital would impair our ability to grow 

 

consistent with the terms of kmp’s partnership agreement it has distributed most of the cash generated by its operations as a result kmp has relied on external financing sources including commercial borrowings and issuances of debt and equity securities to fund its acquisition and growth capital expenditures however to the extent kmp is unable to continue to finance growth externally kmp’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow kmp may need new capital to finance these activities limitations on kmp’s access to capital will impair its ability to execute this strategy kmp historically has funded most of these activities with shortterm debt and repaid such debt through the subsequent issuance of equity and longterm debt an inability to access the capital markets particularly the equity markets will impair kmp’s ability to execute this strategy and have a detrimental impact on its credit profile 

 

kmp’s rapid growth may cause difficulties integrating and constructing new operations and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from any future acquisitions 

 

part of kmp’s business strategy includes acquiring additional businesses expanding existing assets and constructing new facilities if kmp does not successfully integrate acquisitions expansions or newly constructed facilities it may not realize anticipated operating advantages and cost savings the integration of companies that have previously operated separately involves a number of risks including i demands on management related to the increase in its size after an acquisition expansion or completed construction project ii the diversion of management’s attention from the management of daily operations iii difficulties in implementing or unanticipated costs of accounting estimating reporting and other systems iv difficulties in the assimilation and retention of necessary employees and v potential adverse effects on operating results 

 

kmp may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies have achieved or might achieve separately successful integration of each acquisition expansion or construction project will depend upon its ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs because of difficulties in combining and expanding operations kmp may not be able to achieve the cost savings and other sizerelated benefits that it hoped to achieve after these acquisitions which would harm its financial condition and results of operations 

 

environmental health and safety laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs and liabilities 

 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment natural resources and human health and safety such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations and generally require us to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations licenses permits inspections and other approvals liability under such laws and regulations may be incurred without regard to fault under cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the federal clean water act or analogous state or canadian laws for the remediation of contaminated areas private parties including the owners of properties through which our pipelines pass also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with such laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs andor may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us 

 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may expose us to civil criminal and administrative fines penalties andor interruptions in our operations that could influence our business financial position results of operations and prospects for example if an accidental leak release or spill of liquid petroleum products chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines or our storage or other facilities we may experience significant operational disruptions and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak release or spill pay for government penalties address natural resource damage compensate for human exposure or property damage install costly pollution control equipment or undertake a combination of these and other measures the resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flows in addition emission controls 

 

  

  

 

 

required under the federal clean air act and other similar federal state and provincial laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 

 

we own andor operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with our business activities while we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances may have been released at or from properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors or at or from properties where our or our predecessors’ wastes have been taken for disposal in addition many of these properties have been owned andor operated by third parties whose management handling and disposal of hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances were not under our control these properties and the hazardous substances released and wastes disposed on them may be subject to laws in the united states such as cercla which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct under the regulatory schemes of the various canadian provinces such as british columbia’s environmental management act canada has similar laws with respect to properties owned operated or used by us or our predecessors under such laws and implementing regulations we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination including contamination caused by prior owners or operators imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 

 

in addition our oil and gas development and production activities are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control these laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation specifically these activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding the acquisition of permits before drilling restrictions on drilling activities in restricted areas emissions into the environment water discharges and storage and disposition of wastes in addition legislation has been enacted that requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state authorities 

 

further we cannot ensure that such existing laws and regulations will not be revised or that new laws or regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters” 

 

climate change regulation at the federal state provincial or regional levels could result in increased operating and capital costs for us 

 

methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of the burning of natural gas are examples of greenhouse gases the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the us epa began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions of certain stationary sources on january 2 2011 and has issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources fractionated natural gas liquids and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide like kmp’s mcelmo dome carbon dioxide field even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere 

 

because our operations including our compressor stations and natural gas processing plants in our ngpl pipeco llc natural gas pipelines—kmp and co 2 —kmp business segments emit various types of greenhouse gases primarily methane and carbon dioxide such new legislation or regulation could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and require us to install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs however they could be significant recovery of such increased costs from our customers is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond our control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the ferc and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects for more information about climate change regulation see items 1 and 2 “business and properties—c narrative description of business—environmental matters—climate change” 

 

increased regulation of exploration and production activities including hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells which could adversely impact kmp’s revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas transported on kmp’s or its joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines 

 

  

  

 

 

the natural gas industry is increasingly relying on natural gas supplies from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane natural gas extracted from these sources frequently requires hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing involves the pressurized injection of water sand and chemicals into the geologic formation to stimulate gas production and is a commonly used stimulation process employed by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells recently there have been initiatives at the federal and state levels to regulate or otherwise restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators which could reduce their production of natural gas and in turn adversely affect kmp’s revenues and results of operations by decreasing the volumes of natural gas gathered treated processed and transported on our kmp’s or kmp joint ventures’ natural gas pipelines several of which gather gas from areas in which the use of hydraulic fracturing is prevalent 

 

kmp’s substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 

 

as of december 31 2010 kmp and its subsidiaries had 115 billion of consolidated debt excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements this level of debt could have important consequences such as i limiting kmp’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund its working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes ii limiting kmp’s ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business or to pay distributions because it must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on its debt iii placing kmp at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt and iv increasing kmp’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

 

kmp’s ability to service its debt will depend upon among other things its future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond its control if kmp’s operating results are not sufficient to service its indebtedness or any future indebtedness that it incurs we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions reducing or delaying its business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital kmp may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all for more information about its debt see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

kmp’s large amount of variable rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

 

as of december 31 2010 54 billion 47 of kmp’s total 115 billion consolidated debt excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements was subject to variable interest rates either as shortterm or longterm debt of variable rate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps should interest rates increase the amount of cash required to service this debt would increase and kmp’s earnings could be adversely affected for more information about kmp’s interest rate risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk” 

 

we do not have an investment grade credit rating which may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

 

since the going private transaction kinder morgan kansas inc’s credit ratings have been below investment grade as a result we have not had access to the commercial paper market and have utilized kinder morgan kansas inc’s 10 billion revolving credit facility for our shortterm borrowing needs noninvestment grade credit ratings limit our access to the debt markets and increase our cost of capital the instruments governing any future debt may contain more restrictive covenants than if we had investment grade credit ratings our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed may be restricted by these covenants a downgrade in one or more of kmp’s credit ratings would similarly affect kmp 

 

our debt instruments may limit our financial flexibility and increase our financing costs 

 

the instruments governing our debt contain restrictive covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that we deem beneficial and that may be beneficial to us the agreements governing our debt generally require us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on i incurring additional debt ii entering into mergers consolidations and sales of assets iii granting liens and iv entering into saleleaseback transactions the instruments governing any future debt may contain similar or more restrictive restrictions our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing if needed may be restricted 

 

  

  

 

 

there is the potential for a change of control of the general partner of kmp if kinder morgan kansas inc or we default on debt  

 

kinder morgan kansas inc our wholly owned subsidiary owns all of the common equity of kinder morgan gp inc the general partner of kmp if kinder morgan kansas inc or we default on debt then the lenders under such debt in exercising their rights as lenders could acquire control of kinder morgan gp inc or otherwise influence kinder morgan gp inc through their control of kinder morgan kansas inc or us a change of control of kinder morgan gp inc could materially adversely affect the distributions we receive from kmp which could have a material adverse impact on us or our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

 

current or future distressed financial conditions of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide   

 

some of our customers are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows furthermore the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities in addition such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

terrorist attacks or the threat of them may adversely affect our business  

 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these potential targets might include our pipeline systems or storage facilities our operations could become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that would require increased security measures there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the near future these developments may subject our operations to increased risks as well as increased costs and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

future business development of our pipelines is dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities transported by our pipelines 

 

our pipelines depend on production of natural gas oil and other products in the areas served by our pipelines without reserve additions production will decline over time as reserves are depleted and production costs may rise producers may shut down production at lower product prices or higher production costs especially where the existing cost of production exceeds other extraction methodologies such as in the alberta oil sands producers in areas served by us may not be successful in exploring for and developing additional reserves and our gas plants and pipelines may not be able to maintain existing volumes of throughput commodity prices and tax incentives may not remain at a level that encourages producers to explore for and develop additional reserves produce existing marginal reserves or renew transportation contracts as they expire more over we do not have volume commitments from the operators of the acreage that has been dedicated to our gathering systems 

 

changes in the business environment such as a decline in crude oil or natural gas prices an increase in production costs from higher feedstock prices supply disruptions or higher development costs could result in a slowing of supply from oil and natural gas producing areas in addition with respect to the co 2 –kmp business segment changes in the regulatory environment or governmental policies may have an impact on the supply of crude oil each of these factors impact our customers shipping through our pipelines which in turn could impact the prospects of new transportation contracts or renewals of existing contracts 

 

throughput on kmp’s crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products pipelines also may decline as a result of changes in business conditions over the long term business will depend in part on the level of demand for oil natural gas and refined petroleum products in the geographic areas in which deliveries are made by pipelines and the ability and willingness of shippers having access or rights to utilize the pipelines to supply such demand 

 

the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the oil and gas industry could reduce demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products increase our costs and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the impact of future 

 

  

  

 

 

economic conditions fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices all of which could reduce the demand for natural gas crude oil and refined petroleum products 

 

the future success of kmp’s oil and gas development and production operations depends in part upon its ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

 

the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted without successful development activities the reserves and revenues of the oil producing assets within the co 2 —kmp business segment will decline kmp may not be able to develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have necessary financing for these activities in the future additionally if kmp does not realize production volumes greater than or equal to its hedged volumes it may suffer financial losses not offset by physical transactions 

 

kmp’s development of oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment 

 

the business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome acquisition and development decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that while they may be reasonable are by their nature speculative it is impossible to predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well furthermore the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment a variety of geological operational and marketrelated factors including but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological formations pressures equipment failures or accidents fires explosions blowouts cratering pollution and other environmental risks shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment loss of circulation of drilling fluids or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable a productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil andor gas from the well in addition production from any well may be unmarketable if it is contaminated with water or other deleterious substances 

 

the volatility of natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on kmp’s business 

 

the revenues profitability and future growth of the co 2 —kmp business segment and the carrying value of its oil natural gas liquids and natural gas properties depend to a large degree on prevailing oil and gas prices for 2011 kmp estimates that every 1 change in the average west texas intermediate crude oil price per barrel would impact the co 2 —kmp segment’s cash flows by approximately 55 million prices for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil natural gas liquids and natural gas uncertainties within the market and a variety of other factors beyond kmp’s control these factors include among other things i weather conditions and events such as hurricanes in the united states ii the condition of the united states economy iii the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries iv governmental regulation v political stability in the middle east and elsewhere vi the foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas vii the price of foreign imports and viii the availability of alternative fuel sources 

 

a sharp decline in the price of natural gas natural gas liquids or oil would result in a commensurate reduction in kmp’s revenues income and cash flows from the production of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of kmp’s proved reserves in the event prices fall substantially kmp may not be able to realize a profit from its production and would operate at a loss in recent decades there have been periods of both worldwide overproduction and underproduction of hydrocarbons and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts such conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of and reduced demand for crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a domestic basis these periods have been followed by periods of short supply of and increased demand for crude oil and natural gas the excess or short supply of crude oil or natural gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand these fluctuations impact the accuracy of assumptions used in our budgeting process for more information about kmp’s energy and commodity market risk see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk— energy commodity market risk” 

 

our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income 

 

we engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when production is less than expected when the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received in 

 

  

  

 

 

addition these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

 

the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex and even when we engage in hedging transactions for example to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices or currency exchange rates or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates that are effective economically these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes accordingly our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges even when there is no underlying economic impact at the dates of those statements in addition it is not always possible for us to engage in hedging transactions that completely mitigate our exposure to commodity prices our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for more information about our hedging activities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—hedging activities” 

 

the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 

 

the us congress recently adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation known as the doddfrank act that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the doddfrank act was signed into law by the president on july 21 2010 and requires the commodities futures trading commission or cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment the act also requires the cftc to institute broad new position limits for futures and options traded on regulated exchanges as the law favors exchange trading and clearing the doddfrank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time the doddfrank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us the doddfrank act and any new regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 

 

if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the kinder morgan canada—kmp segment is subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 

 

we are a us dollar reporting company as a result of the operations of the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment a portion of our consolidated assets liabilities revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars fluctuations in the exchange rate between united states and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our stockholders’ equity under applicable accounting rules 

 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries including the oil and gas industry the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states and canada volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us in addition decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of the co 2 —kmp business segment if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

  

 

 

hurricanes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

some of our pipelines terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers in either case losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially 

 

kmp’s tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation by individual states if the internal revenue service were to treat kmp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or if it was to become subject to a material amount of entitylevel taxation for state tax purposes then its cash available for distribution to its partners including us would be substantially reduced 

 

we own the general partner interest and approximately 11 of the limited partner interests of kmp the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of our investment in kmp depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes to maintain its status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes current law requires that 90 or more of its gross income for every taxable year consist of “qualifying income” as defined in section 7704 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code kmp has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service which we refer to as the irs on this or any other matter affecting it 

 

despite the fact that kmp is a limited partnership under delaware law it is possible under certain circumstances for such an entity to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes if kmp were to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes it would pay us federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate which is currently a maximum of 35 and would pay state income taxes at varying rates distributions by kmp to its partners including us would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income gains losses or deductions would flow through to its partners including us because a tax would be imposed on kmp as a corporation the cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced therefore treatment of kmp as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and aftertax return to its partners including us likely causing a substantial reduction in the amount of distributions we receive from kmp in the value of our investment in kmp and in the value of our common stock 

 

current law or kmp’s business may change so as to cause it to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject it to entitylevel taxation members of congress are considering substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that would affect the tax treatment of certain publiclytraded partnerships for example federal income tax legislation recently has been considered by congress that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publiclytraded partnerships although the legislation most recently considered by congress would not appear to affect kmp’s tax treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict whether any other proposals will ultimately be enacted any such changes could negatively impact our cash flows the value of our investment in kmp and the value of our common stock 

in addition because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entitylevel taxation through the imposition of state income franchise or other forms of taxation for example kmp is now subject to an entitylevel tax on the portion of its total revenue that is generated in texas specifically the texas margin tax is imposed at a maximum effective rate of 07 of kmp’s total gross income that is apportioned to texas this tax reduces and the imposition of such a tax on kmp by another state will reduce the cash available for distribution by kmp to its partners including us 

 

kmp’s partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted that subjects it to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects it to entitylevel taxation for us federal income tax purposes the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact on it of that law 

 

kmp has adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income gain loss and deduction between it and its unitholders the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of kmp’s common units 

 

when kmp issues additional units or engages in certain other transactions it determines the fair market value of its assets and allocates any unrealized gain or loss attributable to its assets to the capital accounts of its unitholders and us 

 

  

  

 

 

this methodology may be viewed as understating the value of kmp’s assets in that case there may be a shift of income gain loss and deduction between certain unitholders and us which may be unfavorable to such unitholders moreover under kmp’s current valuation methods subsequent purchasers of its common units may have a greater portion of their adjustment under section 743b of the code allocated to its tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to its intangible assets the irs may challenge these valuation methods or kmp’s allocation of the adjustment under section 743b of the code attributable to its tangible and intangible assets and allocations of income gain loss and deduction between us and certain of its unitholders 

 

a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to kmp’s unitholders including us it also could affect the amount of gain from kmp’s unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to its unitholders’ or the general partner’s tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 

 

kmp treats each purchaser of its common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of the common units 

 

because kmp cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons kmp adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations kmp’s counsel is unable to opine on the validity of such filing positions a successful irs challenge to these positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a unitholder such as us it could also affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from any sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder’s tax returns 

 

if kmp’s unitholders remove the general partner we would lose our general partner interest including the right to incentive distributions and the ability to manage kmp 

 

we own the general partner of kmp and all of the voting shares of kmr to which the general partner has delegated its rights and powers to control the business and affairs of kmp subject to the approval of the general partner for certain actions kmp’s partnership agreement however gives unitholders of kmp the right to remove the general partner if•i the holders of 66 2⁄3 of kmp’s outstanding units including the common units class b units and iunits voting as a single class vote for such removal in such a vote the common units and class b units owned by the general partner and its affiliates would be excluded a number of iunits equal to the number of kmr shares owned by the general partner and its affiliates also would be excluded and the remaining iunits would be voted in the same proportion as the vote of the other holders of the kmr shares ii the holders of kmp’s outstanding units approve the election and succession of a new general partner by the same vote and iii kmp receives an opinion of counsel that the removal and succession of the general partner would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any limited partner of kmp or its operating partnership subsidiaries or cause kmp or its operating partnership subsidiaries to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

 

if the general partner were removed as general partner of kmp it would lose its ability to manage kmp and its delegation of authority to kmr would terminate at the same time the general partner would receive cash or common units in exchange for its general partner interest while the cash or common units the general partner would receive are intended under the terms of kmp’s partnership agreement to fully compensate us as the owner of the general partner in the event such an exchange is required the value of the investments we might make with the cash or the common units may not over time be equivalent to the value of the general partner interest and the related incentive distributions had the general partner retained its general partner interest 

 

if in the future kmr and the general partner cease to manage and control kmp we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 

 

if our subsidiaries kmr and kinder morgan gp inc which is the general partner of kmp cease to manage and control kmp we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 in that case we would either have to register as an investment company under the investment company act obtain exemptive relief from the sec or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company registering as an investment company could among other things materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

 

  

  

 

 

if we are unable to retain our executive officers our growth may be hindered 

 

our success depends in part on the performance of and our ability to retain our executive officers particularly our chairman and chief executive officer richard d kinder who is also one of our founders along with the other members of our senior management mr kinder has been responsible for developing and executing our growth strategy since 1997 if we are not successful in retaining mr kinder or our other executive officers or replacing them our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we do not maintain key personnel insurance 

 

risks related to the ownership of our common stock 

 

future sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock by holders of our class a class b and class c shares or us could cause the share price to decline and future issuances by us may dilute the ownership interest in our company of our stockholders 

 

we are unable to predict when or whether significant amounts of our common stock will be sold by the sponsor investors holders of our class a class b and class c shares   or us the class a shares are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock and the class b shares and class c shares may convert into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances the sponsor investors and richard d kinder have the right to require us to register resales of shares of our common stock received upon the conversion of their class a shares at any time subject to certain limitations including in the case of mr kinder transfer restrictions any future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market by our current holders or us or the perception that these sales might occur could lower the market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and price we deem appropriate further if we issue additional common stock or convertible securities to raise additional capital the ownership interest in our company of our stockholders may be diluted and the value of our stockholders’ investments may be reduced we also may issue common stock or convertible securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments if any such acquisition or investment is significant the number of shares or convertible securities that we may issue could be significant 

 

the price of the common stock may be volatile and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investments 

 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is often unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities the market price of the common stock could be similarly volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the common stock due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

 

specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for the common stock include i changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding the common stock the common units of kmp other companies comparable to us or kmp or companies in the industries we serve ii actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects iii• reaction to our public announcements iv strategic actions taken by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings v the recruitment or departure of key personnel vi new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations vii changes in tax or accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles viii adverse conditions in the financial markets or general us or international economic conditions including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism and responses to such events ix sales of common stock by us members of our management team or significant stockholders and x the extent of analysts’ interest in following our company 

 

we are a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and although we do not currently intend to rely on exemptions from various corporate governance requirements we may rely on such exemptions in the future 

 

a company of which more than 50 of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual a group or another company is a ‘‘controlled company’’ within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules a ‘‘controlled company’’ may elect not to comply with various corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange including the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors the requirement that its nominating and governance committee consist of all independent directors and the requirement that its compensation committee consist of all independent directors 

 

  

  

 

 

we believe that we are a ‘‘controlled company’’ since the sponsor investors and richard d kinder collectively hold approximately 800 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the election of directors and they have agreed to vote together on certain matters pursuant to our shareholders agreement including on the election of our directors 

 

although we currently do not intend to rely on the ‘‘controlled company’’ exemption to the board of directors and committee composition requirements under the new york stock exchange rules we may decide in the future to rely on that exemption in addition under our shareholders agreement if at any time our board of directors does not meet the majority independence requirements of the new york stock exchange or any other national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed for trading we will be obligated to operate under a ‘‘controlled company’’ exemption to the extent such an exemption is available to us at that time if we rely on that exemption our stockholders may not have the same corporate governance advantages afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

 

our organizational documents and provisions of delaware law we have elected to apply to us contain additional approval requirements for certain changes of control that may inhibit a takeover which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

our shareholders agreement prohibits us from directly or indirectly engaging in any merger amalgamation consolidation or other business combination or similar transaction or series of transactions other than for solely cash consideration without obtaining the unanimous approval of our shareholders unless the organizational documents and capital structure of the acquiring surviving or resulting entity preserve in all material respects the economic and other rights including conversion transfer distribution and governance rights as set forth in our certificate of incorporation bylaws and shareholders agreement characteristics and tax treatment including on a relative basis of the sponsor investors the class a shares the class b shares the class c shares and the shares of our common stock as they exist on the date of such transaction a determination that a transaction meets the above requirements requires approval by each of the following i sponsor investors holding a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote for the election of directors then held by sponsor investors that hold class a shares ii richard d kinder so long as he and his permitted transferees hold class a shares iii holders of a majority of our outstanding class b shares and iv holders of a majority of our outstanding class c shares these provisions will apply even if the offer is considered beneficial by some of our stockholders if all requisite shareholders other than the holders of class c shares approve such a transaction we generally may engage in such transaction so long as the class c shares receive the consideration provided in our charter in addition if the transaction is otherwise approved by the requisite holders of our capital stock the sponsor investors and mr kinder may decide that the holders of common stock class a shares class b shares and class c shares receive the consideration provided in our charter regardless of whether such transaction is determined to meet the above requirements in addition our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock which if issued could include special class voting rights on a change of control transaction also for so long as the sponsor investors collectively have the right to nominate at least five of our directors change of control transactions will require supermajority board approval if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented the market price of our common stock could decline further as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law referred to in this report as the ‘‘dgcl’’ section 203 limits the ability of interested stockholders which are certain stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us neither richard d kinder nor any sponsor investors that are interested stockholders fall within this limitation and we have elected not to opt out of this provision accordingly section 203 will apply to any stockholder that becomes an interested stockholder after that date these provisions could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish transactions other stockholders might deem desirable 

 

nonus holders of our common stock may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on the disposition of our common stock 

 

if we are or have been a ‘‘united states real property holding corporation’’ within the meaning of the code at any time within the shorter of i the fiveyear period preceding a disposition of our common stock by a nonus holder or ii such holder’s holding period for such common stock and assuming our common stock is ‘‘regularly traded’’ as defined by applicable us treasury regulations on an established securities market the nonus holder may be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain on such disposition if it held more than 5 of our common stock during the shorter of periods i and ii above we believe we are or may become a united states real property holding corporation 

 

  

  

 

 

risks related to our dividend policy 

 

holders of our common stock may not receive the anticipated level of dividends under our dividend policy or any dividends at all 

 

our dividend policy provides that subject to applicable law we will pay quarterly cash dividends generally representing the cash we receive from our subsidiaries less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes however our board of directors subject to the requirements of our bylaws and other governance documents may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and even while the current policy is in place the actual amount of dividends on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities capital requirements of our subsidiaries legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors dividends other than as provided in our dividend policy require supermajority board approval while the sponsor investors maintain prescribed ownership thresholds 

 

over time our capital and other cash needs may change significantly from our current needs which could affect whether we pay dividends and the amount of any dividends we may pay in the future the terms of any future indebtedness we incur also may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our stock under certain circumstances a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result if our board of directors establishes large reserves that reduce the amount of quarterly dividends paid or if we reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

 

the general partner of kmp with our consent but without the consent of our stockholders may take steps to support kmp that have the effect of reducing cash we have or are entitled to receive thereby reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends 

 

we utilize kmp as our vehicle for growth we have historically received a significant portion of our cash flows from incentive distributions on the general partner interest as the owner of the general partner of kmp we may take steps we judge beneficial to kmp’s growth that in the shortrun reduce the cash we receive and have available to pay dividends the board of directors of the general partner of kmp may determine to support a desirable acquisition that may not be immediately accretive to cash available for distribution per kmp partnership unit for example the general partner with our consent waived its incentive distributions from the second quarter of 2010 through 2011 on common units issued to finance a portion of kmp’s acquisition of a 50 interest in the kinderhawk joint venture an example of action we took to support kmp occurred in 2006 when kmp had missed the annual growth and earningsdistribution targets under its bonus plan which would have resulted in no bonus payments for employees for their service to kmp we believed that those bonuses were appropriate and in our and kmp’s interest so we funded the bonuses by waiving a portion of the general partner’s incentive distribution similar or different actions in the future even if determined to be in our longterm best interests will have the effect of reducing the cash we have or are entitled to receive from kmp and reducing the cash we have available to pay dividends 

 

our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities above the kmp level or impair our financial flexibility 

 

if we pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to finance growth opportunities above the kmp level meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements or fund our operations in the event of a significant business downturn in addition because of the dividends required under our dividend policy our ability to pursue any material expansion of our business above the kmp level including through acquisitions increased capital spending or other increases of our expenditures will depend more than it otherwise would on our ability to obtain third party financing we cannot assure our stockholders that such financing will be available to us at all or at an acceptable cost if we are unable to take timely advantage of growth opportunities our future financial condition and competitive position may be harmed which in turn may adversely affect the market price of our common stock further while the sponsor investors maintain specified ownership thresholds any changes to our dividend policy will require supermajority board approval which may prevent us from modifying our dividend policy to pursue such growth opportunities 

 

an increase in us federal income tax rates applicable to us would reduce the amount of our cash available to pay dividends further an increase in individual tax rates could encourage us to conclude that it would be better for our investors for us to use our cash to repurchase shares in the open market rather than pay dividends this too would reduce our cash available to pay dividends 

 

  

  

 

 

there currently is much public speculation regarding the future of us federal income tax rates we cannot predict whether legislation will be passed and become law that raises tax rates applicable to us or to individuals or if such legislation were to become law its effective date any increase in the corporate income tax rates applicable to us will reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends further any increase in individual tax rates could encourage our board of directors to conclude that it would be better for our investors if we were to use our cash to repurchase shares in the open market this too would reduce our cash available to pay dividends 

 

if we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to pay dividends 

 

all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries and our cash flow and our ability to satisfy obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries particularly kmp in addition our joint ventures and some of our subsidiaries such as kmp are not wholly owned by us when funds are distributed to us by such joint ventures and subsidiaries funds also will be distributed to their other owners 

 

each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and has no obligation to transfer funds to us a number of our subsidiaries are a party to credit facilities and are or may in the future be a party to other borrowing agreements that restrict the payment of dividends to us and such subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions will depend on their respective operating results and may be subject to further restrictions under among other things the laws of their jurisdiction of organization 

 

the board of directors of kmr which is the delegate of kmp’s general partner has broad authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of kmp’s business the establishment of those reserves could result in smaller distributions by kmp and a corresponding reduction of our cash available for dividends and our anticipated dividend level further the calculation of kmp’s available cash for distribution is at the discretion and subject to the approval of the board of directors of kmr taking into consideration the terms of kmp’s constituent agreements similarly while the constituent agreements of ngpl provide that it is the intention of ngpl to make distributions of available cash we own less than a majority of ngpl and do not control it the same is true for joint ventures in which kmp owns an interest such as rockies express pipeline llc midcontinent express pipeline llc fayetteville express pipeline llc and kinderhawk field services llc 

 

the distributions we receive from kmp are largely attributable to the incentive distributions on our general partner interest the distributions we receive are not as large if kmp distributes cash from interim capital transactions rather than cash from operations or if kmp’s general partner waives receipt of a portion of those incentive distributions 

 

as a result of the foregoing we may be unable to receive cash through distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries in sufficient amounts to pay dividends on our common stock if we are unable to authorize the payment of dividends due to insufficient cash a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders which could be substantial 

 

our ability to pay dividends will be restricted by delaware law 

 

under the dgcl our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of surplus as calculated in accordance with the dgcl or if we do not have a surplus it is paid out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year our bylaws require the declaration and payment of dividends to comply with the dgcl if as a result of these restrictions we are unable to authorize payment of dividends a decline in the market price or liquidity or both of our common stock could result this may in turn result in losses by our stockholders 

 

risks related to conflicts of interest 

 

the sponsor investors are in a position to affect our ongoing operations corporate transactions and other matters and their interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of our stockholders 

 

the sponsor investors collectively own a total of 568 of our class a shares which collectively represents approximately 473 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock for the election of directors and 488 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock for other matters as a result the sponsor investors are able to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for so long as the sponsor investors own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock even if less than a majority they will have the power to determine or 

 

  

  

 

 

significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws our shareholders agreement also provides the sponsor investors who continue to own at least 25 of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors with veto rights over specified actions that may impose a regulatory burden on such sponsor investors and requires us to reasonably cooperate with such sponsor investors and their affiliates to mitigate consequences of such actions we also are required to keep such sponsor investors informed of any events or changes with respect to any criminal or regulatory investigation or action involving us or any of our affiliates the interests of the sponsor investors may conflict with or differ from the interests of our stockholders 

 

the sponsor investors and holders of our class a class b and class c shares have the ability to nominate a majority of our board of directors 

 

in connection with the conversion transactions we entered into a shareholders agreement with the sponsor investors and the holders of our class a class b and class c shares pursuant to which the sponsor investors have the right to nominate six of the thirteen members of our board of directors and richard d kinder has the right to nominate five of the thirteen members of our board of directors in that agreement the sponsor investors and mr kinder agree with each other to vote all of their shares of capital stock in favor of those nominees two of the sponsor investors each have the right to nominate two directors as long as they each own 5 of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors those two sponsor investors and the other two sponsor investors each have the right to nominate one director as long as they each own 25 of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors mr kinder has the right to nominate five directors as long as he is our chief executive officer and owns at least 25 of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors if mr kinder is terminated as chief executive officer for cause he will retain the right to nominate one director which cannot be mr kinder himself if mr kinder ceases to be the chief executive officer for any reason other than as a result of termination for cause he will retain the right to nominate two directors one of whom can be mr kinder himself if mr kinder loses such nomination rights such rights will shift to the original stockholders and other management in specified circumstances accordingly even after the ownership in us of the holders of our class a class b and class c shares   has significantly declined they will be able to nominate the majority of our directors the class a shares owned by the sponsor investors and the class a shares and class b shares owned by mr kinder represent approximately 780 of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors with the sponsor investors in the aggregate holding approximately 473 of such total voting power and mr kinder holding approximately 307 of such total voting power accordingly the sponsor investors and mr kinder have not only the right to nominate 11 of our 13 directors but also the voting power to elect all 13 of our directors 

 

our organizational documents provide the directors nominated by the sponsor investors with a collective veto over substantially all of the actions required to be approved by our board of directors 

 

our bylaws require that substantially all actions brought before our board of directors while the sponsor investors collectively have the right to appoint at least five director nominees will require supermajority board approval which is defined as the affirmative vote of eight directors when our board of directors has twelve members while the sponsor investors collectively have the right to appoint five director nominees or thirteen members while the sponsor investors collectively have the right to appoint six director nominees as a result our board of directors will be unable to approve of any action by supermajority board approval if all of the directors nominated by the sponsor investors vote against such action the inability of our board of directors to approve specified actions by supermajority board approval as required by our bylaws could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if we are unable to take action on critical corporate matters 

 

our certificate of incorporation and shareholders agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities 

 

our certificate of incorporation and our shareholders agreement each provide that none of the sponsor investors the directors nominated by the sponsor investors the sponsor investors’ affiliates and subsidiaries nor any of their managers officers directors agents stockholders members or partners will have any duty to tell us about or offer to us any business opportunity even if it is the same business or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate these documents also provide that none of the sponsor investors nor their respective affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities for instance a director of our company who also serves as a director officer or employee of a sponsor investor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisition or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result such acquisition or other opportunities may not be available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on 

 

  

  

 

 

our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are pursued by such a sponsor investor or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of by us 

 

the sponsor investors and their affiliates may compete with us 

 

the sponsor investors and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and they may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsor investors and their affiliates also may pursue for their own account acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us we have waived certain potential conflicts of interest between us and the sponsor investors see ‘‘—our certificate of incorporation and shareholders agreement contain provisions renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities’’ as a result the sponsor investors and their affiliates may not be liable for pursuing business opportunities and not making them available to us these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are pursued by a sponsor investor or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of by us 

 

kmp and its subsidiaries may compete with us 

 

none of kmp or any of its subsidiaries or entities in which it owns an interest is restricted from competing with us kmr and the general partner of kmp have the same individuals on their boards of directors and a majority of those directors are independent kmr manages kmp subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of kmp’s general partner in what it considers to be the best interests of kmp and its partners kmp and its subsidiaries may acquire invest in or construct assets that may be in direct competition with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects among other things we and kmp have a policy that acquisition opportunities of businesses or operating assets will be pursued above the kmp level only if kmp elects not to pursue the opportunity 

 

actions taken by our board of directors and actions taken by the boards of directors of kmr and other of our subsidiaries may affect the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders 

 

the amount of cash that is available for dividends to our stockholders is affected by decisions of our board of directors and the boards of directors of kmr and others of our subsidiaries regarding such matters as i the amount and timing of cash expenditures including those relating to compensation ii the amount and timing of investments and dispositions iii our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries iv tax matters v reserves and vi our issuance of additional equity securities including common stock 

 

many of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries including kmr or entities in which we own an interest such as ngpl as a result of which conflicts of interest exist and will arise in the future 

 

many of our directors and officers are also directors or officers of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries including kmr which manages and controls kmp subject to certain decisions requiring the approval of kmp’s general partner and other entities in which we own an interest such as ngpl in making decisions in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of one of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries or such other entities such person may make a decision that favors the interests of such subsidiary over our interests or the interests of our stockholders and may be to our detriment however any officer or director of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries including kmr who is also a director or officer of ours in making decisions in such person’s capacity as our officer or director is required to act in accordance with his or her fiduciary duties to us further the organizational documents of many of these entities may have provisions reducing or eliminating the duties of their officers or directors to those entities and their owners including us in addition our directors are not required to work full time on our business and affairs and may devote significant time to the affairs of our nonwholly owned subsidiaries there could be material competition for the time and effort of our directors who provide services to our nonwholly owned subsidiaries 

 

common stockholders have no right to enforce obligations of the holders of our class a class b and class c shares and their affiliates under agreements with us 

 

any agreements between us on the one hand and the holders of our class a class b and class c shares and their affiliates on the other will not grant to the common stockholders separate and apart from us the right to enforce the obligations of the holders of our class a class b and class c shares and their affiliates in our favor purchasers of shares of common stock will not become parties to the shareholders agreement as a result holders of common stock will not be 

 

  

  

 

 

able to enforce any obligations under the shareholders agreement in the event that we decide not to pursue any remedies available to us under the shareholders agreement which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

contracts between us on the one hand and the holders of our class a class b and class c shares and their affiliates on the other will not be the result of arm’slength negotiations 

 

we may enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of the holders of our class a class b and class c shares   or their affiliates neither our charter or bylaws nor the shareholders agreement or any other agreements contracts and arrangements between us on the one hand and any of the holders of our class a class b and class c shares or their affiliates on the other are or will be the result of arm’slength negotiations our board of directors or a committee thereof will determine the terms of any of these transactions

our assets that currently generate cash for the payment of dividends and for other purposes consist primarily of our ownership of the general partner interest in kmp approximately 11 of the limited partner interests of kmp and a 20 interest in ngpl pipeco llc approximately 97 and 95 of the distributions we received from our subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively were attributable to kmp 

 

our business model through our ownership and operation of energy related assets and through our ownership of the general partner of kmp and kmr’s management of kmp’s operations is built to support two principal components 

 

 

 

 

 

to achieve these objectives we focus on providing feebased services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energyrelated pipelines bulk and liquids terminal facilities and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise and each of our business segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

 

our reportable business segments are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition during the historical periods presented in this report we had a business segment referred to as ‘‘power’’ which consisted of our ownership of natural gasfired electric generation facilities on october 22 2010 we sold our facility located in michigan referred to as ‘‘triton power’’ for approximately 150 million in cash and as a result in future periods we will no longer report power as a business segment see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states’ and canada’s various energy businesses and markets we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and a portion of our business portfolio including our kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment the canadian portion of our cochin pipeline and our bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currencybased transactions both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in uscanadian dollar exchange rates to help understand our reported operating results all of the following references to ‘‘currency translation impacts’’ ‘‘currency changes’’ or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results in us dollars resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar the references are made to facilitate periodtoperiod comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 

 

the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the petroleum products being shipped or stored demand for petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions demand tends to be relatively stable because of that we seek to own refined products pipelines located in or that transport to stable or growing markets and population centers the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index the regulatory returns on our products pipelines like our interstate natural gas pipelines and canadian pipelines mitigate the downside of these operations 

 

with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity these longterm contracts are typically structured with a fixedfee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity similarly in the texas intrastate pipeline business kmp has longterm transport and sales requirements with minimum volume payment obligations which secure approximately 75 of its sales and transport margins in that business therefore where we have longterm contracts we are not exposed to shortterm changes in commodity supply or demand however as contracts expire we do have exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas as of december 31 2010 the remaining average contract life of kmp’s natural gas transportation contracts including for its intrastate pipelines was approximately nine years 

 

the co 2   sales and transportation business like the natural gas pipelines business has primarily fixed fee contracts with minimum volume requirements which as of december 31 2010 had a remaining average contract life of 47 years on a volumeweighted basis approximately 76 of kmp’s contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee and 24 fluctuates with the price of oil in the longterm the success in this business is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide however shortterm changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts in the co 2 —kmp business segment’s oil and gas producing activities we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add in that regard our production during any period is an important measure in addition the revenues we receive 

 

  

  

 

 

from our crude oil natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products over the longterm we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products in the shorter term however market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management or hedging program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts particularly for crude oil the realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel with all hedges allocated to oil was 5996 per barrel in 2010 4955 per barrel in 2009 and 4942 per barrel in 2008 had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk our crude oil sales prices would have averaged 7693 per barrel in 2010 5902 per barrel in 2009 and 9770 per barrel in 2008 

 

the factors impacting the terminals—kmp business segment generally differs depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal and in the case of a bulk terminal the type of product being handled or stored as with our products pipeline transportation business the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle andor store as well as the prices we receive for our services which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals the primary products are coal petroleum coke and steel for the most part we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums because these contracts are volume based above the minimums our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions our liquids terminals business generally has longerterm contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity thus similar to our natural gas pipeline business our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to shortterm changes in supply and demand therefore the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which is typically approximately three years the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms with higher perunit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity in addition weatherrelated factors such as hurricanes floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and thus the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities for longer periods 

 

in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see “—results of operations” below we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods principally through kmp we believe that we have a history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses in 2010 we invested approximately 25 billion for both strategic business acquisitions and expansions of existing assets kmp’s capital investments have helped it to achieve compound annual growth rates in cash distributions to its limited partners of 48 81 and 70 respectively for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2010 

 

thus kmp’s ability to increase distributions to us and other investors will to some extent be a function of its successful completion of acquisitions and expansions we believe kmp will continue to have opportunities for expansion of its facilities in many markets and it has budgeted approximately 14 billion for its 2011 capital expansion program including small acquisitions and investment contributions based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 

 

kmp’s ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost and includes factors over which we have limited or no control thus we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 

 

in addition kmp’s ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand its assets is impacted by its ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions as a master limited partnership kmp distributes all of its available cash and it accesses capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions historically kmp has succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund its acquisitions and expansions often doing so during periods of notably tight financial conditions for example in december 2008 kmp raised a combined 675 million in cash from public debt and equity offerings although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening of loosening of credit we believe that our stable cash flows kmp’s investment grade credit rating and our historical record of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment distribution and acquisition strategies as well as refinance

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities our revenues and expenses during the reporting period and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations determine possible asset impairment charges and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test iii reserves for environmental claims legal fees transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables v exposures under contractual indemnifications and vi unbilled revenues 

 

for a summary of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others which policies are discussed as follows 

 

environmental matters 

 

with respect to our environmental exposure we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts we expense or capitalize as appropriate environmental expenditures that relate to current operations and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments andor remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs generally we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 

 

our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action but generally we recognize andor adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 

 

these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management’s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated in making these liability estimations we consider the effect of environmental compliance pending legal actions against us and potential third party liability claims for more information on our environmental disclosures see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

legal matters 

 

we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders judgments or settlements in general we expense legal costs as incurred accordingly to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates our earnings will be affected when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement generally if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount we record a liability equal to the low end of the range any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 

 

  

  

 

 

as of december 31 2010 one of our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved kmp’s west coast products pipelines transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines’ interstate and intrastate california rates respectively following the ferc’s approval of a settlement agreement kmp reached with certain shippers related to a substantial portion of its historical ferc rate challenges on the sfpp lp pipelines kmp made settlement payments totaling 2063 million in june 2010 a second settlement with the only remaining litigantshipper was filed at the ferc in february 2011 which will resolve the remaining historical ferc rate challenges on the sfpp lp pipelines the ferc has not yet acted on the second settlement for more information on our regulatory proceedings see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

in regards to our going private transaction litigation on september 8 2010 the parties entered into a 200 million settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated class action cases that were pending before the kansas trial court on november 19 2010 the settlement was approved by the kansas trial court and in december 2010 the settlement amount was paid into an escrow account that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives including goodwill are not subject to regular periodic amortization and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite instead the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may 31 of each year there were no impairment charges resulting from our may 31 2010 impairment testing and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date for more information on our goodwill see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

in conjunction with our annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill performed as of may 31 2008 we determined that the fair value of certain reporting units that are part of our investment in kmp were less than the carrying values the fair value of each reporting unit was determined from the present value of the expected future cash flows from the applicable reporting unit inclusive of a terminal value calculated using a market multiple for the individual assets the implied fair value of goodwill within each reporting unit was then compared to the carrying value of goodwill of each such unit resulting in the following goodwill impairments by reporting unit products pipelines—kmp excluding associated terminals 120 billion products pipelines terminals—kmp separate from products pipelines—kmp for goodwill impairment purposes—70 million natural gas pipelines—kmp—209 billion and terminals—kmp 677 million for a total impairment of 403 billion the goodwill impairment was a noncash charge and did not have any impact on our cash flow we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of may 31 2009 or 2010 and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to may 31 2010 

 

excluding goodwill our other intangible assets include customer relationships contracts and agreements technologybased assets and lease value these intangible assets have definite lives are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives and are reported separately as “other intangibles net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for more information on our amortizable intangibles see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

 

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves both developed and undeveloped the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect among other things whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 

 

proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions estimates of proved reserves may change either positively or negatively as additional information becomes available and as contractual economic and political conditions change for more information on our ownership interests 

 

  

  

 

 

in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

hedging activities 

 

we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives according to the provisions of current accounting standards to be considered effective changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 

 

since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices—a perfectly effective hedge—we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge for example when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations accordingly our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges for more information on our hedging activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

with respect to the amount of income or expense we recognize in association with our pension and retiree medical plans we must make a number of assumptions with respect to both future financial conditions for example medical costs returns on fund assets and market interest rates as well as future actions by plan participants for example when they will retire and how long they will live after retirement most of these assumptions have relatively minor impacts on the overall accounting recognition given to these plans but two assumptions in particular the discount rate and the assumed longterm rate of return on fund assets can have significant effects on the amount of expense recorded and liability recognized we review historical trends future expectations current and projected market conditions the general interest rate environment and benefit payment obligations to select these assumptions the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond the selection of these assumptions is further discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report while we believe our choices for these assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances other assumptions could be reasonably applied and therefore we note that at our current level of pension and retiree medical funding a change of 1 in the longterm return on assets assumption would increase decrease our annual retiree medical expense by approximately 06 million 06 million and would increase decrease our annual pension expense by 22 million 22 million in comparison to that recorded in 2009 similarly a 1 change in the discount rate would increase decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 75 million 68 million and would increase decrease our projected pension benefit obligation by 345 million 309 million compared to those balances as of december 31 2009 

 

income taxes 

 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached in addition we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed therefore we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate changes in our effective rate including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 

 

in determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments we have applied an accounting policy that looks through our investments including our investment in kmp the application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the nontaxdeductible goodwill portion of our investment in kmp 

 

  

  

 

 

going private transaction 

 

a going private transaction completed in may 2007 see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report was accounted for as a purchase business combination accordingly our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the going private transaction with the excess of the purchase price over these combined fair values recorded as goodwill 

 

results of operations 

 

the 2008 sale of our 80 interest in ngpl pipeco llc the 2008 goodwill impairments described in “—intangible assets” above the 2010 impairment charge related to our investment in ngpl pipeco llc the 2010 rate case liability adjustments the 2010 settlement of litigation related to the going private transaction and other acquisitions and divestitures including the transfer of certain assets to kmp among other factors affect comparisons of our financial position and results of operations between certain periods

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

our total revenues for 2010 and 2009 were 82 billion and 72 billion respectively for 2010 the net loss attributable to kinder morgan inc totaled 413 million as compared to income of 4950 million in 2009 net income attributable to kinder morgan inc for 2010 was negatively impacted by i a 128 million aftertax going private transaction litigation settlement ii approximately 107 million aftertax from a reduction in the income we recognized from our interest in the general partner due to a kmp distribution of cash from interim capital transactions and iii approximately 275 million aftertax from an investment impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2010 

 

for the comparable periods total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization sometimes referred to as ‘‘earnings before dda’’ decreased 2784 million 9 in 2010 however the overall decrease included a decrease in earnings of 6171 million from the combined effect of the certain items impacting earnings before dda described in the footnotes to the table above combining to affect total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization by a 5758 million decrease and a 413 million increase in 2010 and 2009 respectively the two primary items described in the footnotes to the table above contributing to the 5758 million decrease in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization for 2010 were i a 430 million pretax impairment of our investment in ngpl pipeco llc and ii a 172 million pretax expense associated with the products pipeline—kmp litigation the remaining 3387 million 11 increase in total segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2010 versus 2009 resulted from better performance from all five of kmp’s reportable business segments mainly due to increases attributable to the co 2 —kmp and terminals—kmp business segments the going private transaction litigation settlement and kmp interim capital transaction discussed in footnotes i and k to the above table respectively did not impact earnings before dda 

 

during 2010 kmp benefitted from i higher revenues from crude oil natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales due largely to the positive impact of higher energy prices—primarily in the last six months of the year—relative to 2009 ii incremental earnings from the shale gas gathering and treating services offered by the kinder morgan natural gas treating operations and kmp’s 50owned kinderhawk field services iii higher revenues from refined petroleum products delivery revenues by kmp’s west coast products pipelines and higher earnings from ethanol related handling activities at its west coast and southeast products terminal operations iv the positive impact from a full year of operations from kinder morgan louisiana and kmp’s 50owned midcontinent express natural gas pipeline systems and v incremental earnings from both newly acquired and expanded bulk and liquids terminal operations 

 

  

  

 

 

year ended december 31 2009 vs 2008 

 

our total revenues for 2009 and 2008 were 72 billion and 121 billion respectively for 2009 the net income attributable to kinder morgan inc totaled 05 billion as compared to a loss of 36 billion in 2008 the increase in kinder morgan inc’s net income for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to noncash goodwill impairment charges that were recorded in the second quarter of 2008 to each segment as follows products pipelines—kmp – 126 billion natural gas pipelines—kmp – 209 billion and terminals—kmp – 677 million for a total impairment of 403 billion 

 

impact of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss 

 

the impacts of the purchase method of accounting on segment earnings loss before dda relate primarily to the revaluation of the accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives accounted for as hedges in the co 2 —kmp and natural gas pipelines—kmp segments where there is an impact to segment earnings loss before dda from the going private transaction the impact is described in the individual business segment discussions which follow the effects on dda expense result from changes in the carrying values of certain tangible and intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 this revaluation results in changes to dda expense in periods subsequent to may 30 2007 the purchase accounting effects on “unallocable interest and other net” result principally from the revaluation of certain debt instruments to their estimated fair values as of may 30 2007 resulting in changes to interest expense in subsequent periods 

 

segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses 

 

certain items included in earnings from continuing operations are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance in general the items not included in segment results are interest expense general and administrative expenses dda and unallocable income taxes we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on segment earnings before dda in relation to the level of capital employed because kmp’s partnership agreement requires it to distribute 100 of its available cash to its partners on a quarterly basis kmp’s available cash consists primarily of all of its cash receipts less cash disbursements and changes in reserves we consider each period’s earnings before all noncash depreciation depletion and amortization expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our segments that are also segments of kmp we account for intersegment sales at market prices we account for the transfer of net assets between entities under common control by carrying forward the net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination transfers of net assets between entities under common control do not affect the income statement of the combined entity 

 

products pipelines—kmp 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 1906 million in 2010 511 million in 2009 and 12935 million in 2008 and decreased revenues by 51 million in 2008 following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment’s i earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses and ii operating revenues in both 2010 and 2009 when compared to the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the primary increases and decreases in the products pipelines—kmp business segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 were attributable to the following 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2009 versus year ended december 31 2008 

 

 

all of the assets and operations included in the products pipelines—kmp business segment reported higher earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2009 when compared to 2008 and the primary increases and decreases in earnings were attributable to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural gas pipelines—kmp 

 

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 70 million in 2010 increased earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 12 million in 2009 and decreased earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 20911 million in 2008 and increased revenues by 04 million in 2010 following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment’s i earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses and ii operating revenues in both 2010 and 2009 when compared to the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

 

  

 

the overall increase in the natural gas pipelines—kmp business segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by incremental contributions from both the kinder morgan natural gas treating operations and kmp’s 50owned kinderhawk field services llc and by the inclusion of a full year of operations from both its 50owned midcontinent express pipeline system and its fullyowned kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system 

 

kmp acquired the majority of the kinder morgan natural gas treating operations from crosstex energy inc on october 1 2009 and it acquired the remaining portion from gaschill inc on september 1 2010 the business consists of multiple natural gas treating plants predominantly located in texas and louisiana which are used to remove impurities and liquids from natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications combined the acquired treating assets contributed incremental earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of 338 million revenues of 481 million and operating expenses of 141 million in 2010 

 

kmp acquired its 50 ownership interest in kinderhawk field services llc on may 21 2010 the joint venture gathers and treats natural gas originating from the haynesville shale gas formation located in northwest louisiana petrohawk energy corporation owns the remaining 50 ownership interest 

 

  

  

 

 

the increase in earnings from kmp’s equity investment in the midcontinent express pipeline system was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations in 2010 and to an expansion of natural gas transportation service since the end of 2009 midcontinent express system initiated interim natural gas transportation service for its zone 1 pipeline segment on april 10 2009 achieved full zone 1 service on may 21 2009 and achieved full zone 2 service on august 1 2009 in addition in june 2010 midcontinent express completed two natural gas compression projects that increased zone 1 capacity from 15 to 18 billion cubic feet per day and zone 2 capacity from 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day the incremental capacity is fully subscribed with tenyear binding shipper agreements 

 

kmp commenced limited natural gas transportation service on its kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline system in april 2009 and it completed construction and began full transportation service on the system’s remaining portions on june 21 2009 for the comparable periods of 2010 and 2009 the increase in earnings consisted of a 366 million increase in system operating income revenues less operating expenses due mainly to incremental transportation service and a 225 million decrease in nonoperating other income primarily due to higher nonoperating other income realized in 2009 pursuant to ferc regulations governing allowances for capital funds that are used for pipeline construction costs an equity cost of capital allowance 

 

other yeartoyear increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2010 versus 2009 included the following

the overall increase in the segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by incremental contributions from the kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system and kmp’s equity investments in the midcontinent express and rockies express pipeline systems for the kinder morgan louisiana and midcontinent express pipelines the yeartoyear increases in earnings were due mainly to the commencement andor expansion of natural gas transportation service since the end of 2008 as described above 

 

for rockies express the increase in earnings was driven by higher equity earnings from both the completion and startup of the rockies expresseast pipeline segment described above and the inclusion of a full year of operations from the rockies expresswest pipeline segment which began initial pipeline service on january 12 2008 and began full operations on may 20 2008 the overall increase in earnings in 2009 versus 2008 was partly offset by a decrease in equity earnings due to approximately 60 miles of the rockies expresseast pipeline segment being shutdown due to a pipeline girth weld failure that occurred on november 14 2009 the rockies expresseast line was repaired following coordination with the us department of transportation and the affected segment returned to reduced capacity on january 27 2010 rockies expresseast returned to full service on february 6 2010 and kmp estimates the negative impact on its equity earnings from the pipeline’s failure in the fourth quarter of 2009 was approximately 16 million

the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales in both pairs of comparable years primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of the texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group with the variances from yeartoyear in both revenues and operating expenses mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group’s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold the intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas which is often stored andor transported on its pipelines and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased the increases and decreases in its natural gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in its natural gas purchase costs the intrastate group accounted for 88 89 and 95 respectively of the segment’s revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 and 94 95 and 97 respectively of the segment’s operating expenses in 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

co 2 —kmp 

 

 

 

 

the co 2 —kmp segment’s primary businesses involve the production marketing and transportation of both carbon dioxide commonly called co 2  and crude oil and the production and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids   we refer to the segment’s two primary businesses as its oil and gas producing activities and sales and transportation activities 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above increased both segment revenues and segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 580 million in 2010 821 million in 

 

  

  

 

 

2009 and increase segment revenues by 1362 million and segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 1359 million in 2008 for each of the segment’s two primary businesses following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment’s i earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses and ii operating revenues in both 2010 and 2009 when compared to the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

 

the segment’s overall increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher earnings from both its oil and gas producing activities and its sales and transportation activities the yearoveryear increase in earnings from oil and gas producing activities which include the operations associated with kmp’s ownership interests in oilproducing fields and natural gas processing plants was due mainly to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly the yearoveryear increase in earnings from the segment’s sales and transportation activities in 2010 was also primarily revenue related chiefly due to a 375 million 22 increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues the increase was mainly pricerelated driven by a 22 increase in the average sales price for carbon dioxide although kmp’s carbon dioxide sales volumes were essentially unchanged across both years kmp benefitted from higher average carbon dioxide sales prices in 2010 versus 2009 due to both continued strong customer demand for carbon dioxide’s use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area and to the positive impact on the portion of its carbon dioxide sales contracts that are tied to crude oil prices which increased since the end of 2009 

 

pipeline revenues from transporting both carbon dioxide and crude oil were essentially flat across 2010 and 2009 and for the co 2 —kmp segment combined total carbon dioxide delivery volumes decreased almost 3 in 2010 versus 2009 the decrease in delivery volumes was mainly due to kmp’s lower consumption of new carbon dioxide at both the sacroc and yates field units however carbon dioxide production from its southwest colorado source fields increased in 2010 and carbon dioxide delivery volumes on kmp’s 50owned cortez pipeline increased by 05 in 2010 both reflecting a slight increase in thirdparty sales compared to 2009 kmp’s sales and transportation activities also benefitted from a 50 million 123 decrease in income tax expenses in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to favorable adjustments to the segment’s accrued texas margin tax liabilities due to prior year overpayments

higher yearoveryear earnings from the segment’s oil and gas producing activities in 2009 more than offset lower earnings from its sales and transportation activities generally earnings from oil and gas producing activities align closely with revenues earned from both crude oil and natural gas plant products sales but the 1206 million 26 increase in earnings in 2009 was primarily due to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 844 million 28 decrease in the segment’s sales and transportation earnings in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by a 782 million 23 drop in revenues including both a 654 million 28 decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues and a 97 million 11 decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues the decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues was entirely price related as the segment’s average price received from carbon dioxide sales in 2009 decreased 36 compared to the prior year reducing revenues by 958 million the decrease resulting from the unfavorable price change more than offset a 304 million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues resulting from higher sales volumes total carbon dioxide sales volumes increased by 13 in 2009 due both to carbon dioxide expansion projects completed since the end of 2008 and to continued strong demand for carbon dioxide from tertiary oil recovery projects 

 

the decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues in 2009 versus 2008 was mainly due to lower carbon dioxide transportation revenues from the central basin pipeline and lower crude oil transportation revenues from the wink pipeline central basin’s revenues were negatively impacted by lower weighted average transportation rates due partly to the fact that a portion of its carbon dioxide transportation contracts is indexed to oil prices which were lower in 2009 wink’s drop in revenues in 2009 was primarily due to lower pipeline loss allowance revenues also resulting from lower market prices for crude oil relative to 2008

terminals—kmp 

 

 

 

 

the terminals—kmp business segment includes the operations of petroleum chemical and other liquids terminal facilities other than those included in the products pipelines—kmp segment and all of coal petroleum coke fertilizer steel ores and other drybulk material services facilities combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 62 million in 2010 increased earnings by 203 million in 2009 and decreased earnings by 6954 million in 2008 

 

in addition in each of the years 2010 2009 and 2008 kmp has made terminal acquisitions in order to gain access to new markets and to complement andor enlarge kmp’s existing terminal operations combined these acquired operations contributed incremental earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of 322 million revenues of 592 million and operating expenses of 273 million in 2010 and incremental earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization of 46 million revenues of 161 million and operating expenses of 115 million in 2009   all of the incremental 2010 and 2009 amounts listed above represent the earnings revenues and expenses from acquired terminals’ 

 

  

  

 

 

operations during the additional months of ownership in 2010 and 2009 respectively and do not include increases or decreases during the same months kmp owned the assets in the respective prior year for more information on kmp’s acquisitions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment’s i earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses and ii operating revenues in both 2010 and 2009 when compared to the respective prior year the changes represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations for all terminal operations owned during identical periods in both pairs of comparable years kmp groups its bulk and liquids terminal operations into regions based on geographic location andor primary operating function this structure allows kmp’s management to organize and evaluate segment performance and to help make operating decisions and allocate resources 

  

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the earnings increase in 2010 compared to 2009 from the gulf coast terminals were driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues mainly due to new and incremental customer agreements at higher rates and to the completion of various terminal expansion projects that increased liquids tank capacity since the end of 2009 for all liquids terminals combined kmp increased its liquids leasable capacity by 18 million barrels 32 during 2010 and at the same time its overall liquids utilization capacity rate the ratio of its actual leased capacity to its estimated potential capacity at the end of 2010 decreased by only 04 since the prior yearend 

 

the increase in earnings from the west region terminals was driven by incremental contributions from i the vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal located on the north shore of vancouver british columbia canada’s main harbor ii the kinder morgan north 40 terminal the crude oil tank farm kmp constructed near edmonton alberta canada iii the washington state terminals located in vancouver and longview washington and iv the portland oregon bulk terminal the combined increase in earnings was mainly due to higher transfer volumes of agricultural products and other bulk and liquids commodities higher rate tonnage and for the two canadian terminals favorable currency translation impacts from a strengthening of the canadian dollar since the end of 2009 

 

earnings from the southeast midriver and ohio valley terminals which are located in the southeast and central regions of the us also increased in 2010 due largely to increased steel volumes from rebounding steel consumption consistent with the ongoing economic recovery for the terminals—kmp segment combined total steel tonnage increased by 80 million tons 48 in 2010 when compared with the previous year 

 

the increase in earnings from the ethanol terminals was driven by incremental services offered by kmp’s unit train terminaling facilities located at richmond and lomita california in march 2010 kmp began operations at its newlybuilt richmond terminal which is serviced by the burlington northern santa fe railroad the increase in earnings from the lomita rail ethanol terminal was driven by incremental offloading and distribution volumes driven by california’s growing demand for reformulated fuel blend ethanol for the terminals—kmp segment combined ethanol volumes increased by 253 million barrels 78 in 2010 primarily due to the growth in demand from the state of california and to the incremental handling activities from the terminal assets kmp acquired from us development group llc in january 2010 

 

for 2010 earnings from the lower river louisiana terminal operations decreased compared to the prior year the decrease in earnings from the lower river terminals was primarily due to lower earnings from both the international marine terminals facility a multiproduct importexport facility located in port sulphur louisiana and owned 66 23 

  

  

 

by kmp and the westwego louisiana liquids terminal the decrease in imt’s earnings was due to both a general loss in business in 2010 and a 32 million property casualty gain recognized in 2009 on a vessel dock that was damaged in march 2008 in september 2010 imt experienced a catastrophic failure of its shiploader which negatively impacted its ability to load vessels the decrease in earnings from the westwego facility was primarily due to lower revenues resulting from a drop in petroleum fuel storage 

 

year ended december 31 2009 versus year ended december 31 2008 

 

 

the increase in earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses from the lower river louisiana terminals in 2009 compared to 2008 was due mainly to lower income tax expenses related to overall lower taxable income in many of kmp’s tax paying terminal subsidiaries and higher earnings realized from both the international marine terminals facility imt and the geismar louisiana drumming facility the increase in earnings from imt was largely due to both lower yearoveryear operating expenses in 2009 which more than offset corresponding drops in revenues resulting from less dockage fleeting and barge services and as discussed above a 32 million property casualty gain in the second quarter of 2009 the increase in earnings from the geismar facility was due to incremental terminal operations that began in the first quarter of 2009 

 

similar to the 2010 increase the increase in earnings from the gulf coast terminals in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues additional liquids storage capacity and additional ancillary terminal services combined the pasadena and galena park terminals brought an incremental 185 million barrels of liquids tankage capacity including incremental truck loading capacity online during 2009 

 

for all terminals combined total liquids throughput volumes in 2009 were 1 higher than 2008 primarily due to both completed expansion projects and continued strong demand for distillate and ethanol volumes expansion projects completed since the end of 2008 increased the liquids terminals’ leasable capacity to 564 million barrels at the end of 2009 up 4 from a capacity of 542 million barrels at the end of 2008 in addition the overall liquids utilization capacity rate at the end of 2009 decreased by only 1 when compared to the prior yearend 

 

the increase in earnings in 2009 from the west region terminals was driven by incremental earnings from the north 40 and vancouver wharves terminals kmp completed construction and placed its north 40 terminal into service in the second quarter of 2008 the increase in earnings from the vancouver wharves terminal was chiefly due to higher liquids revenues due in part to expanded liquids facilities that began operating in april 2009 and to continued strong ship traffic during 2009 at the port metro vancouver 

 

the increase in earnings from the texas petroleum coke operations was driven by higher earnings realized from the port of houston port of beaumont and houston refining operations the combined earnings increase from these operations was driven by higher petroleum coke throughput and production volumes and by higher handling rates in 2009 the increase in volumes was due in part to a new petroleum coke customer contract that boosted volume at the port of houston bulk facility and in part to the negative impacts caused by hurricane ike in the third quarter of 2008 

 

the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization in 2009 compared to 2008 from terminals owned in both comparable years was partly offset by lower earnings from the midriver ohio valley and materials management terminals the decreases in earnings from these facilities were due primarily to lower importexport activity and lower overall business activity at various rail and terminal sites primarily involved in the handling and storage of steel and alloy products 

 

  

  

 

 

due to the economic downturn that intensified in the last half of 2008 kmp experienced significant yearoveryear volume and revenue declines at various owned andor operated terminal facilities in 2009 when compared to 2008 for the terminals—kmp segment combined bulk traffic tonnage decreased by 250 million tons 24 in 2009 versus 2008 and revenues from terminals owned in both years decreased by 807 million 7 however while the overall volume and revenue declines in 2009 were generally broadbased across all of the bulk terminals the rate of decline in 2009 compared to 2008 slowed during the year also beginning at the start of 2009 the segment undertook various actions to manage costs and increase productivity and for all terminals owned in both years combined operating expenses decreased 979 million 16 in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition to the effects from the declines in bulk tonnage volumes described above the expense reduction was generated by a combination of aggressive cost management actions related to operating expenses certain productivity initiatives at various terminal sites and yearoveryear declines in commodity and fuel costs 

 

kinder morgan canada—kmp 

 

 

 

 

the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment includes the operations of the trans mountain and jet fuel pipeline systems and kmp’s onethird ownership interest in the express crude oil pipeline system 

 

combined the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 112 million in 2009 and increased segment earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses by 04 million in 2008 following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment’s i earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses and ii operating revenues in both 2010 and 2009 when compared to the respective prior year 

 

year ended december 31 2010 versus year ended december 31 2009 

 

 

the increase in the kinder morgan canada—kmp business segment’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by higher earnings from the trans mountain pipeline system and kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system the overall 98 million 6 increase in trans mountain’s 

 

  

  

 

 

earnings in 2010 consisted of a 228 million 15 increase due to higher operating income revenues less operating expenses and a combined 130 million 373 decrease due to both lower income from foreign currency transactions included in nonoperating other income and higher income tax expenses 

 

the increase in operating income and related income tax expenses was driven by higher crude oil volumes moving across trans mountain’s marine dock located in port metro vancouver—system throughput volumes increased by 6 overall compared to 2009 the decrease in income from foreign currency transactions was primarily attributable to lower currency gains on trans mountain’s outstanding shortterm intercompany interest obligations payable in us dollars although the canadian dollar did strengthen during 2010 gains from the revaluation of usbased interest liabilities were lower in 2010 because the impact was not as favorable as in 2009 

 

the increase in earnings from kmp’s investment in the express pipeline system was largely due to a 55 million decrease in yearoveryear income tax expenses in 2010 and a 12 million increase in the interest income kmp earns from its longterm debt investment in express the drop in income tax expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was mainly due to a valuation allowance release on previously established deferred tax balances and the increase in interest income was due to favorable currency translation impacts in 2010 described above 

 

year ended december 31 2009 versus year ended december 31 2008 

 

 

the 181 million 13 increase in trans mountain’s earnings before depreciation depletion and amortization expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was driven primarily by a 261 million 13 increase in operating revenues and partly by higher net currency gains relative to 2008 the increase in revenues reflected higher pipeline transportation revenues due largely to an 18 increase in mainline delivery volumes resulting from both a significant increase in ship traffic during 2009 at port metro vancouver and the completion of the trans mountain pipeline anchor loop expansion project in october 2008 the overall increase in trans mountain’s earnings was partially offset by higher yearoveryear income tax expenses and lower income from allowances for capital funds used for pipeline system construction costs 

 

the increase in earnings from jet fuel in 2009 was driven by both higher pipeline transportation revenues and higher net currency gains included within “other net income” 

 

the lower earnings from express was primarily due to lower equity earning from kmp’s 33 13 ownership interest in the express pipeline system higher yearoveryear income tax expense and higher net currency losses included within “other net income” in 2009 

 

ngpl pipeco llc 

 

 

 

 

on february 15 2008 we sold an 80 ownership interest in its ngpl pipeco llc business segment to myria acquisition inc myria for approximately 59 billion as a result of the sale beginning february 15 2008 we account for our 20 ownership interest as an equity method investment we continue to operate ngpl pipeco llc’s assets pursuant to a 15year operating agreement 

 

  

  

 

 

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

2010 includes a noncash impairment charge of 4300 million following is information related to the decrease in ngpl pipeco llc’s net income and other measurements at the 100 ownership level which when multiplied by our 20 ownership interest equals the remaining decrease of 115 million 27 in our equity earnings for 2010 when compared to 2009 

 

for 2010 ngpl pipeco llc’s net income before impairment charges decreased by 574 million 27 from 2126 million for 2009 to 1552 million for 2010 results for 2010 relative to 2009 were negatively impacted by an 885 million reduction in gross margin which is total revenues less gas purchases and other costs of sales from 8769 million in 2009 to 7884 million in 2010 primarily resulting from reduced rates and volumes on transportation and storage services and a reduction in net fuel collections these reductions are partially attributable to the settlement of ngpl pipeco llc’s section 5 rate proceeding that became effective in the third quarter of 2010 see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and lower contracted rates and volumes on the system in 2010 than in 2009 in addition 2010 earnings were negatively impacted by i a 130 million increase in operating expenses due in part to increased pipeline system integrity management and testing programs and other pipeline operations costs and ii a 29 million net decrease in other pretax income these negative impacts were partially offset by a 470 million reduction in income tax expense principally due to i a reduction in pretax income and ii the inclusion in 2009 results of an increase in tax expense associated with a deferred tax liability adjustment due to an effective tax rate increase 

 

year ended december 31 2009 vs 2008 

 

the 873 million 67 decrease in segment earnings before dda between the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in the ngpl pipeco llc reportable segment was primarily due to the february 15 2008 sale of an 80 ownership interest in ngpl pipeco llc to myria acquisition inc as a result of the sale beginning february 15 2008 we account for our 20 ownership interest in ngpl pipeco llc as an equity method investment segment earnings before dda at the 100 asset ownership level were 897 million for the period from january 1 2008 to february 14 2008 and for the period february 15 2008 to december 31 2008 our equity earnings were 401 million 

 

ngpl pipeco llc’s net income at the 100 ownership level decreased by 178 million 77 from 2304 million in 2008 to 2126 million in 2009 results for 2009 relative to 2008 were negatively impacted by i a 218 million decrease in gross margin from 8987 million in 2008 to 8769 million in 2009 ii the inclusion in 2008 results of 56 million of net gains on sales of land iii a 27 million net decrease in other pretax income and iv an 87 million increase in income tax expense due to an increase in the effective tax rate applicable to state income taxes partially offset by a decrease in pretax earnings these negative impacts were partially offset by a 210 million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses due in part to lower costs for transmission system integrity management programs lower electric power costs and 2009 insurance recoveries related to hurricane ike the decrease in gross margin from 2008 to 2009 was principally attributable to i a 302 million reduction in gross profit from operational natural gas sales due largely to lower natural gas prices ii 210 million of charges in 2009 to reduce the carrying value of current storage gas inventories to reflect the reduced market price of natural gas and iii a 43 million net reduction in other miscellaneous gross profit items partially offset by a 337 million increase from natural gas transportation and storage services ngpl’s operational natural gas sales are primarily made possible by its collection of fuel inkind pursuant to its transportation tariffs and sale of storage cushion gas volumes 

 

power 

 

this segment consisted of our operation of a 550megawatt natural gasfired electric generation facility in michigan triton power which was sold on october 22 2010 the power segment also includes a 105megawatt natural gasfired power plant in snyder texas that generates electricity for the co 2 —kmp business segment’s sacroc operations the plant’s sole customer under a cost reimbursement agreement  due to triton power’s sale in future periods we will not report power as a separate business segment 

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2010 vs 2009 

 

power’s segment earnings before dda decreased by 07 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale of triton power on october 22 2010 

 

year ended december 31 2009 vs 2008 

 

power’s segment earnings before dda decreased by 09 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower operating fees at the snyder plant which we operate on behalf of the co 2 —kmp business segment

items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses unallocable interest income and income tax expense interest expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employeerelated expenses payroll taxes insurance office supplies and rentals unallocated litigation and environmental expenses and shared corporate services—including accounting information technology human resources and legal services 

 

for 2010 the certain items described in footnote c to the table above increased kmp’s general and administrative expenses by 47 million when compared with 2009 the remaining 402 million 12 yeartoyear increase in expenses included increases of i 219 million from higher employee benefit and payroll tax expenses ii 57 million from higher overall corporate insurance expenses and iii 52 million from higher unallocated legal expenses 

 

the increase in kmp’s benefit and payroll tax expenses was mainly due to the overall variability in yearoveryear health and medical costs higher wage rates and a larger yearoveryear labor force the increases in kmp’s insurance expenses were primarily due to higher expense accruals in 2010 related to yearoveryear increases in commercial property and liability insurance costs and partly due to incremental premium taxes the increase in legal expenses was primarily due to higher outside legal services in 2010 

 

for 2010 the certain items described in footnote a to the table above increased the kmi general and administrative expenses by 2000 million for 2010 when compared to 2009 the remaining 132 million 31 yearoveryear increase included a 51 million increase in going private transaction litigation expenses and a 75 million increase in other legal expenses 

 

we report our interest expense as “net” meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income and capitalized interest from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount and after taking into effect the certain items described in footnote d to the table above the combined unallocable interest expense net of interest income increased 720 million 13 in 2010 when compared to 2009 the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher average kmp debt balances in 2010 and partly offset by lower effective interest rates average kmp borrowings for 2010 increased 16 when compared to 2009 largely due to the capital expenditures investment contributions and external business acquisitions kmp has made since last year for more information on kmp’s capital expenditures capital contributions and acquisition expenditures see “liquidity and capital resources” the weighted average interest rate on kmp’s borrowings decreased 5 in 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease was due primarily to a general drop in variable interest rates since the beginning of 2009 including decreases in the variable interest rate kmp paid on the borrowings made under its revolving bank credit facility and commercial paper program 

 

we use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to the longterm fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt and in periods of falling interest rates these swaps result in periodtoperiod decreases in interest expense 

 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 20 or approximately 34 when excluding the 750 million of senior notes that matured on january 5 2011 of kinder morgan kansas incs and 47 of kmp’s debt balances of 36238 million and 115461 million respectively excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements were subject to variable interest rates—either as shortterm or longterm variable rate debt obligations or as longterm fixedrate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps for more information on our interest rate swaps see note 13 “risk management—interest rate risk management” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries primarily kmp which are not held by us increased 628 million 23 for 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase is primarily due to a reduction in the incentive distribution we received from kmp due to a kmp interim capital transaction see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

year ended december 31 2009 vs 2008 

 

consolidated general and administrative expense increased 205 million 58 in 2009 compared to 2008 the 324 million 109 increase in kmp’s general and administrative expense includes 158 million from higher employee benefit and payroll tax expenses in 2009 and 107 million due to fewer overhead expenses meeting the criteria 

  

  

 

 

 

for capitalization kmi’s general and administrative expense which decreased 119 million 218 includes an 84 million decrease in legal costs for 2009 as compared to 2008 

 

the 399 million 64 decrease in interest and other net for 2009 relative to 2008 was primarily due from using 59 billion of proceeds received from the sale of an 80 ownership interest in ngpl pipeco llc to pay down debt in early 2008 this reduction in our interest expense was partially offset by higher interest expense from increased debt balances at kmp required to support its capital expansion programs 

 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries primarily kmp which are not held by us decreased 1180 million in 2009 298 when compared to 2008 the decrease in our noncontrolling interests was primarily due to our lower net income in 2009 from our consolidated subsidiaries

the 1590 million decrease in tax expense to 1676 million for 2010 is primarily due to i a decrease in pretax income due to the going private transaction litigation settlement see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies ― going private litigation” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report ii a decrease in pretax income due to a lower distribution from kmp for the third quarter of 2010 as a result of an interim capital transaction see note 16 “litigation environmental and other contingencies ― federal energy regulatory commission proceedings ― sfpp” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report iii a decrease in pretax income due to a 4300 million impairment of our investment in ngpl pipeco llc see note 6 “investments ―ngpl ” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report iv lower state income taxes v an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities related to certain kinder morgan canada subsidiaries vi adjustments to the deferred tax liability related to our investments in ngpl triton power and our employee benefit trust vii lower adjustments in 2010 to trueup our book tax provision to the federal and state tax returns filed and viii changes in nondeductible goodwill related to our investment in kmp the decrease is partially offset by i a lower dividendsreceived deduction relative to lower dividends received from our 20 ownership interest in ngpl ii the impact on deferred taxes of an increase in our state tax rate iii adjustments to our reserve for uncertain tax positions and iv an adjustment to the deferred tax liability related to our investment in kmr as discussed following 

 

as explained in our dividend policy and distributions discussion below after our initial public offering we intend periodically to sell the kmr shares we receive as distributions from kmr since we no longer expect to recover our investment in kmr in a taxfree manner a deferred tax liability was recorded resulting in a 795 million increase to income tax expense in 2010 

 

year ended december 31 2009 vs 2008 

 

the 223 million increase in tax expense to 3266 million for 2009 as compared to 3043 million for 2008 is primarily due to i certain one–time noncash deferred tax expenses related to a the restructuring of certain subsidiaries of kinder morgan canada—kmp and us b the treatment of trans mountain pipeline inc a subsidiary of kinder morgan canada—kmp as a non–regulated entity c the impact on deferred taxes of a decrease in kinder morgan canada—kmp’s canadian tax rate in 2008 and ii higher state income taxes the increase is partially offset by i the tax impact on lower pretax earnings of kmr and kmp’s domestic corporate subsidiaries ii an increase in nondeductible goodwill related to our investment in kmp iii the impact on deferred taxes of a decrease in our state tax rate v lower additions in 2009 to our reserve for uncertain tax provisions iv lower adjustments in 2009 to trueup our book tax provision to the federal and state tax returns filed and vi small outofperiod adjustments related to current and deferred taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

 

general 

 

as of december 31 2010 we believe our balance sheet and liquidity positions remained strong cash and cash equivalents on hand at december 31 2010 was 5024 million we believe that we and our subsidiaries and investments including kmp have liquidity and access to financial resources as demonstrated through our results for the year ended 

  

  

 

 

december 31 2010 as discussed below sufficient to meet future requirements for working capital debt repayment and apital expenditures associated with existing and future expansion projects along with payment of our dividends and kmp’s distributions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the primary cash requirements for us and our subsidiaries in addition to normal operating expenses are for debt service sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset expansion capital expenditures kmp’s quarterly distributions to its public common unitholders and our dividends to our shareholders our cash requirements continue to be met through cash from our operations kmp’s borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility kmp’s issuance of longterm notes or additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional kmp’s iunits by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of additional kmr shares borrowings under kinder morgan kansas inc’s secured revolving bank credit facility and kinder morgan kansas inc’s issuance of longterm senior notes 

 

credit ratings and capital market liquidity 

 

as part of kmps financial strategy it tries to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating which involves among other things the issuance of additional kmp limited partner units in connection with its acquisitions and expansion activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios currently kmp’s longterm corporate debt credit rating is bbb stable baa2 negative and bbb stable at standard  poor’s ratings services moody’s investors service inc and fitch inc respectively 

 

on february 23 2011 moodys investor services revised its outlook on kmps shortterm credit rating to stable from negative and upgraded kmp’s short term debt rating to prime 2 p2 on february 25 2010 standard  poor’s revised its outlook on kmp’s longterm credit rating to stable from negative affirmed kmp’s longterm credit rating at bbb and raised kmp’s shortterm credit rating to a2 from a3 the rating agency’s revisions reflected its expectations that kmp’s financial profile will improve due to lower guaranteed debt obligations and higher expected cash flows associated with the completion and startup of the rockies express midcontinent express and kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline systems as a result of this upward revision to kmp’s shortterm rating kmp currently has additional access to the commercial paper market that was not available prior to this rating change kmp expects that its shortterm liquidity needs will be met through borrowings made under its bank credit facility and its commercial paper program nevertheless kmp’s ability to satisfy its financing requirements or fund its planned capital expenditures will depend upon its future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy and terminals industries and other financial and business factors some of which are beyond its control 

 

additionally some of kmp’s customers are experiencing or may experience in the future severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness these financial problems may arise from current global economic conditions changes in commodity prices or otherwise kmp has been and is working to implement to the extent allowable under applicable contracts tariffs and regulations prepayments and other security requirements such as letters of credit to enhance its credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers kmp cannot provide assurance that one or more of its current or future financially distressed customers will not default on its obligations to it or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on its business financial position future results of operations or future cash flows however kmp believes it has provided adequate allowance for such customers 

 

 

  

  

 

 

  

shortterm liquidity 

  

our principal sources of shortterm liquidity are kinder morgan kansas inc’s revolving bank credit facility kmp’s revolving bank credit facility and cash provided by operations the bank credit facilities can be used for the respective entity’s general corporate or partnership purposes and kmp’s facility can be used as a backup for its commercial paper program kmp’s facility can be amended to allow for borrowings up to 23 billion we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to the bank credit facilities discussed above in “—general” and currently we believe our liquidity to be adequate 

 

the following represents the revolving credit facilities that were available to kinder morgan kansas inc and its subsidiary kmp shortterm debt outstanding under the credit facilities including commercial paper borrowings and available borrowing capacity under the facilities after deducting i outstanding letters of credit and ii outstanding borrowings under kinder morgan kansas inc’s credit facility and kmp’s commercial paper program 

 

 

our total balance of shortterm debt as of december 31 2010 was 20133 million primarily consisting of i 7500 million in principal amount of kinder morgan kansas inc’s 535 series senior notes that matured on january 5 2011 ii 7000 million in principal amount of kmp’s 675 senior notes that mature march 15 2011 and iii 5221 million of commercial paper under kmp’s bank credit facility as of december 31 2009 our total balance of shortterm debt was 7687 million kinder morgan kansas inc and kmp intend to refinance current shortterm debt and any additional shortterm debt incurred during the remainder of the year through a combination of longterm debt commercial paper andor bank credit facility borrowings kmp also can issue equity to refinance its current shortterm debt 

 

we had working capital deficits current assets minus current liabilities of 18572 million as of december 31 2010 and 9389 million as of december 31 2009 the unfavorable change from 2009 was primarily due to i 7500 million in principal amount of kinder morgan kansas inc’s 535 senior notes that matured on january 5 2011 being reclassified from longterm to shortterm debt and ii 7000 million in principal amount of kmp’s 675 senior notes due march 15 2011 being reclassified from longterm to shortterm debt generally our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our or our subsidiaries’ debt or equity issuances as a result our working capital balance could return to a surplus in future periods a working capital deficit is not unusual for us or for other companies similar in size and scope to us and we believe that our working capital deficit does not indicate a lack of liquidity as we continue to maintain adequate current assets and committed lines of credit to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due 

 

longterm financing 

 

from time to time kinder morgan kansas inc or kmp issue longterm debt securities often referred to as senior notes all of the senior notes of kinder morgan kansas inc or kmp issued to date other than those issued by kmp’s subsidiaries and its operating partnerships generally have very similar terms except for interest rates maturity dates and prepayment premiums all of these outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of the other senior debt obligations however a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of kmp’s operating partnerships and subsidiaries our and kmp’s fixed rate senior notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a makewhole premium for additional information on these debt securities and on the 2010 and 2009 debt related transactions including issuances of senior notes see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

  

  

 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our net carrying value of the various series of kinder morgan kansas inc and its subsidiaries’ excluding kmp and its subsidiaries’ longterm debt including the current portion and excluding the value of interest rate swaps was 36238 million and 28733 million respectively the amount outstanding at december 31 2010 includes the 7500 million of 535 senior notes paid on january 5 2011 see note 8 to our consolidated financial s tatements included elsewhere in this report as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our net carrying value including purchase accounting adjustments of the various series of kmp and its subsidiaries’ various longterm borrowings including the current portion and excluding the value of interest rate swaps was 110240 million and 103040 million respectively to date our debt balances have not adversely affected our operations our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness based on our historical record we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives 

 

we and our subsidiaries including kmp are subject however to conditions in the equity and debt markets and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for equity andor longterm senior notes in the future if we were unable or unwilling to access the equity markets we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures andor potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our subsidiaries’ credit ratings furthermore our subsidiaries’ ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by their respective credit ratings see “—credit ratings and capital market liquidity” above for a discussion of kmp’s credit ratings 

 

capital expenditures 

 

we define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset and for the year ended december 31 2010 our sustaining capital expenditures were 1808 million including 1792 million associated with kmp this amount included 02 million for kmp’s proportionate share of the sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc ii midcontinent express pipeline llc iii kinderhawk field services llc iv cypress interstate pipeline llc and v fayetteville express pipeline llc for the year ended december 31 2009 our sustaining capital expenditures totaled 1727 million including 1720 million associated with kmp and 02 million for kmp’s proportionate share of rockies express’ sustaining capital expenditures our forecasted expenditures for 2011 for sustaining capital expenditures are approximately 2255 million including 69 million for kmp’s proportionate shares of rockies express midcontinent express kinderhawk cypress and fayetteville express 

 

generally we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations in addition to utilizing cash generated from their own operations both rockies express and midcontinent express can each fund their own cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under their own credit facilities issuing their own longterm notes or with proceeds from contributions received from their member owners similarly kinderhawk field services can fund its cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures with cash generated from its own operations through borrowings under its own credit facility or with proceeds from contributions received from its two member owners kmp has no contingent debt obligation with respect to either rockies express pipeline llc or kinderhawk field services llc however kmp guarantees both 50 of midcontinent express pipeline llc’s bank credit facility borrowings and 50 of fayetteville express pipeline llc’s bank credit facility borrowings for information on our contingent debt obligations see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

all of our capital expenditures with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures are classified as discretionary our discretionary capital expenditures for each of the two years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 were 8219 million and 11518 million respectively and were associated entirely with kmp the yeartoyear decrease in discretionary capital expenditures was largely due to the higher investment undertaken in 2009 to construct kmp’s kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipeline system and to expand and improve our products pipelines—kmp and terminals—kmp business segments generally kmp initially funds its discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under its bank credit facility or its commercial paper program until the amount borrowed is of sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt equity or both kmp has forecasted 7956 million for discretionary capital expenditures in its 2011 budget this amount does not include forecasted capital contributions to its equity investees or forecasted expenditures for asset acquisitions 

 

capital contributions 

 

in addition to its discretionary capital expenditures kmp contributed a combined 2993 million to its equity investees in 2010 in 2009 kmp made equity investment contributions of 20518 million the decrease in contributions in 2010 was driven by the incremental contributions kmp made in 2009 to rockies express pipeline llc 

  

  

 

 

midcontinent express pipeline llc and fayetteville express pipeline llc all three reported as investments on our balance sheet and accounted for under the equity method of accounting combined kmp contributed 20408 million in 2009 to partially fund i their respective rockies express midcontinent express and fayetteville express pipeline construction andor preconstruction costs and ii the repayment of senior notes by rockies express in august 2009 

  

kmp’s 2010 contributions primarily consisted of a combined 2165 million contributed to rockies express pipeline llc and midcontinent express pipeline llc fayetteville express pipeline llc funded its 2010 pipeline construction costs with borrowings under its own 11 billion unsecured revolving bank credit facility that is due in may 2012 generally kmp funds its equity investment contributions through borrowings under its bank credit facility or its commercial paper program to the extent these sources of funding are not sufficient kmp generally funds additional amounts through the issuance of longterm notes or common units for cash 

 

capital requirements for recent transactions 

 

for each of the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 kmp’s net cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled   12132 million and 3289 million respectively kmp’s 2010 cash outlays for strategic business acquisitions primarily consisted of i 9214 million for a 50 equity ownership interest in petrohawk energy corporation’s natural gas gathering and treating business now kinderhawk field services llc ii 1143 million for three unit train ethanol handling terminals acquired from us development group llc and iii 970 million for terminal assets and investments acquired from slay industries with the exception of the terminal assets acquired from us development group llc which was partially acquired by the issuance of additional common units kmp utilized its commercial paper program to fund its 2010 acquisitions and then reduced its shortterm borrowings with the proceeds from its 2010 equity issuances and its may 2010 issuance of longterm senior notes including both the value of common units kmp issued as consideration in the acquisition of assets and the cash related to acquisitions that it placed in escrow as of december 31 2010 kmp’s outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled 13449 million in 2010 

 

kmp’s cash payments for acquired assets and investments in 2009 included 2653 million for its acquisition of the natural gas treating business from crosstex energy lp and crosstex energy inc and 360 million for its 40 membership interest in endeavor gathering llc kmp utilized its bank credit facility to fund its significant 2009 acquisitions and then reduced its shortterm borrowings with the proceeds from its 2009 issuances of common units and senior notes all of kmp’s significant 2010 and 2009 acquisitions are discussed further in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

net cash used in investing activities was 22871 million in 2010 versus 34775 million in 2009 the net increase in cash of 11904 million in investing activities in the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the respective 2009 period was primarily attributable to

net cash provided by financing activities was 7106 million in 2010 versus 19310 million in 2009 the net decrease of 12204 million in cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the respective 2009 period was primarily attributable to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dividend policy and distributions 

 

our dividend policy set forth in our shareholders agreement provides subject to applicable law that we will pay quarterly cash dividends on all classes of our capital stock equal to the cash we receive from our subsidiaries and other sources less any cash disbursements and reserves established by a majority vote of our board of directors including for general and administrative expenses interest and cash taxes the division of our dividends among our classes of capital stock will be in accordance with our charter our board of directors may declare dividends by a majority vote in accordance with our dividend policy pursuant to our bylaws this policy reflects our judgment that our stockholders would be better served if we distributed to them a substantial portion of our cash as a result we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities including acquisitions 

 

as presented in the table at the end of this section in 2010 we had cash available to pay distributions of 654 million 763 million adjusting for the interim capital transaction in 2011 we expect to have cash available to pay dividends of 820 million and we expect to pay quarterly dividends of 029 per share on our common stock or 205 million per quarter we anticipate that the first quarterly dividend on the common stock offered after our february 2011 initial public offering will be paid in may 2011 and that such dividend will be prorated for the portion of the first quarter of 2011 that we are public prior to the initial public offering we paid a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 and for the portion of 

  

  

 

 

the first quarter of 2011 that we were not public this dividend was paid only to our existing investors as further discussed below dividends on our investor retained stock generally will be paid at the same time as dividends on our common stock and will be based on the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which our investor retained stock is convertible on the record date for the applicable dividend 

  

the portion of our dividends payable on the three classes of our investor retained stock may vary among those classes but the variations will not affect the dividends we pay on our common stock since the total number of shares of common stock into which our outstanding investor retained stock can convert in the aggregate was fixed on the closing of our initial public offering on february 16 2011 as of that date investor retained stock was convertible into a fixed aggregate of 597213410 shares of our common stock which represent 845 of our common stock on a fullyconverted basis subsequent to our initial public offering any conversion of our investor retained stock into our common stock will reduce on a one for one basis the number of common shares into which our investor retained stock can convert such that the number of shares on a fully converted basis is the same before and after the conversion of our investor retained stock 

 

our board of directors may amend revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason which would require a supermajority board approval while the sponsor investors consisting of investment funds advised by or affiliated with goldman sachs  co highstar capital lp the carlyle group and riverstone holdings llc maintain prescribed ownership thresholds during that time supermajority approval would also be required to declare and pay any dividends that are not in accordance with our dividend policy there is nothing in our dividend policy or our governing documents that prohibits us from borrowing to pay dividends the actual amount of dividends to be paid on our capital stock will depend on many factors including our financial condition and results of operations liquidity requirements market opportunities our capital requirements legal regulatory and contractual constraints tax laws and other factors distributions we receive from kmp are our most significant source of our cash available to pay dividends including the value of additional kmr shares we receive on the approximately 13 million shares we own we intend periodically to sell the kmr shares we receive as distributions to generate cash 

 

on february 11 2011 kinder morgan inc’s board of directors declared and paid a dividend to our existing investors of 2458 million with respect to the period for which we were not public this consisted of 2050 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 1048 million for the first 46 days of 2011 representing the portion of the first quarter of 2011 that we were not public less a one time adjustment of 640 million in available earnings and profits reserved for the after tax cost of onetime cash bonuses and premium pay in an aggregate amount of approximately 100 million to certain of our nonexecutive management employees we expect to pay such bonuses pursuant to the shareholders’ agreement in the second quarter of 2011 the payment of any bonuses to holders of our class b shares or class c shares is subject to supermajority approval of our board of directors in accordance with our bylaws

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

generally our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading” our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forwardlooking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

 

energy commodity market risk 

 

primarily through our subsidiary kmp we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks such as weatherrelated risk in the ordinary course of business however we take steps to hedge or limit our exposure to these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream stated another way we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil the derivative contracts kmp uses include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and overthecounter markets including but not limited to futures and options contracts fixed price swaps and basis swaps 

 

fundamentally our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position or anticipated position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change for example as sellers of crude oil and natural gas kmp often enters into fixed price swaps andor futures contracts to guarantee or lockin the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery thereby directly offsetting any change in prices either positive or negative a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 

 

our policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings while it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard  poor’s ratings services 

 

 

as discussed above the principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide kmp increased certainty with regard to its operating cash flows and helps it undertake further capital improvement projects attain budget results and meet distribution targets to its partners we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions as opposed to the value of an asset liability or firm commitment and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 

 

in accounting for cash flow hedges gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income outside “net income” reported in our consolidated statements of income but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income that is for cash flow hedges all effective components of the derivative contracts’ gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss pending occurrence of the expected transaction other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included within “accumulated other comprehensive loss” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are included within 

 

  

  

 

 

“noncontrolling interests” and are not included in our net income thus in highly effective cash flow hedges where there is no ineffectiveness other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

 

all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss in addition when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and “noncontrolling interests” and are transferred to the income statement as well effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales depreciation interest expense etc for more information on our other comprehensive income loss and our “accumulated other comprehensive loss” see notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

 

we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a valueatrisk model valueatrisk is a statistical measure estimating the probability of portfolio losses over a given holding period within a certain level of statistical confidence we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a quarterly basis our valueatrisk computations utilize a confidence level of 977 for the resultant price movement and we choose a holding period of one day for the calculation the confidence level used means that there is a 977 probability that the marktomarket losses for a single day will not exceed the valueatrisk number presented for each of the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 our valueatrisk reached a high of 69 million and 104 million respectively and a low of 25 million and 26 million respectively valueatrisk as of december 31 2010 was 25 million and averaged 46 million for 2010 valueatrisk as of december 31 2009 was 101 million and averaged 76 million for 2009 

 

our calculated valueatrisk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on the combined portfolio of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts fixed price swaps basis swaps and overthecounter options and corresponding physical commodities assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates operating exposures and the timing thereof as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 

 

in addition as discussed above kmp enters into its derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of its business activities and therefore both in the valueatrisk calculation and in reality the change in the market value of the derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions for more information on our energy commodity risk management activities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 

 

for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows generally there is not an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt included in the accompanying balance sheets until such debt is required to be refinanced 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the carrying values of the fixed rate debt included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets were 145591 million and 130834 million respectively these amounts compare to as of december 31 2010 and 2009 fair values of 155183 million and 136762 million respectively fair values were determined using quoted market prices where applicable or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for 2010 and 2009 would result in changes of approximately   5303 million and 5035 million respectively in the fair values of these instruments the carrying value and fair value of the variable rate debt including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following was 5961 million and 5589 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

  

  

 

 

as of december 31 2010 kinder morgan kansas inc and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of 7250 million and 48 billion respectively as of december 31 2009 kinder morgan kansas inc and kmp were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of 7250 million and 52 billion respectively an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal which is called the notional principal amount normally at each payment or settlement date the party who owes more pays the net amount so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal a hypothetical 10 change of the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately 45 basis points in 2010 when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 and 2009 including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above would result in changes of approximately 274 million and 302 million respectively in our 2010 and 2009 annual pretax earnings 

 

interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to longterm fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt since the fair value of fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest swap agreements are entered into to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt included our the accompanying balance sheets due to market rate changes 

 

as of both december 31 2010 and 2009 all of kinder morgan kansas inc’s and kmp’s interest rate swap agreements represented fixedforvariable rate swaps where each agreed to pay its counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount comprised of principal amounts from various series of its longterm fixed rate senior notes in exchange the counterparties agreed to pay a fixed rate of interest thereby allowing fixed rate liabilities to transform into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 

 

we monitor the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time through our subsidiaries may alter that mix by for example refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements in general kmp attempts to maintain an overall target mix of approximately 50 fixed rate debt and 50 of variable rate debt and typically kinder morgan kansas inc excluding kmp targets well below that level for variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 approximately 20 of kinder morgan kansas inc’s debt excluding that of kmp is variable rate debt 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our cash and investment portfolio included 82 million and 132 million respectively in fixedincome debt securities these amounts are included in “investments” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at each reporting date and are not material to our consolidated balance sheets

stock compensation plan for nonemployee directors 

 

in connection with our initial public offering we have adopted the stock compensation plan for nonemployee directors in which our newlyappointed independent directors will participate none of the 11 directors nominated by richard d kinder or the sponsor investors will participate in the plan the following is a summary of the plan the plan is administered by our compensation committee and our board has sole discretion to terminate the plan at any time the primary purpose of this plan is to promote our interests and the interests of our stockholders by aligning the compensation of the nonemployee members of our board of directors with stockholders’ interests 

 

the plan recognizes that the compensation to be paid to each nonemployee director is fixed by our board generally annually and that the compensation is payable in cash pursuant to the plan in lieu of receiving some or all of the cash compensation each nonemployee director who was not nominated by richard d kinder or one of the sponsor investors referred to as ‘‘eligible directors’’ may elect to receive shares of common stock each election will be generally at or around the first board meeting in january of each calendar year and will be effective for the entire calendar year an eligible director may make a new election each calendar year the total number of shares of common stock authorized under the plan is 250000 

 

each annual election to receive shares of common stock will be evidenced by an agreement between us and each eligible director that will contain the terms and conditions of each award shares issued under the plan pursuant to an election may be subject to forfeiture restrictions that lapse on the earlier of the director’s death or the date set forth in the agreement which will be no later than the end of the calendar year to which the cash compensation relates until the forfeiture restrictions lapse shares issued under the plan may not be sold assigned transferred exchanged or pledged by an eligible director in the event a director’s service as a director is terminated prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions for any reason other than death or the director’s failure to be elected as a director at a shareholders meeting at which the director is considered for election the director will for no consideration forfeit to us all shares to the extent then subject to the forfeiture restrictions if prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions the director is not elected as a director at a shareholders meeting at which the director is considered for election the forfeiture restrictions will lapse with respect to fifty percent 50 of the director’s shares then subject to such restrictions and the director will for no consideration forfeit to us the remaining shares shares with respect to which forfeiture restrictions have lapsed will cease to be subject to any forfeiture restrictions and we will provide the eligible director a certificate representing the shares as to which the forfeiture restrictions have lapsed in addition each eligible director will have the right to receive dividends with respect to the shares awarded to him under the plan to be paid as described below to vote such shares and to enjoy all other common stockholder rights including during the period prior to the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions 

 

the number of shares to be issued to an eligible director electing to receive any portion of the cash compensation in the form of shares will equal the amount of such cash compensation elected to be paid in the form of shares divided by the closing price of the common stock on the new york stock exchange on the day the cash compensation is awarded such price the fair market value rounded up to the nearest ten shares an eligible director electing to receive any portion of the cash compensation in the form of shares will receive cash equal to the difference between 1 the total cash compensation awarded to such director and 2 the number of shares to be issued to such director multiplied by the fair market value of a share this cash payment will be payable in four equal installments generally around march 31 june 30 september 30 and december 31 of the calendar year in which such cash compensation is awarded provided that the installment payments will be adjusted to include dividends with respect to the shares during a period in which the shares are subject to forfeiture restrictions 

 




 item 11 executive compensation 

 

our executive officers have not received longterm compensation for serving in such capacities for kmi other than the receipt of class a1 units and class b units in the going private transaction which converted into the class c shares and class b shares respectively upon our initial public offering in addition to information regarding such compensation the following sets forth information regarding compensation earned by awarded to or paid to kmi’s executive officers in their capacities as executive officers of kmi’s subsidiaries or its affiliates including kmp collectively referred to as the ‘‘kinder morgan affiliated entities’’ for the periods presented kmi’s executive officers also serve in the same capacities as executive officers of kinder morgan kansas inc kinder morgan gp inc and kmr in this section ‘‘we’’ ‘‘our’’ or ‘‘us’’ refers to kmi and where appropriate kinder morgan kansas inc kinder morgan gp inc kmp and kmr 

 

  

  

 

  

prior to the going private transaction kinder morgan kansas inc’s board of directors had a compensation committee that complied with the requirements of the new york stock exchange following the going private transaction and prior to the completion of our initial public offering neither kmi’s board nor kinder morgan kansas inc’s board had a separately designated compensation committee richard d kinder as our chief manager made compensation decisions with respect to kinder morgan kansas inc’s executive officers references in this section to ‘‘our compensation committee’’ mean for the periods prior to the going private transaction kinder morgan kansas inc’s thenexisting compensation committee and for the period from june 1 2007 through february 11 2011 mr kinder as our chief manager and after february 11 2011 mssrs fayez sarofim r baran tekkora and glenn a youngkin the compensation committee of the board of directors of kmr which committee is composed of three independent directors determines the compensation to be paid by kmp to kmr’s and kinder morgan gp inc’s executive officers as described below kmr’s compensation committee is aware of the compensation paid to such officers by entities such as kinder morgan kansas inc but makes its compensation determinations at its sole discretion 

 

as long as the sponsor investors can nominate at least five directors to our board of directors under our bylaws many compensation decisions also will be subject to supermajority board approval therefore our compensation committee will not have sole discretion with respect to these decisions 

 

compensation discussion and analysis 

 

program objectives 

 

we seek to attract and retain executives who will help us achieve our primary business strategy objective of growing the value of our portfolio of businesses for the benefit of our shareholders to help accomplish this goal we have designed an executive compensation program that rewards individuals with competitive compensation that consists of a mix of cash benefit plans and longterm compensation with a majority of executive compensation tied to the “at risk” portions of the annual cash bonus 

 

the key objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract motivate and retain executives who will advance our overall business strategies and objectives to create and return value to our shareholders we believe that an effective executive compensation program should link total compensation to financial performance and to the attainment of short and longterm strategic operational and financial objectives we also believe it should provide competitive total compensation opportunities at a reasonable cost in designing our executive compensation program we have recognized that our executives have a much greater portion of their overall compensation atrisk than do our other employees consequently we have tried to establish the atrisk portions of our executive total compensation at levels that recognize their much increased level of responsibility and their ability to influence business results 

 

our executive compensation program is principally composed of the following two elements i base cash salary and ii possible annual cash bonus reflected in the summary compensation table below as nonequity incentive plan compensation we pay our executive officers a base salary not to exceed 300000 which we believe is below annual base salaries for comparable positions in the marketplace in addition we believe that the compensation of our chief executive officer chief financial officer and the executives named in the summary compensation table below collectively referred to in this item 11 as our named executive officers should be directly and materially tied to the financial performance of us and kmp and should be aligned with the interests of our shareholders therefore the majority of our named executive officers’ compensation is allocated to the “at risk” portion of our compensation program—the annual cash bonus accordingly for 2010 our executive compensation was weighted toward the cash bonus payable on the basis of the achievement of i a free cash flow target described more fully below by us and ii a cash distribution per common unit target by kmp 

 

our compensation is determined independently without the use of any compensation surveys nevertheless we annually compare our executive compensation components with market information consisting of thirdparty surveys in which we participate the surveys we use in reviewing our executive compensation consist of the towers executive survey in which approximately 300 to 400 companies participate the hewitt executive survey in which approximately 400 companies participate and the natural gas transmission industries survey in which companies in the natural gas industry participate the purpose of this comparison is to ensure that our total compensation package operates effectively remains both reasonable and competitive with the energy industry and is generally comparable to the compensation offered by companies of similar size and scope as us we also keep abreast of current trends developments and emerging issues in executive compensation and if appropriate will obtain advice and assistance from outside legal compensation or other advisors 

 

  

  

 

  

we have endeavored to design our executive compensation program and practices with appropriate consideration of all tax accounting legal and regulatory requirements section 162m of the internal revenue code limits the deductibility of certain compensation for executive officers to 10 million of compensation per year however if specified conditions are met certain compensation may be excluded from consideration of the 10 million limit since the bonuses paid to our executive officers were paid under our annual incentive plan as a result of reaching designated financial targets established by richard d kinder and kmr’s compensation committee we expect that all compensation paid to our executives would qualify for deductibility under federal income tax rules though we are advised that limited partnerships such as kmp and private companies such as us prior to our initial public offering are not subject to section 162m we and kmp have chosen to generally operate as if this code section does apply to us and kmp as a measure of appropriate governance 

 

behaviors designed to reward 

 

our executive compensation program is designed to reward individuals for advancing our business strategies and the interests of our stakeholders and we prohibit engaging in any detrimental activities such as performing services for a competitor disclosing confidential information or violating appropriate business conduct standards each executive is held accountable to uphold and comply with company guidelines which require the individual to maintain a discriminationfree workplace to comply with orders of regulatory bodies and to maintain high standards of operating safety and environmental protection 

 

unlike many companies we have no executive perquisites supplemental executive retirement nonqualified supplemental defined benefitcontribution deferred compensation or split dollar life insurance programs for our executive officers we have no executive company cars or executive car allowances nor do we pay for financial planning services additionally we do not own any corporate aircraft and we do not pay for executives to fly first class we believe that this area of our existing executive compensation package is below competitive levels for comparable companies however we have no current plans to change our policy of not offering such executive benefits or perquisite programs 

 

we do not have employment agreements other than with richard d kinder or change of control agreements with our executive officers although our class b shares held by our executive officers will fully vest upon a change of control in connection with our initial public offering one of our affiliated companies entered into severance agreements with eleven of our and our subsidiaries’ executive officers see “—other compensation—other potential postemployment benefits” 

 

at his request richard d kinder receives 1 of base salary per year from us additionally mr kinder has requested that he receive no annual bonus or other compensation from us or any of our affiliates other than our class b unit awards that he received in 2007 in connection with the goingprivate transaction mr kinder does not have any deferred compensation supplemental retirement or any other special benefit compensation or perquisite arrangement with us and each year mr kinder reimburses us for his portion of health care premiums and parking expenses 

 

elements of compensation 

 

as outlined above our executive compensation program is principally composed of the following two elements i a base cash salary and ii a possible annual cash bonus with respect to our named executive officers other than our chief executive officer kmr’s compensation committee and richard d kinder review and approve annually the financial goals and objectives of both kmp and us that are relevant to the compensation of our named executive officers 

 

kmr’s compensation committee solicits information from richard d kinder and james e street vice president human resources and administration with respect to the performance of c park shaper president and steven j kean executive vice president and chief operating officer similarly the compensation committee solicits information from messrs kinder shaper kean and street with respect to the performance of the other named executive officers the compensation committee also obtains information from mr street with respect to compensation of comparable positions of responsibility at comparable companies all of this information is taken into account by the compensation committee which makes final determinations regarding compensation of the named executive officers no named executive officer reviews his or her own performance or approves his or her own compensation 

 

additionally if any of our and kinder morgan kansas inc’s executive officers is also an executive officer of kinder morgan gp inc or kmr the compensation determination or recommendation i may be with respect to the aggregate compensation to be received by such officer from us kinder morgan kansas inc kmr and kinder morgan gp inc that is to be allocated among them or alternatively ii may be with respect to the compensation to be received by such executive officers from us kinder morgan kansas inc kmr or kinder morgan gp inc as the case may be in which 

  

  

 

case such compensation will be allocated among us and kinder morgan kansas inc on the one hand and kmr and kinder morgan gp inc on the other 

 

base salary 

 

base salary is paid in cash the base salary cap for our executive officers with the exception of our chairman and chief executive officer who receives 1 of base salary per year as described above is an annual amount not to exceed 300000 prior to october 2008 the salary cap was 200000 per year generally we believe that our executive officers’ base salaries are below base salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at companies of comparable size and scope based upon independent salary surveys in which we participate 

 

possible annual cash bonus nonequity cash incentive 

 

for the 2009 and 2008 bonus years our possible annual cash bonuses were provided for under our annual incentive plan which became effective january 18 2005 for the 2010 bonus year kinder morgan kansas inc’s board of directors approved a new annual incentive plan referred to in this item 11 as the plan mirroring the previous plan 

 

the overall purpose of the plan is to increase our executive officers’ and our employees’ personal stake in the continued success of us and kmp by providing to them additional incentives through the possible payment of annual cash bonuses under the plan a budget amount is established for annual cash bonuses at the beginning of each year that may be paid to our executive officers and other employees depending on whether we and our subsidiaries including kmp meet certain financial performance objectives as discussed below the amount included in our budget for bonuses is not allocated between our executive officers and nonexecutive officers assuming the financial performance objectives are met the budgeted pool of bonus dollars is further assessed and potentially increased if we exceed the financial performance objectives the budget for bonuses also may be adjusted upward or downward based on our overall performance in other areas including but not limited to safety and environmental goals and regulatory compliance 

 

all of our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries including kmgp services company inc are eligible to participate in the plan except employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement unless such agreement expressly provides for eligibility under the plan however only eligible employees who are selected by kmr’s compensation committee will actually participate in the plan and receive bonuses 

 

the plan consists of two components the executive plan component and the nonexecutive plan component our chairman and chief executive officer and all employees who report directly to the chairman including all of the named executive officers are eligible for the executive plan component however as stated elsewhere in this “compensation discussion and analysis” richard d kinder has elected to not participate under the plan as of december 31 2010 excluding mr kinder eleven of our executive officers were eligible to participate in the executive plan component all other us and canadian eligible employees were eligible for the nonexecutive plan component 

 

at or before the start of the calendar year or later to the extent allowed under internal revenue code regulations financial performance objectives based on one or more of the criteria set forth in the plan are established by kmr’s compensation committee two financial performance objectives were set for 2010 under both the executive plan component and the nonexecutive plan component the two financial performance objectives were 

 

 

 

 

 

a third objective which could potentially decrease or increase the budgeted pool of bonus dollars for 2010 was a goal to improve our environmental health and safety performance by i beating industry average incident rates and ii improving our incident rates compared to our previous three year averages at the end of 2010 the extent to which the financial performance objectives had been attained and the extent to which the bonus opportunity had been earned under the formula previously established by kmr’s compensation committee was determined for 2010 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

based on the above our compensation committee recommended that 9365 of the 2010 budgeted cash bonus opportunity be earned and funded under the plan the approved funding level includes any premium pay calculations for bonus awards paid to nonexempt employees notwithstanding the named executive officers were awarded less than 9365 of what they otherwise would have been awarded for 2010 had 100 of the budgeted cash bonus opportunity been earned and funded 

 

in addition to determining the financial performance objectives under the plan at or before the start of each calendar year our compensation committee sets the bonus opportunities available to each executive officer the table below sets forth the maximum bonus opportunities that could have been payable by us and kmp collectively to the named executive officers for achievement of the threshold target and maximum 2010 financial performance objectives established under the plan if neither of the financial performance objectives was met no bonus opportunity would be available to the named executive officers the maximum payout to any individual under the plan for any year is 30 million our compensation committee may reduce the amount of the bonus actually paid to any executive officer from the amount of any bonus opportunity open to such executive officer because payments under the plan for our executive officers are determined by comparing actual performance to the performance objectives established each year for eligible executive officers chosen to participate for that year it is not possible to accurately predict any amounts that will actually be paid under the executive portion of the plan over the life of the plan our compensation committee set maximum bonus opportunities under the plan for 2010 for the executive officers at dollar amounts in excess of that which were expected to actually be paid under the plan in fact while achievement of the financial performance objectives sets the maximum bonus opportunity for each executive officer our compensation committee has never awarded the maximum bonus opportunity to a current named executive officer the actual payout amounts under the nonequity incentive plan awards made for 2010 paid in 2011 are set forth in the summary compensation table in the column entitled “nonequity incentive plan compensation” 

 

kinder morgan inc annual incentive plan bonus opportunities for 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 2010 bonuses for our executive officers were overwhelmingly based on whether the established financial performance objectives were met the compensation committee also considered in a purely subjective manner how well the executive officer performed his or her duties during the year information was solicited from relevant members of senior management regarding the performance of our named executive officers described following and determinations and recommendations were made at the regularly scheduled first quarter board and compensation committee meetings held in january 2011 other factors considered by the compensation committee primarily consisted of the amount of the bonus paid to the executive officer in the prior year and market data about compensation of comparable positions of responsibility at comparable companies consisting of the compensation surveys referred to above with respect to using these other factors in assessing performance our compensation committee did not find it practicable to and did not use a “score card” or quantify or assign relative weight to the specific criteria considered the amount of a downward adjustment subject to the maximum bonus opportunity that was established at the beginning of the year was not subject 

 

  

  

 

 

 

to a formula specific aspects of an individual’s performance were not identified in advance rather adjustments were based on our compensation committee’s judgment giving consideration to the totality of the record presented including the individual’s performance and the magnitude of any other positive or negative factors

in connection with kinder morgan kansas inc’s going private transaction members of our management were awarded kinder morgan holdco llc class a1 and class b units in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we are required to recognize compensation expense in connection with the class a1 and class b units over the expected life of such units the class a1 and class b units awarded to members of our management may be viewed as a replacement of restricted stock awards made by kinder morgan kansas inc prior to the going private transaction as a component of longterm executive compensation we recognized compensation expense with respect to such units however we have no obligation nor do we expect to pay any amounts in respect of such units or shares into which they were converted as described below

employment agreement on october 7 1999 richard d kinder entered into an employment agreement with us pursuant to which he agreed to serve as our chairman and chief executive officer his employment agreement provides for a term of three years and one year extensions on each anniversary of october 7th mr kinder at his initiative accepted an annual salary of 1 to demonstrate his belief in kmp’s and our longterm viability mr kinder continues to accept an annual salary of 1 and he receives no other compensation from us 

 

we believe that mr kinder’s employment agreement contains provisions that are beneficial to us and our subsidiaries and accordingly mr kinder’s employment agreement is extended annually at the request of our and kmr’s boards of directors for example with limited exceptions mr kinder is prevented from competing in any manner with us or any of our subsidiaries while he is employed by us and for 12 months following the termination of his employment with us the employment agreement provides that he will receive a severance payment equal to 225 million in the event his employment is terminated without “cause”as defined in the employment agreements or in the event he is subject to a “change in duties”as defined in the employment agreements without his consent his employment agreement also provides that in the event of his death or termination due to his total and permanent disability he or his estate will receive an amount equal to the greater of his annual salary 1 or 750000 and in the case of his total and permanent disability such amount will be an annual amount until the effective date of termination of employment in addition under the terms of our shareholders agreement mr kinder also has agreed not to compete with us or any of our subsidiaries for an additional period of one year and not to solicit our or any of our subsidiaries’ employees or interfere with certain of our business relationships during the term of his employment and for two years thereafter 

 

upon a change in control and a termination of mr kinder’s employment by us or by mr kinder certain payments made to him could be subject to the excise tax imposed on “excess parachute payments” by the internal revenue code pursuant to his employment agreement mr kinder is entitled to have his compensation “grossed up” for all such excise taxes and any federal state and local taxes applicable to such grossup payment including any penalties and interest we estimate the amount of such gross up payment for mr kinder’s termination payment and benefits to be approximately 105 million the estimate of “excess parachute payments” for purposes of these calculations does not take into account any mitigation for payments which could be shown under the facts and circumstances not to be contingent on a change in control or for any payments being made in consideration of noncompetition agreements or as reasonable compensation the grossup calculations assume an excise tax rate of 20 a statutory federal income tax rate of 35 and a medicare tax rate of 145 if upon a change in control mr kinder’s employment does not terminate he would only be entitled to the immediate vesting of any of our class b shares 

 

severance agreements  in connection with our initial public offering we entered into severance agreements with respect to eleven of our and our subsidiaries’ executive officers including our named executive officers other than richard d kinder that provide severance in the amount of the executive’s salary plus benefits during the executive’s noncompete period ranging from one to two years following the executive’s termination of employment if the executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment for “good reason” as defined in the severance agreements or the executive’s employment with us and our subsidiaries is terminated “without cause” as defined in the severance agreements the other employees who did not enter into severance agreements with us are eligible for the same severance policy as all regular full time usbased employees not covered by a bargaining agreement which caps severance payments at an amount equal to six months of salary

risks associated with compensation practices
