competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bsh bosch electrolux haier hisense lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint the competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchase practices towards ecommerce and other channels moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings optimizing our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

seasonality 

the companys quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including holidaydriven promotional periods in each fiscal year the companys total revenue and operating margins are typically highest in the third and fourth quarter in 2021 and 2020 we have realized a seasonality pattern that differed from historical periods due to the covid19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors in 2022 the company expects the seasonal pattern of revenues and operating margins to return to historical norms 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to leverage our global scale to qualify and use alternate materials though sometimes at premium costs in 2021 and 2020 our industry was impacted by supply constraints with our suppliers factories and logistics providers based in significant part on certain weather events and natural disasters out of our control in 2022 we expect supply constraints and disruptions inflation and other macroeconomic factors to continue to impact our business operations 

working capital 

the company maintains varying levels of working capital throughout the year to support business needs and customer requirements through various inventory management techniques including demand forecasting and planning see the financial condition and liquidity section of the “managements discussion and analysis” section of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our working capital requirements and processes

government regulation and protection of the environment 

at whirlpool we believe our vision to be the world’s best kitchen and laundry company in constant pursuit of improving life at home is an urgent call to action our commitment to sustainability is guided by this belief and brought to life through the choices and investments we make to protect our shared environment to support our employees’ continuous growth and ensure their safety and to always do our best to uplift our communities and we are uniquely placed to achieve that 

we know that an environmentally sustainable whirlpool is a more competitive whirlpool  a company better positioned for longterm success our environmental social and governance esg strategy is an integral part of our longterm globally aligned strategic imperatives and operating priorities it is deeply embedded in our vision mission and values as an organization we continuously seek to identify ways to broaden our commitments to esg efforts and make progress on our goal of making life in our homes our communities and our operations better today and in the future 

we are committed to developing innovative products that drive efficiencies in water and energy use and save our consumers’ time because we consider consumer preferences and cultural influences and differences in infrastructure and availability of resources such as water and energy around the world our approach and impact vary by region in developed countries such as the us and in europe our journey in providing efficient appliances has been one of continuous success over decades of delivering on innovation while not sacrificing performance it is these purposeful innovations that have improved the lives of millions of our consumers in meaningful ways 

especially in developing countries we have focused on the introduction of unique products such as the twin tub semiautomatic washer in india the lowcost unit allows washing of more clothes with better efficiency and significant time savings these water and energy savings also help reduce our consumers’ utility bills and protect our environment our consumers can spend these time and financial savings taking care of their families in other ways 

in 2021 the company announced a global commitment to reach a net zero emissions target in its plants and operations scopes 1 and 2 by 2030 which will cover more than 30 of whirlpool corporations manufacturing sites and its large distribution centers around the world we expect to achieve this target by generating and consuming renewable energy including installation of wind turbines solar panels and investing in offsite renewables through virtual power purchase agreements improvements in energy efficiency and leveraging carbon removal to offset emissions that cannot be avoided we are also committed to a 20 percent reduction in emissions linked to the use of our products scope 3 category 11 across the globe by 2030 compared to 2016 levels this target has been approved by the science based targets initiative and builds on the companys earlier reduction in emissions across all scopes since 2005 we are working to design products to make them more energy and water efficient and we are investing in innovations that automate water levels utilize cold water settings as default and help autodose detergents to further lower its environmental impacts and save consumers time and money the company is also taking actions to reduce waste material across all global manufacturing facilities and helping to prevent food waste through educational campaigns in april 2021 the company issued an inaugural sustainability bond to further advance its global sustainability strategy focusing on actions to drive positive environmental and social impacts 

we comply with all laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment and in many cases where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility these compliance requirements tend to pair well with our esg focus and we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2021 and is not expected to be material in 2022 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter government energy and environmental standards these standards have been phased in 

over the past several years and continue to be phased in and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy and related standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

our operations are also subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements concerning product energy usage data privacy cybersecurity employment conditions and worksite health and safety these requirements often provide broad discretion to government authorities and they could be interpreted or revised in ways that delay production or make production more costly the costs to comply or associated with any noncompliance are or can be significant and variable from period to period 

specific to data privacy and cybersecurity our board exercises oversight for our global information security and privacy programs this includes understanding our business needs and associated risks and reviewing managements strategy and recommendations for managing cybersecurity and privacy risks in line with this oversight responsibility the audit committee receives reports on cyber program effectiveness periodically and the board of directors receives a full presentation annually on cybersecurity related trends and program updates for our employees globally we maintain a cybersecurity and privacy training program that includes training simulated phishing exercises and regular publications on our company portal additionally we maintain a privacy program that manages compliance to privacy regulations globally 

additionally in line with the guidelines provided by health organizations around the world and consistent with our commitment to employee health and safety as our highest priority we have added various health and safety measures in our manufacturing service sales and administrative offices warehouse and distribution spaces in response to the covid19 pandemic these actions include provision of personal protection equipment to employees increased manufacturing line spacing or protective barriers to accommodate physical distancing guidelines temperature screening onsite covid19 vaccination clinics and increased enablement of remote working we may incur significant pandemicrelated expenses for additional actions in the future in line with our commitment to employee health and safety

we have listed below what we believe to be the most significant pandemicrelated strategic operational financial legal and compliance and general risks relating to our business 

covid19 pandemic risks 

our financial condition and results of operations have been impacted and may in the future be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 outbreak 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our operations and regions including its effect on our consumers operations employees trade customers suppliers and distribution channels in 2020 and 2021 the pandemic created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty which adversely impacted our manufacturing operations supply chain and distribution channels while the immediate impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed the longterm magnitude and duration of the disruption including supply chain disruption and resulting impact in global business activity remains uncertain many factors that have impacted us and others that may impact us in the future such as timing and availability of effective treatments and vaccines as well as vaccination rates among the population in the united states and many of the countries in which we operate are out of our control the adverse impact of the pandemic is expected to continue and may materially affect our financial statements in future periods 

the impacts of the pandemic include but are not limited to the following 

• production shutdowns and slowdowns because of covid as well as covidrelated government orders and supply or labor shortages in individual or collective groups of factories in impacted countries which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency and which have and could impact our ability to respond to rapid changes in demand 

• uncertainty regarding production facility operational speed and production capacity 

• lack of availability of component materials in our supply chain and an increase in raw material and component costs 

• recent and potential future reductions in trade customer sales volume potential trade customer financial restructuring or insolvency and increases in accounts receivable balances with our trade customer base 

• potential future impairment in value of certain tangible or intangible assets could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions 

• significant disruption of global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future and which together with operational impacts noted above necessitated certain liquidity creation and preservation actions as a precautionary measure at the outset of the pandemic 

• fluctuations in forecasted earnings before tax and corresponding volatility in our effective tax rate 

• uncertainty with respect to the application of economic stimulus legislation in the us and abroad including uncertainty regarding impacts to our current global tax positions and future tax planning 

• operational risk including but not limited to data privacy and cybersecurity incidents as a result of salaried workforce extended remote work arrangements uncertainty regarding returntooffice timing and duration at various administrative facilities around the world and operational delays as a result of salaried employee furlough and collective vacation actions in certain countries and restrictions on employee travel 

• operational disruption if key employees terminate their employment or become ill as well as diversion of our management teams attention from noncovid19 related matters 

• potential investigations legal claims or litigation against us for actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the pandemic and 

• potential delays in resolving pending legal matters as a result of court administrative and other closures and delays in many of our regions 

we have not yet determined with certainty the extent to which our existing insurance will respond to these impacts in addition we cannot predict the impact that covid19 will have on our trade customers suppliers consumers and each of their financial conditions however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

strategic risks 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a significant number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as those set forth in the business section of this annual report are large wellestablished companies ranking among the global fortune 150 we also face competition that may be able to quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences particularly in the connected appliance space or may be able to adapt more quickly to changes brought about by the global pandemic supply chain constraints or other factors moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices and which have and may in the future merge consolidate form alliances or further increase their relative purchasing scale competition in the global appliance industry is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design consumer taste performance innovation reputation energy efficiency service quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as promotional funds sales incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply vertically integrated business models andor highly protected home countries outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies many of our competitors have established and may expand their presence in the rapidly changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and 

other channels and the increasing global prevalence of directtoconsumer sales models in addition technological innovation is a significant competitive factor for our products as consumers continually look for new product features that save time effort and natural resources if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups andor builders could adversely affect our financial performance 

we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers including large domestic and international trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers like us as the trade customers continue to become larger through merger consolidation or organic growth they may seek and have sought to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected we also continue to pursue directtoconsumer sales globally including the launch of directtoconsumer sales on most of our brand websites in recent years which may impact our relationships with existing trade customers the loss or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product safety data privacy breaches or quality issues or negative association with any one brand could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an everincreasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our financial statements could be materially adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives and global operating platform initiative could adversely affect our financial performance 

the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation generate free cash flow and drive shareholder value an inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profitability in addition an inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance 

our ability to understand consumers’ preferences and to timely identify develop manufacture market and sell products that meet customer demand could significantly affect our business 

our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in consumer preferences including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce directtoconsumer and other channels and on successful new product development including in the connected appliance space and the digital space eg our yummly recipe app and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key product categories and geographic regions and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing environments 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements as well as agreements and policies with our employees and other parties our failure to obtain protection for or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others have in the past and may in the future assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against the development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands 

operational risks 

we face risks associated with our divestitures acquisitions other investments and joint ventures 

from time to time we make strategic divestitures acquisitions investments and participate in joint ventures for example in 2021 we divested our majority interest in whirlpool china formerly hefei sanyo and sold our manufacturing entity in turkey and in 2019 we sold our embraco compressor business in addition we acquired indesit in 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we have encountered and 

may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations undertaking postacquisition restructuring activities applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and in overseeing the operations systems and controls of acquired companies integrating acquisitions and carving out divestitures is often costly and may require significant attention from management there might also be differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products or difficulties and costs associated with obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in addition certain liabilities may be retained by whirlpool when closing a facility divesting an entity or selling physical assets and such liabilities may be material for example we agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to embraco antitrust tax environmental labor and products in connection with the embraco sale in addition the current and proposed changes to the us and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements in connection with an acquisition may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions which may jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction to us and could impede the execution of our business strategy 

we face risks associated with our presence in emerging markets 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies and noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities for example we incurred significant impairment and restructuring expenses in the years following our acquisition of indesit in 2014 in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations in addition to other risks described below under risks associated with unanticipated social political andor economic events may materially and adversely impact our business 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs 

for the year ended december 31 2021 sales outside our north america region represented approximately 43 of our net sales we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

• covid19related shutdowns the timing availability and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines and other pandemicrelated uncertainties in the countries in which we operate 

• political legal and economic instability and uncertainty 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• changes in foreign tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax laws 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including sanctions resulting from the current political situation in countries in which we do business 

• inflation andor deflation 

• changes in foreign country regulatory requirements including data privacy laws 

• various importexport restrictions and disruptions and the availability of required importexport licenses 

• imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery anticorruption regulations and antimoney laundering such as the fcpa and antitrust laws 

• labor disputes and work stoppages at our operations and suppliers 

• government price controls 

• trade customer insolvency and the inability to collect accounts receivable and 

• limitations on the repatriation or movement of earnings and cash 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

risks associated with unanticipated social political andor economic events may materially and adversely impact our business 

terrorist attacks cyber events armed conflicts civil unrest espionage natural disasters governmental actions epidemics and pandemics including the impacts of covid19 discussed elsewhere in risk factors have and could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products many of such events have impacted and could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 

we have been and may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results 

we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations to interface with our customers consumers and employees to maintain the continuity of our manufacturing operations and to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency in addition we collect store and process confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls our business processes and data sharing across suppliers and vendors is dependent on technology system availability our systems may depend directly or indirectly on software developed by third parties such as open source libraries or vendor software and we may have limited visibility into the robustness of the security practices followed during design development or remediation of this third party software the failure of any such systems whether internal or thirdparty could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other financial and business disruptions employee relations issues the loss of or damage to intellectual property and the unauthorized disclosure or 

compromise of personally identifiable data of consumers and employees or of commercially sensitive information 

in addition we have outsourced certain technology services and administrative functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource additional functions in the future if these service providers do not perform effectively or experience failures we may experience similar issues depending on the function involved in addition we may not achieve expected cost savings of outsourcing and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers have been in the past and could be in the future impacted by malicious activity of threat actors intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes or by unintentional datacompromising activities by our employees or service providers 

such unauthorized access has in the past and could in the future disrupt our business and result in the loss of assets cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include ransomware attacks attempts to gain unauthorized access to data social engineering and other security breaches that have in the past and could in the future lead to disruptions in availability of critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our growth in the areas of directtoconsumer sales and connected appliances the internet of things accompanied by increasing handling of consumer information and our reliance on pandemicdriven remote work arrangements has increased these risks these events have in the past and could in the future impact our customers consumers employees thirdparties and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential litigation or regulatory liability or an increase in expenses while we have not experienced any material impacts from a cyber attack any one or more future cyber attacks could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we have been and may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim product recall or other corrective action that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our financial statements for example we have undertaken corrective action initiatives in emea related to certain legacy indesitdesigned washer and indesitproduced dryers we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may be involved in class action litigation or product recalls for which we generally have not purchased insurance and may be involved in other litigation or events for which insurance products may have limitations 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating certain potential quality and safety issues globally and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by us or the supplier and if borne by us whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance 

we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results 

our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including covid19related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns transportation delays work stoppages labor relations governmental regulatory and enforcement actions intellectual property claims against suppliers disputes with suppliers distributors or transportation providers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy information technology failures hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters including due to climate change and increased homeland security requirements in the us and other countries for example we expect to continue to be impacted by supply chain issues due to factors largely beyond our control a global shortage of certain components such as semiconductors a strain on raw material and input cost inflation all of which could escalate in future quarters these issues have and could delay importation of products andor components or require us to locate alternative providers to avoid disruption to customers these alternatives have not and in the future may not be available on short notice and have and in the future could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements 

insurance for certain disruptions may not be available affordable or adequate the effects of climate change including extreme weather events longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks such disruption has in the past and could in the future interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth 

we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business operations engineering technology and the home appliance industry while we strive to attract develop and retain these individuals through execution of our human capital strategy see “human capital management” in item 1 we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us in the case of talent losses significant time is required to hire develop and train skilled replacement personnel we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite engineering and technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and services particularly as we increase investment in our digital and “internet of things” capabilities 

like many other companies we are subject to fluctuations in the availability of qualified labor in certain key positions as an example in todays labor market it is challenging to attract and retain qualified talent for key roles within the company which could lead to increased wage inflation or impede our ability to execute certain key strategic initiatives as we respond to this labor shortage 

a shortage of key employees can jeopardize the company’s ability to implement its business objectives and changes in key executives can result in loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge departures of other key employees disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transition periods in addition if we are unable to enforce certain noncompete covenants and confidentiality provisions when key employees leave for a competitor we may lose a competitive advantage arising from confidential and proprietary company information known to such former employees an inability to hire develop transfer retained knowledge engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 69000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all in addition our global restructuring activities have in the past and may in the future be received negatively by governments and unions and attract negative media attention which may delay the implementation of such plans a deterioration in labor relations may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

financial risks 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results 

the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations or availability due to supply and demand trends the covid19 pandemic transportation and fuel costs port and shipping capacity labor costs or disputes government regulations including increased homeland security requirements and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate severe weather climate change and other unforeseen circumstances for example we experienced raw material inflation of approximately 10 billion in 2021 in addition to many other cost increases throughout our business in addition we engage in contract negotiations and enter into commodity swap contracts to manage risk associated with certain commodities purchases and we have in the past and may in the future experience losses based on commodity price changes significant increases in materials cost and availability and other costs now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements as an example in recent years the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant levels of commodity logistics and wage inflation across our businesses we have responded to these inflationary factors with strong cost reduction initiatives and costbased price increases an inability to respond to inflationary pressures effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars as we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the 

amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks on our balance sheet we test the goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates ebit margins capital expenditures working capital requirements tax rates terminal growth rates discount rates royalty rates benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergies available to market participants declines in market conditions a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue for our trademarks a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time an increase in the marketbased weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates among other factors are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable we did not record any impairment charges for the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to other intangibles for the year ended december 31 2020 related to the emea reporting unit we may in the future be required to record a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets may adversely affect our operating results 

our longlived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group the results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions our financial performance trends or an increase in interest rates among other factors if as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our longlived asset groups is less than its carrying amount we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

we face inventory valuation risk 

we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial statements 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen on or before december 31 2006 for substantially all participants since 2007 us employees have been eligible for an enhanced employer contribution under whirlpools defined contribution 401k plan 

as of december 31 2021 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 05 billion including 03 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 02 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns health care cost trend rates and regulatory changes all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

legal  compliance risks 

unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance 

we are or may in the future become subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and indirect taxes environmental matters including matters related to climate change corporate matters commercial matters credit matters competition laws distribution marketing and trade practice matters customs and duties occupational health and safety including matters related to the covid19 pandemic industrial accidents anti–bribery and anti–corruption regulations energy regulations data privacy regulations financial and securities regulations and employment and benefit matters for example we are currently disputing certain income and indirect tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities see note 8 and note 15 we are disputing a proposed irs income tax assessment in the united states sixth circuit court of appeals see note 15 and we are disputing certain income and indirect tax assessments in various legal proceedings in italy india and other jurisdictions globally unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is costeffectively available regardless of merit legal and regulatory proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such proceedings could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image regardless of the existence or amount of liability we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves we may experience additional delays in resolving these matters as a result of covid19related administrative and judicial system temporary delays 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust and productrelated laws and regulations violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations for example the second part of a french competition authority investigation which is expected to focus primarily on manufacturer interactions with retailers is ongoing the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment including data privacy and protection and changes in taxes and tariffs could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation or regulatory action 

the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising labeling safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in countries in which we operate in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy and data protection laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 the brazilian general data protection law which came into effect in september 2020 and various other privacy and data protection laws that have been passed or are pending in other countries collectively impose or will impose new regulatory data privacy and protection standards for which we must comply some of the laws allow for significant fines reaching several percentage points of global corporate revenues or more these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply or being alleged as failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations 

additionally as a global company based in the united states we are exposed to the impact of us and global tax changes especially those that affect the effective corporate income tax rate in addition the current domestic and international political environment including government shutdowns and changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy many of our most significant competitors are global companies and in an escalating global trade conflict or the imposition of tariffs their respective governments may impose regulations that are favorable to our competitors the us federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations these regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and for additional information about global trade and tariffs please see other matters in the managements discussion and analysis section of this annual report on form 10k 

the impact of climate change and climate change or other environmental regulation may adversely impact our business 

the effects of climate change could have an impact on our business and cause us to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment human health and safety and water and energy efficiency climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes or product offerings or undertake other costly activities we are also subject to global regulations related to chemical substances and materials in our products such as the us toxic substances control act which may require us to modify the materials used in our products or undertake activities which may have a cost impact there is also increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental entities on sustainability matters in addition a number of governmental bodies have finalized proposed or are contemplating additional legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential effects of climate change in particular cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect our business 

we have set rigorous sciencebased targets for greenhouse gas reductions and related sustainability goals including a netzero emissions target in our plants and operations that was 

announced in 2021 any failure to achieve our sustainability goals or reduce our impact on the environment any changes in the scientific or governmental metrics utilized to objectively measure success or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change could result in negative publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation 

general risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

the current domestic and international political and economic environment are posing challenges to the industry in which we operate a number of economic factors including the impact of the covid19 pandemic gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates currency controls inflation and deflation generally affect demand for our products in the us and other countries which we operate 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and has caused and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability has caused and may cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions have affected and may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we expect to continue to be impacted by the global supply chain issues discussed above under operational risks 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to access liquidity or borrow to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our financial statements may be materially and adversely affected

forwardlooking perspective 

based on internal projections for the industry and broader economy we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2022 to be within the following ranges 



for the fullyear 2022 we expect the following key trends to continue and have incorporated our latest expectations of these in our guidance continued supply constraints and elevated inflationary costs as well as positive pricemix led by previously announced costbased price increases our anticipated tax rate is between 240 and 260 additionally we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 22 billion and free cash flow of 15 billion including restructuring cash outlays of approximately 50 million and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of approximately 700 million 

the table below reconciles projected 2022 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations for 2022 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for additional information regarding nongaap financial measures see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures some of which we refer to as ongoing measures including 

• earnings before interest and taxes ebit 

• ebit margin 

• ongoing ebit 

• ongoing earnings per diluted share 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

• ongoing ebit margin 

• sales excluding foreign currency 

• organic net sales net sales excluding foreign currency and embraco 

• free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow 

• gross debt leverage 

ongoing measures including ongoing earnings per diluted share and ongoing ebit exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses ebit margin is calculated by dividing ebit by net sales sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales organic net sales is calculated by excluding divestitures and foreign currency management believes that organic net sales and sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and in the case of organic net sales excluding the impact of our embraco compressor business divested in july 2019 management believes that gross debt leverage gross debtongoing ebitda provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess the companys ability to pay off its incurred debt we also disclose segment ebit which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry income expense and excluding restructuring costs asset impairment charges and certain other items if any that management believes are not indicative of the regions ongoing performance as the financial metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting management believes that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations the company provides free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as longterm management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap measure for these longterm goal metrics any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the companys control whirlpool does not provide a nongaap reconciliation for its other forwardlooking longterm value creation and other goals such as organic net sales ebit and gross debtongoing ebitda as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of our business because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings loss available to whirlpool net sales net earnings as a percentage of net sales net earnings margin net earnings loss per diluted share and cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

please refer to a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures below 



1 net earnings margin is approximately 81 55 and 57 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively and is calculated by dividing net earnings loss available to whirlpool by consolidated net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

2 ongoing ebit margin is approximately 108 90 and 68 for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively ongoing ebit margin is calculated by dividing ongoing ebit by consolidated net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding innovation and growth through capital research and development expenditures as well as opportunistic mergers and acquisitions and providing returns to shareholders through dividends share repurchases and maintaining our strong investment grade rating 

the company believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations whirlpool has historically been able to leverage its strong free cash flow generation to fund our operations pay for any debt servicing costs and allocate capital for reinvestment in our business funding share repurchases and dividend payments 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities and returns to shareholders we also have 298 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt which may include repayment through refinancing free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 30 billion at december 31 2021 of which approximately half was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and expected future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes if any and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

at december 31 2021 we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in the united states switzerland brazil and india which represented 73 18 14 and 10 respectively in addition we had thirdparty accounts receivable outside of the united states greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in brazil and italy which represented 14 and 13 respectively we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally

the following table summarizes the net increase decrease in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2021 are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

cash provided by o perating activities in 2021 increased compared to 2020 the increase was primarily driven by stro ng cash earnings and improvements in working capital the improvement in working capital was driven by increased accounts payable due to raw material inflation partially offset by increased inventory due to higher input costs and a modest inventory build 

cash provided by operating activities in 2020 increased compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by strong cash earnings partially offset by working capital initiatives working capital was impacted by our ongoing accounts receivable and credit management actions along with inventory management additionally working capital was impacted by increased accounts payable driven by higher year end production levels partially offset by the timing of our year end payment schedule 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily reflects the cash impacts from the divestiture of whirlpool china approximately 341 million and our turkey manufacturing subsidiary approximately 52 million as well as an increase in capital expenditures approximately 115 million 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2020 primarily reflects the 2019 proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business approximately 1 billion partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 122 million and the proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 139 million 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2019 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business approximately 1 billion along with proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 140 million and a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 60 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 primarily reflects lower debt issuance proceeds approximately 733 million along with higher share repurchases approximately 920 million partially offset by lower repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 273 million net effect of reduced shortterm debt increase of approximately 330 million 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2020 primarily reflects higher debt issuance proceeds increase of approximately 300 million lower repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 400 million net effect of reduced shortterm debt increase of approximately 400 million shortterm debt reflects the activity on the 1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019 offset by the reduced need to fund working capital through short term debt 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily reflects higher repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 550 million net effect of changes in shortterm debt increase of approximately 14 billion partially offset by lower share repurchase activity decrease of approximately 1 billion shortterm debt reflects the activity on the 1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019 offset by changes in commercial paper for funding normal working capital requirements 

dividends paid in financing activities were 338 million 311 million and 305 million during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

other material obligations include offbalance sheet arrangements arising in the normal course of business they primarily consist of agreements we enter into with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and other governmental obligations and debt agreements at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 294 million and 423 million outstanding under these agreements respectively

dividends 

in april 2021 our board of directors approved a 120 increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to 140 per share from 125 per share representing the 9th consecutive year of increased dividends 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience forecasted events changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2021 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2022 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2021 the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2021 retirement obligations and 2022 retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 



1 projected benefit obligation pbo for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo for other postretirement benefit plans 

these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards general business credits and deductible temporary differences will be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had total deferred tax assets of 30 billion and 34 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 195 million and 214 million respectively the company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years the tax expense has been influenced primarily by foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

we have various tax filings with applicable jurisdictions to defend our positions with regards to the timing and amount of deductions and credits as well as the allocation of income across various jurisdictions we regularly inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken to ensure the timely recording of liabilities for tax positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we believe that our estimates and judgements with respect to uncertain tax positions are reasonable and accurate at the time they are developed however actual results may differ due to unforeseen future events and circumstances if one or more of the applicable taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefits we have recorded it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in outcomes that are unfavorable to the company for additional information about income taxes see note 1 note 8 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 warranty expense as a percentage of consolidated net sales approximated 15 and 14 respectively for additional information about warranty obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had goodwill of approximate ly 25 billion and 25 billion respectively we have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately 19 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is below the carrying amount we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative assessments performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible actual and projected revenue and ebit margin relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying value 

for our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2021 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks the company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinitelived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value primarily by using the income approach the income approach uses each reporting units projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital the financial projections reflect managements best estimate of economic and market conditions over the fiveyear projected period including forecasted revenue growth ebit margin tax rate capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate for one of our reporting units we use a blended approach that includes a market capitalization methodology given publicly available information and a discounted cash flow approach the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units we also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2021 the fair values of our north america asia emea and latin america reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 306 258 29 and 20 respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelived intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

the fair value of the maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of 1021 million by approximately 11 we expect future fiscal year revenue for this brand to improve as we recover from temporary volume loss from supply chain disruptions and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments 

the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by an amount sufficient to not be deemed at risk 

in performing the quantitative assessment on these assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty model included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues in the maytag trademark would reduce the fair value of the trademark to its carrying value 

in determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

trademarks the most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category based on this analysis we determined a royalty rate of 4 for the maytag trademark we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value of maytag  noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately 24 million 

in developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined the discount rate to be 1025 for maytag  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value for maytag noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately 8 million 

based on our quantitative impairment assessment as of october 1 2020 the carrying value of the hotpoint trademark exceeded its fair value by €6 million approximately 7 million usd and we recorded an intangible impairment charge in this amount during the fourth quarter of 2020 there were no other impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets in 2020 or 2021 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

for additional information about goodwill and indefinitelife intangible valuations see note 6 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

antidumping and safeguard petition 

as previously reported whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that samsung lg and electrolux violated us and international trade laws by dumping large residential washers into the us those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain large residential washers imported from south korea mexico and china and countervailing duties on certain large residential washers from south korea in march 2019 the order covering certain large residential washers from mexico was extended for an additional five years while the order covering certain large residential washers from south korea was revoked the order covering certain large residential washers from china is currently subject to administrative review to determine whether the order should be extended

whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in may 2017 to address our concerns that samsung and lg were evading us trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders a safeguard remedy went into effect in february 2018 implementing tariffs on finished large residential washers and certain covered parts for three years in january 2021 the remedy was extended for two years until february 2023 during the fourth year of the remedy beginning february 7 2021 the remedy imposes a 15 tariff on the first 12 million large residential washers imported into the united states under tariff and a 35 tariff on such imports in excess of 12 million and also imposes a 35 tariff on washer tub drum and cabinet imports in excess of 110000 consistent with modifications to the order approved in 2020 the 12 million under tariff is allocated by quarter 300000 large residential washers per quarter we cannot speculate on the modifications impact in future quarters which will depend on samsung and lgs us production capabilities and import plans these orders are subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals 

raw materials and global economy 

the current domestic and international political environment have contributed to uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy we have experienced raw material inflation in certain prior years based on the impact of us tariffs and other global macroeconomic factors due to many factors beyond our control we expect to continue to be impacted by the following factors global shortage of certain components other supply chain constraints and cost inflation all of which we expect to continue in 2022 this could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operational and compliance and reporting risks the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options currency swaps and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities at december 31 2021 and 2020 our most significant foreign currency exposures related to the brazilian real canadian dollar and british pound we also use forward or option contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries these foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2021 a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 357 million or loss of approximately 365 million respectively consistent with the use of these contracts to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate risk from probable longterm debt issuances or crosscurrency debt at december 31 2021 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 53 million or unrealized loss of approximately 74 million respectively related to these contracts 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts at december 31 2021 a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 26 million respectively related to these contracts 

there is no material change to market risk exposure other than foreign exchange which is attributable to a change in the size of the derivative portfolio year over year for additional information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bsh bosch electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint the competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchase practices towards ecommerce and other channels moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings optimizing our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules in 2020 our industry was impacted by covid19 pandemic related supply constraints with our suppliers factories and logistics providers in 2021 pandemic related supply constraints and disruptions may continue to impact our business operations 

working capital

government regulation and protection of the environment 

we know that an environmentally sustainable whirlpool is a more competitive whirlpool — a company better positioned for longterm success our commitment to environmental responsibility is embedded in our operations and is focused on our three pillars sustainable plants sustainable products and sustainable practices we comply with all laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment and in many cases where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2020 and is not expected to be material in 2021 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter government energy and environmental standards these standards have been and continue to be phased in over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy and related standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial statements arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters 

our operations are also subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements concerning product energy usage data privacy employment conditions and worksite health and safety these requirements often provide broad discretion to government authorities and they could be interpreted or revised in ways that delay production or make production more costly the costs to comply or associated with any noncompliance are or can be significant and variable from period to period 

additionally in line with the guidelines provided by health organizations around the world and consistent with our commitment to employee health and safety as our highest priority we have added various health and safety measures in our manufacturing service sales and administrative offices warehouse and distribution spaces in response to the covid19 pandemic these actions include provision of personal protection equipment to employees increased manufacturing line spacing or protective barriers to accommodate physical distancing guidelines temperature screening and increased enablement of remote working we may incur significant covid19related expenses for additional actions in the future in line with our commitment to employee health and safety 

human capital management 

at whirlpool our values guide everything we do we are committed to the highest standards of ethical and legal conduct and have created an environment where open and honest communication is the expectation not the exception we hold our employees to this standard and offer the same in return our integrity manual was created to help our employees follow our commitment to win the 

right way additionally our supplier code of conduct formalizes the key principles under which whirlpool’s suppliers are required to operate 

our human capital strategy is built around three pillars

we have listed below what we believe to be the most significant pandemicrelated strategic operational financial legal and compliance and general risks relating to our business 

covid19 pandemic risks 

our financial condition and results of operations have been impacted and may in the future be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 outbreak 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on all aspects of our operations and regions including its effect on our consumers employees trade customers suppliers and distribution channels in 2020 the pandemic created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty which adversely impacted our manufacturing operations supply chain and distribution channels while the immediate impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed the longterm magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in global business activity remains uncertain many factors that have impacted us and others that will impact us in the future such as availability of effective treatments and vaccines are out of our control the adverse impact of the pandemic is expected to continue and may materially affect our financial statements in future periods 

the impacts of the pandemic include but are not limited to the following 

• production shutdowns and slowdowns because of covid as well as covidrelated government orders and supply or labor shortages in individual or collective groups of factories in impacted countries which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency and which have and could impact our ability to respond to rapid changes in demand 

• uncertainty regarding the timing for our production facilities to return to precovid operational speed and production capacity 

• lack of availability of component materials in our supply chain and an increase in raw material and component costs 

• recent and potential future reductions in trade customer sales volume potential trade customer financial restructuring or insolvency and increases in accounts receivable balances with our trade customer base 

• potential future impairment in value of certain tangible or intangible assets could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions 

• significant disruption of global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future and which together with operational impacts noted above necessitated certain liquidity creation and preservation actions as a precautionary measure in 2020 

• fluctuations in forecasted earnings before tax and corresponding volatility in our effective tax rate 

• uncertainty with respect to the application of economic stimulus legislation in the us and abroad including uncertainty regarding impacts to our current global tax positions and future tax planning 

• operational risk including but not limited to data privacy and cybersecurity incidents as a result of salaried workforce extended remote work arrangements and operational delays as a result of salaried employee furlough and collective vacation actions in certain countries and restrictions on employee travel 

• operational disruption if key employees terminate their employment or become ill as well as diversion of our management teams attention from noncovid19 related matters 

• potential investigations legal claims or litigation against us for actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the pandemic and 

• potential delays in resolving pending legal matters as a result of court administrative and other closures and delays in many of our regions 

we have not yet determined with certainty the extent to which our existing insurance will respond to these impacts in addition we cannot predict the impact that covid19 will have on our trade customers suppliers consumers and each of their financial conditions however any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

strategic risks 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a significant number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as those set forth in the business section of this annual report are large wellestablished companies ranking among the global fortune 150 we also face competition that may be able to quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences particularly in the connected appliance space moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices and which may in the future merge consolidate form alliances or further increase their relative purchasing scale competition in the global appliance industry is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design consumer taste performance innovation reputation energy efficiency service quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as promotional funds sales incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home countries outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies many of our competitors have established and may expand their presence in the rapidly changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and other channels and the increasing global prevalence of directtoconsumer sales models in addition technological innovation is a significant competitive factor for our products if we are 

unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups andor builders could adversely affect our financial performance 

we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers including large domestic and international trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers like us as the trade customers continue to become larger through merger consolidation or organic growth they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected we also continue to pursue directtoconsumer sales globally including the launch of directtoconsumer sales on many of our brand websites in recent years which may impact our relationships with existing trade customers the loss or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product safety data privacy breaches or quality issues or negative association with any one brand could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an everincreasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives and global operating platform initiative could adversely affect our financial performance 

the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation generate free cash flow and drive shareholder value an inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profitability in addition an inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance 

our ability to understand consumers’ preferences and to timely identify develop manufacture market and sell products that meet customer demand could significantly affect our business 

our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in consumer preferences including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce directtoconsumer and other channels and on successful new product development including in the connected appliance space and the digital space eg our yummly recipe app and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key product categories and geographic regions and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing environments 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain protection for or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others have in the past and may in the future assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against the development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands 

operational risks 

we face risks associated with our divestitures acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions or divestitures investments and participate in joint ventures for example in 2019 we sold our embraco compressor business in addition we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we have encountered and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations undertaking post 

acquisition restructuring activities applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and in overseeing the operations systems and controls of acquired companies integrating acquisitions and carving out divestitures is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products in addition certain liabilities may be retained by whirlpool when closing a facility divesting an entity or selling physical assets and such liabilities may be material for example we agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to embraco antitrust tax environmental labor and products in connection with the embraco sale 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies and noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities for example we incurred significant impairment and restructuring expenses in the years following our acquisition of indesit in 2014 in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs 

for the year ended december 31 2020 sales outside our north america region represented approximately 42 of our net sales we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

• covid19related shutdowns and other pandemicrelated uncertainties in the countries in which we operate 

• political legal and economic instability and uncertainty 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• changes in foreign tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax laws 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including sanctions resulting from the current political situation in countries in which we do business 

• inflation andor deflation 

• changes in foreign country regulatory requirements including data privacy laws 

• various importexport restrictions and disruptions and the availability of required importexport licenses 

• imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery anticorruption regulations and antimoney laundering such as the fcpa and antitrust laws 

• labor disputes and work stoppages at our operations and suppliers 

• government price controls 

• trade customer insolvency and the inability to collect accounts receivable and 

• limitations on the repatriation or movement of earnings and cash 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks cyber events armed conflicts civil unrest natural disasters governmental actions epidemics and pandemics including the impacts of covid19 discussed elsewhere in risk factors have and could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 

we have been and may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results 

we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers consumers and employees as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency in addition we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls our business processes and data sharing across functions suppliers and vendors is dependent on information technology integration the failure of any systems whether internal or thirdparty during normal operation system upgrades implementations or connections could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other financial and business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and the personally identifiable data of consumers and employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as system application maintenance and certain benefit plan administration functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and personally identifiable information through system compromise or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers have been in the past and could be in the future impacted by inappropriate activity of parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes or by inadvertent data securitycompromising activities by our employees or service providers such unauthorized access has in the past and could in the future disrupt our business and result in the loss of assets cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software including ransomware attacks attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that have in the past and could in the future lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our growth in the areas of connected appliances and the internet of things as well as our reliance on pandemicdriven 

remote work arrangements has increased these risks these events have in the past and could in the future impact our customers consumers employees thirdparties and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense while we have not experienced any material impacts from a cyber attack any one or more future cyber attacks could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we have been and may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim product recall or other corrective action that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our financial statements for example we have undertaken corrective action initiatives in emea related to certain legacy indesitdesigned washer and indesitproduced dryers we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may be involved in class action litigation or product recalls for which we generally have not purchased insurance and may be involved in other litigation or events for which insurance products may have limitations 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating certain potential quality and safety issues globally and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by us or the supplier and if borne by us whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance 

we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including covid19related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for certain disruptions may not be available affordable or adequate the effects of climate change including extreme weather events longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks such disruption has in the past and could in the future interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our financial statements 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth 

we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry while we strive to attract develop and retain these individuals through execution of our human capital strategy see “human capital management” in item 1 we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us in the case of talent losses significant time is required to hire develop and train skilled replacement personnel we must also attract develop and retain individuals with the requisite engineering and technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products particularly as we increase investment in our digital and “internet of things” capabilities an inability to hire develop transfer retained knowledge engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 78000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all in addition our global restructuring activities have in the past and may in the future be received negatively by governments and unions and attract negative media attention which may delay the implementation of such plans a deterioration in labor relations may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

financial risks 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results 

the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends transportation costs labor costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances in addition we engage in contract negotiations and enter into commodity swap contracts to manage risk associated with certain commodities purchases significant increases in materials costs and other costs now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars as we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the 

amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks on our balance sheet we test the goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates ebit margins capital expenditures working capital requirements tax rates terminal growth rates discount rates royalty rates benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergies available to market participants declines in market conditions a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue for our trademarks a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time an increase in the marketbased weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates among other factors are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable we recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to other intangibles for the year ended december 31 2020 and an impairment of 747 million related to goodwill 579 million and other intangibles 168 million for the year ended december 31 2018 related to the emea reporting unit we may in the future be required to record a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets may adversely affect our operating results 

our longlived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group the results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions our financial performance trends or an increase in interest rates among other factors if as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our longlived asset groups is less than its carrying amount we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

we face inventory valuation risk 

we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial statements 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen on or before december 31 2006 for substantially all participants since 2007 us employees have been eligible for an enhanced employer contribution under whirlpools defined contribution 401k plan 

as of december 31 2020 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 07 billion including 05 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 02 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns health care cost trend rates and regulatory changes all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate or libor or the replacement of libor with one or more alternative reference rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our financial obligations and instruments are or may be made at variable interest rates that use libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark on july 27 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 on november 18 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” announced that all libor rates for certain currencies other than us dollar libor “usd libor” would cease publication at the end of 2021 on november 30 2020 iba announced that following a consultation period it intends to announce that for usd libor it intends to cease publication of 1week and 2month libor at the end of 2021 and that it does not intend to cease publication of other tenors of usd libor until june 30 2023 regulators are generally supportive of these announcements and confident that usd libor will remain a “representative” rate pursuant to procedures to be adopted which could include new or alternative methods of determining libor 

the pending cessation of libor for various currencies at the end of 2021 and in 2023 for certain tenors of usd libor will also result in replacement rates being used more widely including in the instruments documenting certain of our financial obligations for example in the us a group convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york called the alternative reference rate committee arrc and comprised of a diverse set of private sector entities has identified the secured overnight financing rate or sofr as its preferred alternative rate for the us libor and the federal reserve bank of new york has begun publishing sofr daily many banks in the us have begun entering into transactions where interest is determined based on sofr or plan to do so during the course of 2021 as recommended by arrc and certain regulators additionally many financial contracts including some which govern our financial obligations include replacement alternatives for libor upon the cessation of libor it is possible that some us lenders will elect to use alternative rates other than sofr central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies 

the potential consequences of these changes cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could adversely affect our financial statements changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows in addition any transaction process could involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on libor reductions in the value of certain instruments mismatches between rates in hedging documentation and in the documentation for the underlying obligation being hedged increased borrowing costs uncertainty under applicable documentation andor difficult and costly consent processes 

legal  compliance risks 

unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and indirect taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters credit matters competition laws distribution marketing and trade practice matters customs and duties occupational health and safety including matters related to the covid19 pandemic anti–bribery and anti–corruption regulations energy regulations data privacy regulations financial and securities regulations and employment and benefit matters for example we are currently disputing certain income and indirect tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities see note 8 and note 15 we are disputing a proposed irs income tax assessment in the united states sixth circuit court of appeals see note 15 and we are disputing certain income and indirect tax assessments in various legal proceedings in italy india and other jurisdictions globally unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is costeffectively available regardless of merit legal and regulatory proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such proceedings could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image regardless of the existence or amount of liability we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves we may experience additional delays in resolving these matters as a result of covid19related administrative and judicial system temporary delays 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust and productrelated laws and regulations violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations for example the second part of a french competition authority investigation which is expected to focus primarily on manufacturer interactions with retailers is ongoing the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment including data privacy potential climate regulations and changes in taxes and tariffs could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation 

the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising labeling safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in countries in which we operate in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy and data access laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure for example the european union’s general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 the 

california consumer privacy act of 2018 which came into effect on january 1 2020 and the california privacy rights and enforcement act which will become effective on january 1 2023 collectively impose or will impose new regulatory data privacy standards for which we must comply these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities 

in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment human health and safety and water and energy efficiency climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes or product offerings or undertake other costly activities we are also subject to global regulations related to chemical substances and materials in our products such as the us toxic substances control act which may require us to modify the materials used in our products or undertake activities which may have a cost impact there is also increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental entities on sustainability matters we have set rigorous sciencebased targets for greenhouse gas reductions and related sustainability goals and any failure to achieve our sustainability goals or reduce our impact on the environment any changes in the scientific or governmental metrics utilized to objectively measure success or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change could result in negative publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation 

additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply or being alleged as failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could also adversely affect us 

additionally as a global company based in the united states we are exposed to the impact of us tax changes especially those that affect the effective corporate income tax rate in addition the current domestic and international political environment including government shutdowns and changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy many of our most significant competitors are global companies and in an escalating global trade conflict or the imposition of tariffs their respective governments may impose regulations that are favorable to our competitors the us federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations these regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and for additional information about global trade and tariffs please see other matters in the managements discussion and analysis section of this annual report on form 10k 

general risks 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

the current domestic and international political and economic environment are posing challenges to the industry in which we operate a number of economic factors including the impact of the covid19 pandemic gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates currency controls inflation and deflation generally affect demand for our products in the us and other countries which we operate 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and has caused and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or 

reduced profitability has caused and may cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions have affected and may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example the effect of the uks exit from the european union “brexit” despite their december 2020 trade agreement remains uncertain and could adversely impact certain areas of our business including but not limited to an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our financial statements may be materially and adversely affected

the increase in tax expense in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings before tax reduced foreign tax credits and the sale of embraco partially offset by net reductions in valuation allowances and impacts from a statutory legal entity restructuring as part of ongoing efforts to reduce costs and simplify the companys legal entity structure the company completed in 2019 a statutory legal entity restructuring within our emea business the completion of the restructuring created a taxdeductible loss which was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in a 147 million tax benefit

forwardlooking perspective 

earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax while each adjustment is presented on a pretax basis the aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2021 fullyear tax rate between 240 and 260 based on internal projections for the industry and broader economy we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2021 to be within the following ranges 



for the fullyear 2021 we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 16 billion and free cash flow of 1 billion or more including restructuring cash outlays of approximately 225 million and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of approximately 600 million 

the table below reconciles projected 2021 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations for 2021 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses for additional information regarding nongaap financial measures see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures some of which we refer to as ongoing measures including 

• earnings before interest and taxes ebit 

• ebit margin 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

• ongoing ebit 

• ongoing earnings per diluted share 

• ongoing ebit margin 

• sales excluding foreign currency 

• organic net sales net sales excluding foreign currency and embraco 

• free cash flow 

ongoing measures including ongoing earnings per diluted share and ongoing ebit exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses ebit margin is calculated by dividing ebit by net sales ongoing ebit margin is calculated by dividing ongoing ebit by net sales for 2020 2019 and 2018 sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales organic net sales is calculated by excluding divestitures and foreign currency management believes that organic net sales and sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and in the case of organic net sales excluding the impact of our embraco compressor business divested in july 2019 we also disclose segment ebit which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry income expense and excluding restructuring costs asset impairment charges and certain other items if any that management believes are not indicative of the regions ongoing performance as the financial metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations the company provides free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as longterm management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap measure for these longterm goal metrics any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the companys control whirlpool does not provide a nongaap reconciliation for its other forwardlooking longterm value creation and other goals such as organic net sales ebit and gross debtebitda as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of our business because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings loss available to whirlpool net sales net earnings as a percentage of net sales net earnings margin net earnings loss per diluted share and cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding innovation and growth through capital research and development expenditures as well as opportunistic mergers and acquisitions and providing returns to shareholders through dividends share repurchases and maintaining our strong investment grade rating 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities and returns to shareholders we also have 298 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt which may include repayment through refinancing free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 29 billion at december 31 2020 of which approximately half was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and expected future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes if any and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

at december 31 2020 we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in the united states china brazil india and mexico which represented 65 17 17 14 and 14 respectively in addition we had thirdparty accounts receivable outside of the united states greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in brazil and italy which represented 18 and 11 respectively  we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally

we continue to review customer conditions globally at december 31 2020 we had 173 million brazilian reais approximately 33 million at december 31 2020 in short and longterm receivables due to us from maquina de vendas sa a trade customer in brazil in 2018 as part of their extrajudicial recovery plan we agreed to receive payment of our outstanding receivable plus interest over eight years under a tiered payment schedule during the third quarter of 2020 we received insurance proceeds of 129 million brazilian reais approximately 23 million at september 30 2020 related to this matter after consideration of the allowance for expected credit losses we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on financial results in future periods 

in the past when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2020 through cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and financing arrangements our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31 2020 increased 982 million compared to the same period in 2019 

the following table summarizes the net increase decrease in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2020 are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2020 increased compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by strong cash earnings partially offset by working capital initiatives working capital was impacted by our ongoing accounts receivable and credit management actions along with inventory management additionally working capital was impacted by increased accounts payable driven by higher year end production levels partially offset by the timing of our year end payment schedule 

cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was comparable to 2018 the impact of working capital primarily includes inventory reductions efforts credit management activities and the divestiture of the embraco compressor business net earnings includes the noncash impacts from the gain on sale and disposal of businesses 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2018 primarily reflects 350 million of discretionary pension funding partially offset by the working capital impact from inventory reduction efforts lower volumes and credit management activities net loss includes the noncash impacts from impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2020 primarily reflects the 2019 proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business approximately 1 billion partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 122 million and the proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 139 million 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2019 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business approximately 1 billion along with proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 140 million and a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 60 million 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 primarily reflects proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 130 million a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 95 million and the proceeds related to heldtomaturity securities approximately 60 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2020 primarily reflects higher debt issuance proceeds increase of approximately 300 million lower repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 400 million net effect of reduced shortterm debt increase of approximately 400 million shortterm debt reflects the activity on the 1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019 offset by the reduced need to fund working capital through short term debt 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily reflects higher repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 550 million net effect of changes in shortterm debt increase of approximately 14 billion partially offset by lower share repurchase activity decrease of approximately 1 billion shortterm debt reflects the activity on the 1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019 offset by changes in commercial paper for funding normal working capital requirements 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2018 primarily reflects higher proceeds from borrowings of shortterm debt increase of approximately 300 million and lower repayments of longterm debt decrease of approximately 175 million partially offset by higher share repurchase activity increase of approximately 400 million we also acquired a minority interest in elica pb india 

dividends paid in financing activities approximated 300 million during 2020 2019 and 2018 

financing arrangements 

the company had total committed credit facilities of approximately 42 billion at december 31 2020 the facilities are geographically diverse and reflect the companys global operations the company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations we had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and other governmental obligations and debt agreements at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had approximately 423 million and 333 million outstanding under these agreements respectively 

for additional information about our offbalance sheet arrangements see note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2020 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2021 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2020 the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2020 retirement obligations and 2021 retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results

these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards general business credits and deductible temporary differences will be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had total deferred tax assets of 34 billion and 33 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 214 million and 192 million respectively during 2019 the company used proceeds from a bond offering to recapitalize various entities in emea which resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance in addition the company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in outcomes that are unfavorable to the company for additional information about income taxes see note 1 note 8 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had goodwill of approximately 25 billion and 24 billion respectively we have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately 19 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is below the carrying amount we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative assessments performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible actual and projected revenue and ebit margin relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible is less than its carrying value 

for our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2020 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks the company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinitelived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value primarily by using the income approach the income approach uses each reporting units projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital the financial projections reflect managements best estimate of economic and market conditions over the fiveyear projected period including forecasted revenue growth ebit margin tax rate capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate for one of our reporting units we use a blended approach that includes a market capitalization methodology given publicly available information and a discounted cash flow approach the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units we also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2020 the fair values of our north america asia and latin america reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 184 315 and 15 respectively 

based on the quantitative assessment performed for the emea reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 11 the emea reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 329 million at december 31 2020 

in evaluating the emea reporting unit significant weight was provided to forecasted ebit margins and the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

• ebit margins are expected to recover as we benefit from the recently announced strategic actions to rightsize and refocus our business including improving our pricemix driving share gains and executing on our cost takeout initiatives 

• the 5year average forecasted ebit margin in the discounted cash flow model was approximately 3 

• we used a discount rate of 1175 based on market participant assumptions 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on our emea reporting unit estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 10 reduction in the projected ebit margins in the forecasted periods would result in an impairment charge of 18 million and 31 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelived intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

based on our quantitative impairment assessment as of october 1 2020 the carrying value of the h otpoint trademark exceeded its fair value by €6 million approximately 7 million and we recorded an intangible impairment charge in this amount during the fourth quarter of 2020 there were no other impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets in 2020 

because the fair value assigned to the hotpoint  trademark is recorded as of october 1 2020 future impairments could result if the brand experiences further deterioration in business performance or if there is a significant change in other qualitative or quantitative factors including a change in the royalty rate or discount rate 

the fair value of the indesit trademark exceeded its carrying value of €190 million 232 million by 10 we expect future fiscal year net sales for this brand to improve as we stabilize volumes recover market share and benefit from our new product investments in the emea region 

the fair values of the maytag and jennair trademarks exceeded their carrying values of 1021 million and 304 million by approximately 9 and 3 respectively we expect net sales for these brands to improve as we recover temporary volume loss from covid19 related supply chain disruptions and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments 

the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 

in performing the quantitative assessment on these assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty model included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues in the maytag  jennair and indesit trademarks would result in an impairment charge of approximately 20 million 22 million and €12 million 15 million respectively a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues in the hotpoint brand would result in an impairment charge of €13 million 16 million in addition to the €6 million 7 million impairment charge in 2020 

in determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of trademarks the most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category based on this analysis we determined a royalty rate of 3 35 4 and 6 for our indesit hotpoint maytag and jennair trademarks respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for indesit maytag and jennair noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rates from each brand would result in an impairment charge of approximately €15 million 18 million 46 million and 17 million respectively a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rate from hotpoint  would result in a 34 million €28 million impairment charge in addition to the €6 million 7 million impairment charge in 2020 

in developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined the discount rates to be 1475 15 975 and 1025 for indesit hotpoint maytag and jennair respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for hotpoint maytag and jennair noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately €9 million 11 million 41 million and 31 million respectively and a 150 basis

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

point increase in the discount rate for indesit would result in an impairment charge of approximately 

€2 million 2 million hotpoint’s impairment would be in addition to the impairment charge in 2020 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

for additional information about goodwill and indefinitelife intangible valuations see note 6 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

grenfell tower 

on june 23 2017 londons metropolitan police service released a statement that it had identified a hotpoint–branded refrigerator as the initial source of the grenfell tower fire in west london uk authorities are conducting investigations including regarding the cause and spread of the fire the model in question was manufactured by indesit company between 2006 and 2009 prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in 2014 we are fully cooperating with the investigating authorities whirlpool was named as a defendant in a product liability suit in pennsylvania federal court related to this matter the federal court dismissed the case with prejudice in september 2020 the dismissal is being appealed in december 2020 lawsuits related to grenfell tower were filed in the uk against approximately 20 defendants including whirlpool corporation and certain whirlpool subsidiaries as these matters are ongoing we cannot speculate on their eventual outcomes or potential impact on our financial statements accordingly we have not recorded any significant charges in 2019 or 2020 additional claims may be filed related to this incident 

antidumping and safeguard petition 

as previously reported whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that samsung lg and electrolux violated us and international trade laws by dumping large residential washers into the us those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain large residential washers imported from south korea mexico and china and countervailing duties on certain large residential washers from south korea these orders could be subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals in march 2019 the order covering certain large residential washers from mexico was extended for an additional five years while the order covering certain large residential washers from south korea was revoked

whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in may 2017 to address our concerns that samsung and lg were evading us trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders a safeguard remedy went into effect in february 2018 implementing tariffs on finished large residential washers and certain covered parts for three years in january 2021 the remedy was extended for two years until february 2023 during the fourth year of the remedy beginning february 7 2021 the remedy imposes a 15 tariff on the first 12 million large residential washers imported into the united states under tariff and a 35 tariff on such imports in excess of 12 million and also imposes a 35 tariff on washer tub drum and cabinet imports in excess of 110000 consistent with modifications to the order approved in 2020 the 12 million under tariff is allocated by quarter 300000 large residential washers per quarter we cannot speculate on the modifications impact in future quarters which will depend on samsung and lgs us production capabilities and import plans 

raw materials and global economy 

the current domestic and international political environment have contributed to uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy we have experienced raw material inflation in certain prior years based on the impact of us tariffs and other global macroeconomic factors we expect to experience significant raw material inflation and freight cost increases in 2021 which could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period 

brexit 

in 2016 the uk held a referendum the outcome of which was an expressed public desire to exit the european union “brexit” which has resulted in greater uncertainty related to the free movement of goods services people and capital between the uk and the eu on january 31 2020 the uk officially exited the european union and entered into a transition period to negotiate the final terms of brexit and on december 30 2020 the uk and eu signed a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the relationship between the uk and eu going forward many potential future impacts of brexit remain unclear and could adversely impact certain areas of our business including but not limited to an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions in order to mitigate the risks associated with brexit we are preparing for potential adverse impacts by collaborating across company functions and working with external partners to develop and revise the necessary contingency plans

activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options currency swaps and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities at december 31 2020 our most significant foreign currency exposures related to the brazilian real canadian dollar and british pound we also use forward or option contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries these foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2020 a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 250 million or loss of approximately 273 million respectively consistent with the use of these contracts to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate risk from probable longterm debt issuances or crosscurrency debt at december 31 2020 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 32 million or unrealized loss of approximately 91 million respectively related to these contracts 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts at december 31 2020 a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 21 million respectively related to these contracts

regional business summary

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bsh bosch electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint the competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchase practices towards ecommerce and other channels moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings optimizing our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

seasonality 

the companys quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including holidaydriven promotional periods in each fiscal year the companys total revenue and operating margins are typically highest in the third and fourth quarter 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

working capital 

in order to support business needs and customer requirements the company maintains adequate levels of working capital throughout the year using various inventory management techniques including demand forecasting and planning please see the financial condition and liquidity section of the “managements discussion and analysis” section of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our working capital requirements and processes 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets we own and the licenses we hold in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the m ost important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid and amana the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint and ignis the most important trademarks to latin america are consul brastemp whirlpool kitchenaid and acros  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool and royalstar which is licensed to us we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana brand names we continually apply for and obtain patents globally the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs technologies products and services 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2019 and is not expected to be material in 2020  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter government energy and environmental standards these standards have been and continue to be phased in over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy and related standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial statements arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

we have listed below what we believe to be the most significant strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks relating to our business 

strategic risks 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as those set forth in the business section of this annual report are large wellestablished companies ranking among the global fortune 150 we also face competition that may be able to quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences particularly in the connected appliance space moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices and which may in the future merge consolidate form alliances or further increase their relative purchasing scale competition in the global appliance industry is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design consumer taste performance innovation reputation energy efficiency service quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as promotional funds sales incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home countries outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies many of our competitors have established and may expand their presence in the rapidly changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce 

and other channels and the introduction of directtoconsumer sales models if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups andor builders could adversely affect our financial performance 

we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers including lowes and other large domestic and international trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger through merger consolidation or organic growth they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected we also continue to pursue directtoconsumer sales in the us and certain other countries which may impact our relationships with existing trade customers the loss or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product safety data privacy breaches or quality issues or negative association with any one brand could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an everincreasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance 

the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation generate free cash flow and drive shareholder value an inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profitability in addition an inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce directtoconsumer and other channels and on successful new product development including in the connected appliance space and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key product categories and geographic regions and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing environments 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant part and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain protection for or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands 

operational risks 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions or divestitures investments and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in 2014 and we sold our embraco compressor business in 2019 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and in overseeing the operations systems and controls of acquired companies integrating acquisitions and carving out divestitures is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products in addition liabilities may be retained by whirlpool when closing a facility divesting an entity or selling physical assets and such liabilities may be material 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies which noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs 

for the year ended december 31  2019  sales outside our north america region represent approximately 44 of our net sales we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks cyber events armed conflicts civil unrest natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics including but not limited to the recent coronavirus outbreak originating in china could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results 

we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers consumers and employees as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency in addition we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls our business processes and data sharing across functions suppliers and vendors is dependent on information technology integration the failure of any systems whether internal or thirdparty during normal operation system upgrades implementations or connections could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other financial and business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and the personally identifiable data of consumers and employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as system application maintenance and certain benefit plan administration functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and personally identifiable information through system compromise or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers have been in the past and could be in the future impacted by inappropriate or mistaken activity of parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data our growth in the areas of connected appliances and the internet of things has increased these risks these events could impact our customers consumers employees thirdparties and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we have been and may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim product recall or other corrective action that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our financial statements we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may be involved in class action litigation for which we generally have not purchased insurance and may be involved in certain other product recalls or other litigations or events for which insurance products may have limitations 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating certain potential quality and safety issues globally and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by us or the supplier and if borne by us whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance 

we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for certain disruptions may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our financial statements 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth 

we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us in the case of talent losses significant time is required to hire develop and train skilled replacement personnel an inability to hire develop transfer retained knowledge engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business 

as of december 31  2019  we had approximately 77000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all in addition our global restructuring activities have in the past and may in the future be received negatively by governments and unions and may attract negative media attention which may delay the implementation of such plans a deterioration in labor relations may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

financial risks 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results 

the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs labor costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances for example we experienced continued inflation in raw materials and certain manufactured components during 2019 which negatively impacted our operating results in addition we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with certain commodities purchases significant increases in materials costs and other costs now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks on our balance sheet we test the goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates ebit margins capital expenditures working capital requirements tax rates terminal growth rates discount rates royalty rates benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergies available to market participants declines in market conditions a trend of weaker 

than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue for our trademarks a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time an increase in the marketbased weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates among other factors are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable we may be required to record a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets may adversely affect our operating results 

our longlived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group the results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions our financial performance trends or an increase in interest rates among other factors if as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our longlived asset groups is less than its carrying amount we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

we face inventory valuation risk 

we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial statements 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

the current domestic and international political and economic environment are posing challenges to the industry in which we operate a number of economic factors including gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates currency controls inflation and deflation generally affect demand for our products in the us and other countries which we operate 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for example the effect of the uks exit from the european union or brexit remains unclear and could adversely impact certain areas of our business including but not limited to an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our financial statements may be materially and adversely affected 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen on or before december 31 2006 for substantially all participants since 2007 us employees have been eligible for an enhanced employer contribution under whirlpools defined contribution 401k plan 

as of december 31  2019  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 09 billion including 05 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 04 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions including discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns health care cost trend rates and regulatory changes all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate or libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our financial obligations and instruments are or may be made at variable interest rates that use libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark on july 27 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is expected that most if not all banks currently reporting information to set libor will stop doing so at such time which could either cause libor publication to stop immediately or cause libors regulator to announce the discontinuation of its publication and during any such transition period libor may perform differently than in the past 

these reforms may also result in new methods of calculating libor to be established or alternative reference rates to be established for example in the us a group convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york called the alternative reference rate committee arrc and comprised of a diverse set of private sector entities has identified the secured overnight financing rate or sofr as its preferred alternative rate for the us libor and the federal reserve bank of new york has begun publishing sofr daily and central banks in several other jurisdictions have also announced plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies the potential consequences of these changes cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could adversely affect our financial statements changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows in addition any transaction process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on libor reductions in the value of certain instruments mismatches between rates in hedging documentation and in the documentation for the underlying obligation being hedged increased borrowing costs uncertainty under applicable documentation andor difficult and costly consent processes 

legal  compliance risks 

unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and indirect taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters credit matters competition laws distribution marketing and trade practice matters anti–bribery and anti–corruption regulations energy regulations data privacy regulations financial regulations and employment and benefit matters for example we are currently disputing certain income and indirect tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities see note 8 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is costeffectively available regardless of merit legal and regulatory proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such proceedings could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image regardless of the existence or amount of liability we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust and productrelated laws and regulations violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment including data privacy potential climate regulations and changes in taxes and tariffs could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation 

the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising labeling safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in countries in which we operate in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy and data access laws in effect in the various us states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities 

in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment human health and safety and water and energy efficiency climate change regulations at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions change our manufacturing processes or product offerings or undertake other costly activities there is also increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental entities on sustainability matters we have set rigorous sciencebased targets for greenhouse gas reductions and related sustainability goals and any failure to achieve our sustainability goals or reduce our impact on the environment any changes in the scientific or governmental metrics utilized to objectively measure success or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change could result in negative publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation 

additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could also adversely affect us 

additionally as a global company based in the united states we are exposed to the impact of us tax changes especially those that affect the effective corporate income tax rate in addition the current domestic and international political environment including government shutdowns and changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy the us federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations these regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and for additional information about global trade and tariffs please see other matters in the managements discussion and analysis section of this annual report on form 10k

overview 

whirlpool had fullyear gaap net earnings available to whirlpool of 12 billion net earnings margin of 58 or 1845 per share compared to gaap net loss available to whirlpool of 183 million net earnings margin of 09 or 272 per share in the same prioryear period on a gaap basis net earnings were favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of our embraco compressor business of approximately 511 million partially offset by product warranty and liability expense of approximately 131 million and losses associated with strategic actions executed in emea of approximately 74 million in the same prioryear period nonrecurring items negatively impacted net earnings available to whirlpool by approximately 850 million solid cash provided by operating activities of 12 billion was driven by higher earnings and working capital improvement 

whirlpool delivered ongoing nongaap earnings per share of 1600 and fullyear ongoing ebit margin of 69 compared to 63 in the same prioryear period these results were driven by positive pricemix and strong cost discipline which were partially offset by cost inflation increased brand investments and currency in addition we delivered strong free cash flow nongaap of 912 million primarily driven by working capital improvement and lower capital expenditures lastly we strengthened our balance sheet and made strong progress toward our longterm gross debt to ebitda target of approximately 20 

we are very pleased with the successful execution of our strong pricemix actions driven by new product introductions and costbased price increases and targeted cost takeout in addition the strong actions to restore profitability in emea resulted in approximately 75 million of ebit improvement compared to the prioryear 

we are committed to generating margin expansion and strong cash flow and are confident that our actions will drive positive results in 2020 as outlined in our longterm value creation strategy

selling general and administrative 

the following table summarizes selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment 



consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2019 is comparable to 2018  consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 increased compared to 2017 due to expenses related to the bad debt expense from a brazilian retailer expenses related to the sale of the embraco compressor business and the negative impact of unit volume declines 

restructuring 

we incurred restructuring charges of 188 million  247 million and 275 million for the years ended december 31  2019  2018 and 2017  respectively for the full year 2020 we expect to incur up to 100 million of restructuring charges driven by previously announced fixed cost reduction actions in the emea region 

see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 

we recorded an impairment charge of 747 million related to goodwill 579 million and other intangibles 168 million for the year ended december 31 2018 related to the emea reporting unit

gain loss on sale and disposal of businesses 

we recorded a pretax gain of 511 million on the sale of the embraco compressor business for the year ended december 31 2019

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

interest expense 

interest expense was 187 million  192 million and 162 million for the years ended december 31  2019  2018 and 2017  respectively interest expense in 2019 was comparable to 2018  during 2018  interest expense increased by 30 million compared to 2017  this was primarily due to higher average debt and notes payable balances and higher average interest rates 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 354 million  138 million and 550 million for the years ended december 31  2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the increase in tax expense in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings before tax reduced foreign tax credits and the sale of embraco partially offset by net reductions in valuation allowances and impacts from a statutory legal entity merger as part of ongoing efforts to reduce costs and simplify the companys legal entity structure the company has completed a statutory legal entity merger within our emea business the completion of the merger created a taxdeductible loss which was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 and resulted in a 147 million tax benefit 

the decrease in tax expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower level of earnings the reduction in statutory us tax rate from 35 to 21 impact of nondeductible goodwill impairments and government payment accruals valuation allowances and tax planning actions 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

forwardlooking perspective 

earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax while each adjustment is presented on a pretax basis the aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2020 fullyear tax rate between 20 and 25 we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2020 to be within the following ranges 



for the fullyear 2020  we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 13 billion to 14 billion and free cash flow of approximately 800 million to 900 million including restructuring cash outlays of up to 200 million and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of approximately 550 million 

the table below reconciles projected 2020 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations for 2020 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses for additional information regarding nongaap financial measures see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures some of which we refer to as ongoing measures including 

 nongaap measures exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses ebit margin is calculated by dividing ebit by net sales ongoing ebit margin is calculated by dividing ongoing ebit by net sales for 2019 and 2018 and ongoing net sales for 2017 ongoing net sales for 2017 excludes 32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales organic net sales is calculated by excluding divestitures and foreign currency management believes that organic net sales and sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we also disclose segment ebit which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry income expense and excluding restructuring costs asset impairment charges and certain other items if any that management believes are not indicative of the regions ongoing performance as the financial metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations the company provides free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as longterm management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap measure for these longterm goal metrics any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the companys control whirlpool does not provide a nongaap reconciliation for its other forwardlooking longterm value creation and other goals such as organic net sales ebit and gross debtebitda as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of our business because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings loss available to whirlpool net sales net earnings as a percentage of net sales and cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

please refer to a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures below 







1 net earnings margin is approximately 58  09 and 16 for the twelve months ended december 31  2019  2018 and 2017  respectively and is calculated by dividing net earnings loss available to whirlpool by consolidated net sales for the twelve months ended december 31  2019  2018 and 2017 of 204 billion  210 billion and 213 billion  respectively

3 proceeds from the sale of assets and business for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 include 1011 million of net cash proceeds received to date for the sale of the embraco compressor business 1000 million of these proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan in august 2019 

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities and returns to shareholders we also have 559 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt which may include repayment through refinancing free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 20 billion at december 31 2019  of which the significant majority was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries our cash and cash equivalents are temporarily elevated as of december 31 2019 from commercial paper outstanding of 274 million that was subsequently repaid after yearend for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and expected future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes if any and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

at december 31 2019  we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in china brazil the united states and india which represented 25 20 16 and 11 respectively in addition we did not have any thirdparty accounts receivable greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of the united states we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was comparable to 2018 the impact of working capital primarily includes inventory reduction efforts credit management activities and the divestiture of the embraco compressor business net earnings includes the noncash impacts from the gain on sale and disposal of businesses 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2018 primarily reflects 350 million of discretionary pension funding partially offset by the working capital impact from inventory reduction efforts lower volumes and credit management activities net loss includes the noncash impacts from impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 

cash provided by operating activities in 2017 reflects effective credit management and working capital despite lower cash earnings 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business approximately 1 billion along with proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 140 million and a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 60 million 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 primarily reflects proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 130 million a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 95 million and the proceeds related to heldtomaturity securities approximately 60 million 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2017 primarily reflects the net impact of purchases approximately 170 million and proceeds approximately 110 million related to heldtomaturity securities and an increase in capital expenditures approximately 25 million 

in june 2016 whirlpool china co ltd whirlpool china our majorityowned indirect subsidiary entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two whirlpool china plants in hefei china to a division of the hefei municipal government the aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately rmb 687 million approximately 103 million as of june 27 2016 whirlpool china received rmb 127 million approximately 20 million in 2018 and rmb 280 million approximately 42 million in 2017 the related cash flow impact from these transactions is included in investing activities in each respective year 

cash flows from financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily reflects higher repayments of longterm debt increase of approximately 550 million net effect of changes in shortterm debt increase of approximately 14 billion partially offset by lower share repurchase activity decrease of approximately 1 billion shortterm debt reflects the activity on the 1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019 offset by changes in commercial paper for funding normal working capital requirements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2018 primarily reflects higher proceeds from borrowings of shortterm debt increase of approximately 300 million and lower repayments of longterm debt decrease of approximately 175 million partially offset by higher share repurchase activity increase of approximately 400 million we also acquired the remaining minority interest in a subsidiary 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily reflects higher share repurchase activity increase of approximately 225 million 

dividends paid in financing activities approximated 300 million during 2019  2018 and 2017  

financing arrangements 

the company had total committed credit facilities of approximately 38 billion at december 31 2019  the facilities are geographically diverse and reflect the companys global operations the company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations we had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and other governmental obligations and debt agreements at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had approximately 333 million and 355 million outstanding under these agreements respectively

for additional information about our offbalance sheet arrangements see note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2019 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2020 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2019  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2019 retirement obligations and 2020 retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards general business credits and deductible temporary differences will be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had total deferred tax assets of 33 billion and 29 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 192 million and 348 million  respectively during 2019 the company used proceeds from a bond offering to recapitalize various entities in emea which resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance in addition the company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see note 1  note 8 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had goodwill of approximately 24 billion and 25 billion  respectively we have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately 19 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets is below the carrying amount we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative assessments performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible actual and projected revenue and ebit margin relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 

for our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2019 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks the company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinitelived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment 

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value primarily by using the income approach the income approach uses each reporting units projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital the financial projections reflect managements best estimate of economic and market conditions over the fiveyear projected period including forecasted revenue growth ebit margin tax rate capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate for one of our reporting units we use a blended approach that includes a market capitalization methodology given publicly available information and a discounted cash flow approach the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units we also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2019 the fair values of our nar asia and lar reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 139 253 and 27 respectively 

based on the quantitative assessment performed for the emea reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 7 the emea reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 300 million at december 31 2019 

in evaluating the emea reporting unit significant weight was provided to the forecasted ebit margins and the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

 

 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5 reduction in the projected ebit margins in the forecasted periods would result in an impairment charge of 180 million and 49 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelived intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

not own the trademark and a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

the fair value of the indesit and hotpoint trademarks exceeded their carrying value of €190 million approximately 213 million at december 31 2019 and €135 million approximately 151 million at december 31 2019 by 16 and 7 respectively we expect revenue trends for both these brands to improve as we stabilize volumes recover market share and benefit from our new product investments in the emea region 

the fair value of the maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of 1021 million by approximately 6 we expect revenue trends for this brand to continue to improve as we execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments 

the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 

in performing the quantitative assessment on these assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty model included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues in the hotpoint and maytag trademarks would result in an impairment charge of approximately 3 million and 39 million respectively and a 15 reduction of forecasted revenues in the indesit trademark would result in an impairment charge of approximately 5 million 

in determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of trademarks the most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category based on this analysis we determined a royalty rate of 3 35 and 4 for our indesit  hotpoint and maytag trademarks respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for indesit  hotpoint and maytag noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rates from each brand would result in an impairment charge of approximately 9 million 27 million and 66 million respectively 

in developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined the discount rates to be 145 15 and 975 for indesit  hotpoint and maytag  respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for maytag noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately 57 million and a 250 basis point increase in the discount rate for hotpoint and indesit would result in an impairment charge of approximately 13 million and 7 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

for additional information about goodwill and indefinitelife intangible valuations see note 6 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

the estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

grenfell tower 

on june 23 2017 londons metropolitan police service released a statement that it had identified a hotpoint–branded refrigerator as the initial source of the grenfell tower fire in west london uk authorities are conducting investigations including regarding the cause and spread of the fire the model in question was manufactured by indesit company between 2006 and 2009 prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in 2014 we are fully cooperating with the investigating authorities whirlpool has been named as a defendant in a product liability suit related to this matter which suit is currently pending in pennsylvania federal court as these matters are ongoing we cannot speculate on their eventual outcomes or potential impact on our financial statements accordingly we have not recorded any significant charges in 2018 or 2019 additional claims may be filed related to this incident 

antidumping and safeguard petition 

as previously reported whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that samsung lg and electrolux violated us and international trade laws by dumping washers into the us those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain washers imported from south korea mexico and china and countervailing duties on certain washers from south korea these orders could be subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals in march 2019 the order covering certain washers from mexico was extended for an additional five years while the order covering certain washers from south korea was revoked 

whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in may 2017 to address our concerns that samsung and lg are evading us trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders a safeguard remedy went into effect in february 2018 implementing tariffs on finished washers and certain covered parts for three years during the third year of the remedy beginning february 7 2020 the remedy imposes a 16 tariff on the first 12 million large residential washing machines imported into the united states under tariff and a 40 tariff on such imports in excess of 12 million and also imposes a 40 tariff on washer tub drum and cabinet imports in excess of 90000 units in january 2020 the president modified the safeguard order to allocate the 12 million under tariff by quarter during the third year of remedy 300000 washing machines per quarter the president maintains discretion to modify the remedy we cannot speculate on the modifications impact which will depend on samsung and lgs us production capabilities and import plans 

us tariffs and global economy 

the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy the impact of previouslyannounced us tariffs was a component of increased raw material costs during the year ended december 31 2019  we expect these and other tariffs to impact material and freight costs in future quarters which could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period 

brexit 

in 2016 the uk held a referendum the outcome of which was an expressed public desire to exit the european union “brexit” which has resulted in greater uncertainty related to the free movement of goods services people and capital between the uk and the eu on january 31 2020 the uk officially exited the european union and entered into a transition period to negotiate the final terms of brexit many potential future impacts of brexit remain unclear and could adversely impact certain areas of our business including but not limited to an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions in order to mitigate the risks associated

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operational and compliance and reporting risks the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options currency swaps and crosscurrency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities we also use forward or option contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries these foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2019  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 436 million or loss of approximately 449 million respectively consistent with the use of these contracts to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into interest rate swap and crosscurrency swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate risk from probable longterm debt issuances or crosscurrency debt at december 31 2019  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 47 million or unrealized loss of approximately 64 million respectively related to these contracts 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts at december 31 2019  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 17 million respectively related to these contracts

regional business summary

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint the competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchase practices towards ecommerce and other channels moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings optimizing our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets we own and the licenses we hold in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the m ost important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid and amana t he most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint and  ignis the most important trademarks to latin america are consul brastemp whirlpool   kitchenaid and acros  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool and  royalstar which is licensed to us we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid amana and  bauknecht  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs technologies and products 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2018  and is not expected to be material in 2019  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter government energy and environmental standards these standards have been and continue to be phased in over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy and related standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial statements arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements 

we have listed below what we believe to be the most significant strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks relating to our business 

strategic risks 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as those set forth in the business section of this annual report are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to global success   we also face competition that may be able to quickly adapt to changing consumer preferences particularly in the connected appliance space moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance industry is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as promotional funds sales incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home marketplaces outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies many of our competitors have established and may expand their presence in the rapidly changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and other channels if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance 

we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers including lowes and other large domestic and international trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an everincreasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance 

the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation generate free cash flow and drive shareholder value an inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profitability in addition an inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and other channels and on successful new product development including in the connected appliance space and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key product categories and geographic regions and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing environments 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant part and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands 

operational risks 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions or divestitures investments and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 and we signed an agreement to sell our embraco compressor business in 2018 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including 

that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and in overseeing the operations systems and controls of acquired companies for example in 2017 we recorded an adjustment primarily for trade promotion accruals by our china business which has been and remains subject to investigation by the relevant chinese governmental authorities we took certain remedial actions to strengthen internal controls as a result of our review of the conduct and processes involved integrating acquisitions and carving out divestitures is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products in addition liabilities may be retained by whirlpool when closing a facility divesting an entity or selling physical assets and such liabilities may be material 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies which noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs 

for the year ended december 31  2018  international operations represent approximately 49 of our net sales we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 



 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks cyber events armed conflicts civil unrest natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results 

we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers consumers and employees as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our business processes and data sharing across functions suppliers and vendors is dependent on information technology integration the failure of any systems whether internal or thirdparty during normal operation system upgrades implementations or connections could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other financial and business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and the personally identifiable data of consumers and employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as system application maintenance and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and personally identifiable information through system compromise or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be impacted by inappropriate or mistaken activity of parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers consumers employees thirdparties and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim product recall or other corrective action that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may be involved in class action litigation for which we generally have not purchased insurance and may be involved in certain other product recalls or other litigations or events for which insurance products may have limitations 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating certain potential quality and safety issues and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by us or the supplier and if borne by us whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance 

we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for certain disruptions may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue andor earnings performance 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth 

we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us in the case of talent losses significant time is required to hire develop and train skilled replacement personnel an inability to hire develop transfer retained knowledge engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business 

as of december 31  2018  we had approximately 92000  employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all all of which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results 

the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs labor costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances for example we experienced significant inflation in raw materials and certain manufactured components during 2018 which negatively impacted our operating results significant increases in these and other costs now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangible asset impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets primarily trademarks on our balance sheet we test the goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates ebit margins capital expenditures working capital requirements tax rates terminal growth rates discount rates royalty rates benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants declines in market conditions a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue for our trademarks a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time an increase in the marketbased weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates among other factors are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable we may be required to record a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

impairment of longlived assets may adversely affect our operating results 

our longlived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group the results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions our financial performance trends or an increase in interest rates among other factors if as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our longlived asset groups is less than its carrying amount we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we face inventory valuation risk 

we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

the current domestic and international political and economic environment are posing challenges to the industry in which we operate a number of economic factors including gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates currency controls inflation and deflation generally affect demand for our products 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen on or before december 31 2006 for substantially all participants since 2007 us employees have been eligible for an enhanced employer contribution under whirlpools defined contribution 401k plan 

as of december 31  2018  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and   welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 10 billion  including 06 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 04 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns health care cost trend rates and regulatory changes all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

legal  compliance risks 

unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and non–income taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters credit matters competition laws distribution marketing and trade practice matters anti–bribery and anti–corruption regulations energy regulations financial regulations and employment and benefit matters for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by brazilian authorities see note 7  and note 14  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial 

statements in any particular reporting period results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is cost effectively available regardless of merit legal and regulatory proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such proceedings could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image regardless of the existence or amount of liability we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust and productrelated laws and regulations violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment including changes in taxes and tariffs could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation 

the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising labeling safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in countries in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise   at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could also adversely affect us 

additionally as a global company based in the united states we are exposed to the impact of us tax changes especially those that affect the effective corporate income tax rate including the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act in addition the current domestic and international political environment including government shutdowns and changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy the us federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations these regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements and for additional information about global trade and tariffs please see other matters in the managements discussion and analysis section of this annual report on form 10k

this management discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included in this form 10k certain references to particular information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are made to assist readers 

overview 

whirlpool had a fullyear gaap net loss available to whirlpool of 183 million compared to gaap net earnings available to whirlpool of 350 million in the same prioryear period nonrecurring items negatively impacted fullyear net loss available to whirlpool by approximately 850 million including asset impairment charges related to the emea region and a settlement with the french competition authority fca 

whirlpool delivered ongoing nongaap ebit margin of 63 for the fullyear overcoming significant external challenges these results were driven by positive global pricemix and strong cost discipline which were offset by significant cost inflation and lower emea results in addition we delivered very strong cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow driven by sustainable working capital improvement and the timing of certain payments 

we are pleased with the successful execution of our costbased price increases delivering positive pricemix in all regions in addition we took strong actions to address the weaker than anticipated results in emea and offset significant cost and currency challenges 

we are confident that our strategy and actions will drive positive results in 2019 and remain committed to generating strong free cash flow and margin expansion

selling general and administrative 

the following table summarizes selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment 



consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2018  increased compared to 2017 due to expenses related to the bad debt expense from a brazilian retailer expenses related to the pending sale of the embraco compressor business and the negative impact of unit volume declines consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 remained flat compared to 2016  

restructuring 

we incurred restructuring charges of 247 million  275 million  and 173 million  for the years ended december 31  2018  2017  and 2016  respectively for the full year 2019 we expect to incur up to 100 million of restructuring charges as we reduce fixed costs primarily in the emea region 

for additional information about restructuring activities see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 

we recorded an impairment charge of 747 million related to goodwill 579 million and other intangibles 168 million for the twelve months ended   december 31 2018  related to the emea reporting unit 

for additional information see note 5  and note 10  to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this managements discussion and analysis 

interest and sundry income expense 

interest and sundry income expenses were 108 million  87 million  and 93 million  for the years ended december 31  2018  2017  and 2016  respectively interest and sundry income expense increase d 21 million  in 2018 compared to 2017  primarily due to the french competition authority fca settlement agreement partially offset by latin america tax credits and a favorable impact from foreign currency during 2017  interest and sundry income expense decrease d 6 million  compared to 2016  primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign currency 

interest expense 

interest expense was 192 million  162 million  and 161 million  for the years ended december 31  2018  2017  and 2016  respectively interest expense increased by  30 million  in 2018 compared to 2017  this was primarily due to higher average debt and notes payable balances and higher average interest rates during 2017  interest expense increase d by 1 million  compared to 2016 this was primarily due to higher average longterm debt balances 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 138 million  550 million  and 186 million  for the years ended december 31  2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in tax expense in 2018  compared to 2017  is primarily due to lower level of earnings the reduction in statutory us tax rate from 35 to 21 impact of non deductible goodwill impairments and government payment accruals valuation allowances and tax planning actions 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

the increase in tax expense in 2017  compared to 2016  is primarily due to the onetime charge of approximately 420 million as result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act including the impact from a reduced tax rate on the valuations of deferred tax assets the onetime deemed repatriation tax and other related items excluding the impact from tax reform the decrease in tax expense compared to 2016 is primarily due to increased tax planning benefits 

for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking perspective 

full year 2019 guidance measures of gaap earnings per diluted share and free cash flow do not reflect the anticipated gain on sale and in the case of free cash flow proceeds from the sale of the embraco compressor business the final amounts are subject to a number of variables that are subject to change including the net book value of held for sale assets closing costs taxes and customary adjustments for indebtedness cash and working capital at closing 

earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax while each adjustment is presented on a pretax basis the aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2019  fullyear tax rate between 15 and 20 we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2019  to be within the following ranges 



1 reflects industry demand in the united states 

2 reflects industry demand in brazil 

for the fullyear 2019  we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 14 billion to 15 billion and free cash flow of approximately 800 million to 900 million including restructuring cash outlays of up to 100 million and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of approximately 625 million 

the table below reconciles projected 2019  cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of whirlpool china formerly hefei sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance whirlpool chinas research and development and working capital as required by the terms of the hefei sanyo acquisition completed in october 2014  for additional information regarding nongaap financial measures see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures some of which we refer to as ongoing measures including 

 ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses ongoing ebit margin is calculated by dividing ongoing ebit by net sales for 2018 and ongoing net sales for 2017 ongoing net sales for 2017 excludes 32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we also disclose segment ebit which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry income expense and ongoing segment ebit as important financial metrics used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with asc 280  segment reporting the company provides free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as longterm management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap measure for these longterm goal metrics any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the companys control 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of our business because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to whirlpool net sales and cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

please refer to a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures below

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt and reduce liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and research and development spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities and returns to shareholders we also have 947 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options which may include repayment through refinancing free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

notes payable consists of shortterm borrowings payable to banks or commercial paper which are generally used to fund working capital requirements as of december 31 2018 we have 1034 million of notes payable outstanding which consists of shortterm borrowings payable to banks we have no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2018 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly and take certain action to manage credit risk we diversify our deposits and investments in shortterm cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in china and brazil which represented 32 and 14 respectively in addition we did not have any thirdparty accounts receivable greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of the united states with the exception of italy and mexico which represented 13 and 11 respectively we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 15 billion  at december 31 2018  of which substantially all was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes if any and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

we continue to review customer conditions globally as of december 31 2018 we had 286 million reais approximately 74 million in short and longterm receivables due to us from maquina de vendas sa in 2018 as part of their extrajudicial recovery plan we agreed to receive payment of our outstanding receivable plus interest over eight years under a tiered payment schedule as of december 31 2018 we have 127 million reais approximately 32 million of insurance against this credit risk through policies purchased from highquality underwriters 

on october 15 2018 sears holdings corporation sears announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection as of december 31 2018 we had an immaterial accounts receivable and inventory exposure related to sears we believe the sears bankruptcy will have a very limited shortterm impact on our results of operations as consumers adjust to the new retail landscape furthermore we do not believe that the bankruptcy will materially impact our financial results over the long term 

in the past when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network

we met our cash needs during 2018  through cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and financing arrangements our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31 2018  increased 245 million compared to the same period in 2017  

the following table summarizes the net increase decrease in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2018  are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2018  primarily reflects 350 million of discretionary pension funding partially offset by the working capital impact from inventory reduction efforts lower volumes and credit management activities net loss includes the noncash impacts from impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2017 was primarily driven by effective credit management improvement in working capital and lower cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action partially offset by lower net earnings 

cash provided by operating activities in 2016 reflects strong cash earnings and effective credit management and the impact of cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018  primarily reflects a decrease in capital expenditures approximately 95 million proceeds from a real estate saleleaseback transaction approximately 130 million and the proceeds related to heldtomaturity securities approximately 60 million 

the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures approximately 25 million and the net impact of purchases approximately 170 million and proceeds approximately 110 million related to heldtomaturity securities

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and other governmental obligations and debt agreements as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had approximately 355 million  and 407 million  outstanding under these agreements respectively 

for additional information about our offbalance sheet arrangements see note 1 and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2018  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2019  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2018  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2018  retirement obligations and 2019  retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards general business credits and deductible temporary differences will be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had total deferred tax assets of 29 billion  net of valuation allowances of 348 million  and 178 million  respectively our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see note 1  note 7  and note 14  to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized at december 31 2018 and 2017 we had goodwill of approximately 25 billion and 31 billion respectively we have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately 19 billion and 20 billion as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets is below the carrying amount we may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative assessments performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible actual and projected revenue and ebit margin relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible is less than its carrying value 

for our annual impairment assessment as of october 1 2018 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks the company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinitelife intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment 

during the second quarter of 2018 we identified impairment indicators for the goodwill in our emea reporting unit and the indesit  and hotpoint  trademarks based on our qualitative assessment which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment 

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value primarily by using the income approach the income approach uses each reporting units projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital the financial projections reflect managements best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth ebit margin tax rate capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units we also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations 

interim impairment assessment 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated condensed financial statements for the three months ended june 30 2018 we identified indicators of goodwill impairment for our emea reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment the primary indicator of 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

impairment for our emea reporting unit was the segments continuing negative financial performance in 2018 that did not improve as anticipated primarily driven by significant volume loss the actual operating results for the threemonths ended june 30 2018 were significantly lower than forecasted resulting in weak business performance while the indesit integration activities were substantially complete as of the interim impairment date the operating and macroenvironment in the emea region continued to be very challenging and had not improved as anticipated while our commercial transformation and supply chain initiatives were progressing as of the impairment determination date progress on market share recovery was slower than previously anticipated and the business has been impacted by raw material inflation and currency headwinds 

in evaluating the emea reporting unit significant weight was provided to the forecasted ebit margins and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

the average 5year forecasted ebit margin in the discounted cash flow model was approximately 5 and the discount rate was 12 based on market participant assumptions 

based on our interim quantitative impairment assessment the carrying value of the emea reporting unit exceeded its fair value by 579 million and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of 2018 

annual impairment assessment 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2018 the fair values of our nar asia and lar reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 111 165 and 31 respectively 

based on the quantitative assessment performed for the emea reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 1 which was consistent with managements expectation given the short time period between our interim and annual impairment assessments the emea reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 300 million at december 31 2018 

in evaluating the emea reporting unit significant weight was provided to the forecasted ebit margins and discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

 

 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5 reduction in the projected ebit margins in the forecasted periods would result in an impairment charge of 278 million and 148 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

indefinitelife intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

interim impairment assessment 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated condensed financial statements for three months ended june 30 2018 we identified indicators of impairment associated with other intangible assets in our emea reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment which required us to complete an interim quantitative impairment assessment the primary indicator of impairment was the continuing decline in revenue from weaker volumes through the six months ended june 30 2018 that did not improve as anticipated the actual operating results for the three months ended june 30 2018 were significantly lower than forecasted 

in performing the quantitative analysis on these assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty method includes revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate 

we used a royalty rate and discount rate of 3 and 15 respectively for indesit and a royalty rate and discount rate of 35 and 155 respectively for hotpoint  

based on our interim quantitative impairment assessment the carrying value of certain other intangible assets including indesit  and hotpoint  exceeded their fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of 168 million during the second quarter of 2018 

annual impairment assessment 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2018 we determined there was an immaterial impairment as a result of the restructuring initiative to exit from domestic sales operations not including manufacturing operations in turkey there were no other impairments of indefinitelife intangible assets in 2018 

the fair value of the indesit  trademark exceeded its carrying value of 220 million by less than 1 the fair value of the hotpoint  trademark approximated its carrying value of 155 million we expect revenue trends for both these brands to improve as we stabilize volumes recover market share and benefit from our new product investments in the emea region 

the fair value of the maytag  trademark exceeded its carrying value of 1021 million by approximately 2 we expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we recover temporary volume loss from previously announced costbased price increases and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments 

the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 

in performing the quantitative assessment on these assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty model included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues in the indesit  hotpoint and maytag  trademarks would result in an impairment charge of approximately 23 million 23 million and 81 million respectively 

in determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of trademarks the most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in the given market segment based on this analysis we determined a royalty rate of 3 35 and 4 for our indesit  hotpoint  and maytag  trademarks respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for indesit  hotpoint  and maytag  noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rates from each brand would result in an impairment charge of approximately 35 million 46 million and 106 million respectively 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined the discount rates to be 15 155 and 10 for indesit  hotpoint  and maytag  respectively we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for indesit  hotpoint  and maytag  noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately 17 million 17 million and 101 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

for additional information about goodwill and indefinitelife intangible valuations see note 5 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance economic conditions market conditions and cost of capital inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control such as changes in capital markets the actual cash flows could differ materially from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions operating performance and economic conditions

antidumping and safeguard petition 

as previously reported whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that samsung lg and electrolux violated us and international trade laws by dumping washers into the us those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain washers imported from south korea mexico and china and countervailing duties on certain washers from south korea these orders could be subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals the south korea and mexico orders are currently being reviewed to determine whether the orders should continue to remain in effect for another five years 

whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in may 2017 to address our concerns that samsung and lg are evading us trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders a safeguard remedy went into effect in february 2018 implementing tariffs on finished washers and certain covered parts for three years during the second year of the remedy beginning february 7 2019 the remedy imposes an 18 tariff on the first 12 million large residential 

washing machines imported into the united states and a 45 tariff on such imports in excess of 12 million and also imposes a 45 tariff on washer tub drum and cabinet imports in excess of 70000 units the tariff rates on washers 

and covered parts will decline slightly during the third year of the remedy the safeguard remedy will be subject to an interim review by the international trade commission during 2019

us tariffs and global economy 

the current domestic and international political environment including existing and potential changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy the impact of previouslyannounced us tariffs on steel and aluminum was a component of increased raw material costs during the year ended december 31 2018  we expect these and other tariffs to impact material costs in future quarters which could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operational and compliance and reporting risks the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities we also use forward or option contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2018  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 234 million or loss of approximately 241 million respectively consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2018  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 21 million respectively related to these contracts

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint the competitive environment includes the impact of a changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchase preferences towards ecommerce and other channels moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings expanding our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately  596 million  604 million  and 579 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets we own and the licenses we hold in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the m ost important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint hotpointariston and  ignis 

the most important trademarks to latin america are consul brastemp whirlpool  and kitchenaid  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool and  royalstar  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid amana and  bauknecht  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2017  and is not expected to be material in 2018  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter government energy and environmental standards these standards have been and continue to be phased in over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy and related standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial statements arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

we have listed below the most significant strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks relating to our business 

strategic risks 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance 

each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to global success moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance industry is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home marketplaces outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies many of our competitors have established and may expand their presence in the rapidly changing retail environment including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and other channels if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance 

we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including an increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance 

the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation generate free cash flow and drive shareholder value our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profitability in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences including the shifting of consumer purchasing practices towards ecommerce and other channels and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key product categories and geographic regions and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing environments 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant part and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands 

operational risks 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions investments and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and managing strategic investments and in overseeing the operations systems and controls of acquired companies for example in 2017 we recorded an adjustment primarily for trade promotion accruals by our china business and took certain actions as a result of our review of the conduct and processes involved integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all 

of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies which noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs 

for the year ended december 31  2017  international operations represent approximately 52 of our net sales we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts civil unrest natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results 

we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers consumers and employees as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency our business processes and data sharing across functions suppliers and vendors is dependent on information technology integration the failure of any systems whether internal or thirdparty during normal operation system upgrades implementations or connections could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other financial and business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and the personally identifiable data of consumers and employees 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as system application maintenance and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property and personally identifiable information through system compromise or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be impacted by inappropriate or mistaken activity of parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers consumers employees thirdparties and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim product recall or other corrective action that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available a cost effective market for product recall insurance may not exist so any product recall we initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by us or the supplier and if borne by us whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance 

we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue andor earnings performance 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth 

we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us in the case of talent losses significant time is required to hire develop and train skilled replacement personnel an inability to hire develop transfer retained knowledge engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business 

as of december 31  2017  we had approximately 92000  employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have four to five year terms as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all all of which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

financial risks 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results 

the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs labor costs government regulations such as conflict mineral provisions and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances for example we experienced significant raw material inflation during 2017 which negatively impacted our operating results significant increases in these and other costs now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangible asset impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets primarily trademarks on our balance sheet we test the goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates operating margins capital expenditures working capital requirements tax rates terminal growth rates discount rates royalty rates benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants declines in market conditions a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue for our trademarks a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time an increase in the marketbased weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates among other factors are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable we may be required to record a goodwill or intangible asset impairment charge that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

impairment of longlived assets may adversely affect our operating results 

our longlived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group the results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions our financial performance trends or an increase in interest rates among other factors if as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our longlived asset groups is less than its carrying amount we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we face inventory valuation risk 

we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy 

uncertain and changing economic conditions within our regions along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which we operate a number of economic factors including gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates currency controls inflation and deflation generally affect demand for our products 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen on or before december 31 2006 for substantially all participants since 2007 us employees have been eligible for an enhanced employer contribution under whirlpools defined contribution 401k plan 

as of december 31  2017  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 14 billion  including 10 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 04 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns health care cost trend rates and regulatory changes all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

legal  compliance risks 

unfavorable results of legal and regulatory proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices antibribery anticorruption energy regulations financial regulations and employment and benefit matters for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities see notes 5  and 12  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is cost effectively available regardless of merit such proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations such proceedings could also generate significant adverse publicity and have a negative impact on our reputation and brand image regardless of the existence or amount of liability we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss 

contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties 

we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust and productrelated laws and regulations violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment including changes in taxes and tariffs could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation 

the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising labeling safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in countries in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

additionally as a global company based in the united states we are exposed to the impact of us tax changes especially those that affect the effective corporate income tax rate in addition to the changes recently enacted in the tax cuts and jobs act the us federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements tariffs taxes and other government rules and regulations at december 31 2017 the company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act however in certain cases the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and impact of the onetime transition tax the tax expense recognized represents the companys best estimate of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act during 2018 the company will continue to refine the calculations related to both provisional amounts as it gains a more thorough understanding of the tax law and certain aspects of the tax cuts and jobs act are clarified by the taxing authorities these regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements

overview 

whirlpool corporation delivered record revenues and the second highest year ever in terms of ongoing earnings per share in 2017 these results were solid but we committed to delivering better results and the challenges we faced caused us to revise our outlook throughout the year 

we experienced significant raw material inflation during the year particularly resins which turned into a 600 million challenge for 2017 and 2018 combined our results were also impacted by slow progress on european and china integration activities these two combined factors led to a performance shortfall against our targets 

to offset these challenges we have taken strong and decisive actions we implemented costbased price increases across the majority of our business effective early 2018 and have committed to a net fixed cost reduction of 150 million which is already over 80 percent implemented we firmly believe these are the right actions and that we have the right strategy to deliver improved performance in 2018 and our longterm goals

restructuring 

we incurred restructuring charges of 275 million  173 million  and 201 million  for the years ended december 31  2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for the full year 2018 we expect to incur up to 200 million of restructuring charges which should result in ongoing substantial cost reductions 

for additional information about restructuring activities see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements 

interest and sundry income expense 

interest and sundry income expenses were 87 million  93 million  and 46 million  for the years ended december 31  2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the interest and sundry income expense decrease d 6 million  in 2017 compared to 2016  primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign currency during 2016  interest and sundry income expense increase d 47 million  compared to 2015  primarily due to the reclassification of certain components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and postretirement benefits 

for additional information about the retrospective presentation and impact of net periodic benefit cost see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expenses were 162 million  161 million  and 165 million  for the years ended december 31  2017  2016  and 2015  respectively interest expense increased by  1 million  in 2017 compared to 2016  this was primarily due to higher average longterm debt balances during 2016  interest expense decreased  by 4 million  compared to 2015 this was a result of lower average interest rates on longterm debt offset by higher average longterm debt balances

forwardlooking perspective 

earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax while each adjustment is presented on a pretax basis the aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2018  fullyear tax rate in the mid 20s we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2018  to be within the following ranges 



1 reflects industry demand in the united states 

2 reflects industry demand in brazil 

for the fullyear 2018  we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 17 billion to 18 billion  and free cash flow of approximately 10 billion  to 11 billion  including primarily acquisition related restructuring cash outlays of up to 300 million  pension contributions of 34 million  and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of approximately 675 million  

the table below reconciles projected 2018  cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance whirlpool chinas research and development and working capital as required by the terms of the hefei sanyo acquisition completed in october 2014  for additional information regarding nongaap financial measures see the nongaap financial measures section of managements discussion and analysis 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

nongaap financial measures 

we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures some of which we refer to as ongoing measures including 

 ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses ongoing ebit margin is calculated by dividing ongoing ebit by ongoing net sales ongoing net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 excludes 32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the companys ability to fund its activities and obligations the company provides free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as longterm management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap measure for these longterm goal metrics any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the companys control 

we believe that these nongaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap financial measures provide a more complete understanding of our business because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to whirlpool net sales and cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

please refer to a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures below

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt we avoid concentrations of debt and reduce liquidity risk by diversifying the maturity structure we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities funding pension plans and returns to shareholders we also have 376 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options which may include repayment through refinancing free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly and take certain action to manage credit risk we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in china and brazil which represented 27 and 11 respectively in addition we did not have any thirdparty accounts receivable greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of north america we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 12 billion  at december 31 2017  of which substantially all was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states

taxes if any and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2017  through cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and financing arrangements our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  increased 111 million  compared to the same period in 2016  

the following table summarizes the net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2017  are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2017  is primarily driven by effective credit management improvement in working capital and lower cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action partially offset by lower net earnings 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017  primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures the net impact of purchases and proceeds related to held to maturity securities and investment in related businesses 

in june 2016 whirlpool china co ltd whirlpool china our majorityowned indirect subsidiary entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two whirlpool china plants in hefei china to a division of the hefei municipal government the aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately rmb 687 million approximately 103 million as of june 27 2016 whirlpool china received rmb 280 million approximately 42 million in 2016 and we received payments totaling rmb 280 million in 2017 with the remainder to be paid in 2018 the remaining balance is rmb 127 million approximately 19 million as of december 31 2017  

cash flows from financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017  primarily reflects share repurchase activity repayments of longterm debt and dividend payments partially offset by net proceeds from longterm and shortterm debt cash used in financing activities during 2016  primarily reflects share repurchase activity and repayments of longterm debt cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily reflects share repurchase activity

whirlpool subsidiary share repurchase 

on july 12 2016 whirlpool sa whr sa and brasmotor sa bmt both majorityowned indirect subsidiaries of whirlpool corporation issued public announcements in brazil reporting that whirlpool do brasil ltda the controlling shareholder of both whr sa and bmt intended to acquire the outstanding common and preferred shares of whr sa and bmt by means of tender offers for the publiclyheld shares at that time whirlpool do brasil ltda and other whirlpool entities held 9920 of the common and 9568 of the preferred shares of whr sa and 9940 of the common and 9355 of the preferred shares of bmt the tender offers were launched in november 2016 and concluded in december 2016 the offer for bmt was successful and the squeezeout was completed in january 2017 at a total cost of approximately 31 million the whr sa tender offer was abandoned because the minimum number of interested minority shareholders was not obtained 

financing arrangements 

the company had total committed credit facilities of approximately 36 billion as of december 31 2017  which increased by 500 million from december 31 2016  due primarily to an increase under the amended longterm facility entered into during the third quarter of 2017 the facilities reflect the companys growing global operations the company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations we had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively 

for additional information about our financing arrangements see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and other governmental obligations and debt agreements as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had approximately 407 million  and 327 million  outstanding under these agreements respectively 

for additional information about our offbalance sheet arrangements see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2017  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2018  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2017  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2017  retirement obligations and 2018  retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards general business credits and deductible temporary differences that are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had total deferred tax assets of 29 billion  and 32 billion  respectively net of valuation allowances of 178 million  and 150 million  respectively our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from 68 million in 2013 to  550 million  in the current year the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1  5  and 12  to the consolidated financial statements 

legacy product corrective action reserves 

in the normal course of business we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted 

as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two  of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit these dryer production platforms were developed prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign was undertaken to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint  and indesit  brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit produced 

during the third quarter of 2017 the corrective action was substantially complete and any remaining charges related to the action will be recorded under product warranty in the twelve months ended december 31 2017  whirlpool had 61 million of cash settlements made related to the corrective action

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets primarily trademark assets which are not amortized at december 31 2017 and 2016 we had goodwill of approximately 31 billion and 30 billion respectively we primarily have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately 26 billion as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative assessments performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible actual and projected revenue and operating margin relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelife intangible is less than its carrying value 

in 2017 the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and primarily perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinitelife intangible assets 

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value under an income approach using a discounted cash flow model the income approach uses each reporting units projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weightedaverage cost of capital the financial projections reflect managements best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth operating margins tax rate capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the fair value estimate using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting units operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether it is reasonable based on other recent market transactions 

based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment conducted on october 1 2017 the fair values of our north america latin america and asia reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values in a range of 72 to 183 

based on the quantitative assessment performed the fair value of the emea reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3 the emea reporting unit has goodwill of 09 billion at december 31 2017 primarily related to our acquisition of indesit during the fourth quarter of 2014 

in evaluating the emea reporting unit significant weight was provided to the forecasted operating margins and discount rate as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5 reduction in the projected operating profit in each forecasted period would result in an impairment charge of approximately 86 million or 98 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions a material impairment charge of our goodwill could occur which could have an adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

indefinitelife intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinitelife intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our longrange plans assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate using a market based weightedaverage cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelife intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

based on the quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2017 an impairment of our diqua  trademark was determined to exist primarily driven by a significant decrease in the revenue projections due to a change in our brand strategy this resulted in an impairment charge of 8 million which reduced the carrying value of this trademark to 31 million there were no other impairments of indefinitelife intangible assets in 2017 

the fair value of the indesit  and hotpoint  trademarks exceeded their carrying value by approximately 4 and 8 respectively for the indesit  and hotpoint  trademarks we expect revenue trends for these brands to improve as we continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments 

the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 

in performing the quantitative analysis on these trademark assets significant assumptions used in our relieffromroyalty model included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below

antidumping and safeguard petition 

as previously reported in response to our december 2011 petition the us department of commerce doc issued a final determination in 2013 that samsung and lg violated us and international trade laws by dumping washers from south korea and mexico into the us and antidumping duties are now imposed on certain washers imported from south korea and mexico rather than comply with the 2013 order samsung and lg moved their washer production to china samsung and lg resumed dumping washers into the us and whirlpool responded in 2015 by filing a new antidumping petition against their imports the doc issued a final determination in 2016 that samsung and lg violated us and international trade laws by dumping washers from china into the us as a result of these decisions certain washers imported from china are now subject to antidumping duties set by the doc as in the case of our december 2011 petition the doc and international trade commission itc decisions could be followed by administrative review procedures and possible appeals over the next several years 

in may 2017 we filed a safeguard petition with the itc to address our concerns that samsung and lg are evading us trade laws by moving production from countries south korea mexico and china covered by existing doc antidumping duties in contrast to the countryspecific antidumping remedy that the us government applied to samsung and lg in south korea mexico and china a safeguard remedy can address imports from samsung and lg from any country that causes injury to us washer manufacturers in october 2017 the itc determined increased washer imports were a substantial cause of serious injury to the us washer industry and made a remedy recommendation to the us president to address past harm and prevent future injury in january 2018 the president signed a remedy order that took effect on february 7 2018 effective for three years in the first year the presidents remedy order imposes a 20 tariff on the first 12 million large residential washing machines imported by samsung and lg and a 50 tariff on such imports in excess of 12 million the presidents remedy order also imposes a 50 tariff on washer tub drum and cabinet imports covered parts in excess of 50000 units annually the tariff rates on washers and covered parts decline slightly during the second and third years of the remedy

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operational and compliance and reporting risks the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities we also use forward or option contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2017  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 233 million or loss of approximately 237 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2017  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 27 million respectively related to these contracts

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

in asia we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances and small domestic appliances into five operating groups 1 mainland china 2 hong kong and taiwan 3 india which includes bangladesh sri lanka nepal and pakistan 4 oceania which includes australia new zealand and pacific islands and 5 southeast asia which includes thailand singapore malaysia indonesia vietnam the philippines korea myanmar and japan we market and distribute our products in asia primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  amana  bauknecht  jennair  diqua and royalstar  brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through fullservice distributors to a large network of retail stores 

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings expanding our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets we own and the licenses we hold in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to latin america are  consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint   hotpointariston and  ignis  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool royalstar and diqua  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately  604 million  579 million  and 563 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2016  and is not expected to be material in 2017  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

overview 

during 2016 we had another year of strong performance for whirlpool corporation as we delivered record results through strong operational execution and decisive actions to adjust to changes in global markets 

over the last few years macroeconomic volatility has been a factor in many of the countries where we operate we continued to experience volatility during 2016 the brexit decision in june had a negative impact on british currency and demand while uncertainty in emerging markets generated additional currency and demand weakness especially in brazil russia and china 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

these challenges along with a further strengthening us dollar had a combined negative impact of approximately 600 million in revenue and 2 per share of earnings 

our earnings growth and strong cash generation enabled us to create longterm shareholder value through the execution of our balanced capital allocation approach we invested in our innovation pipeline through 660 million in capital expenditures while increasing our dividend by 11 and repurchasing 525 million in common stock these investments continue to be supported by a strong balance sheet an increased capacity to invest and the confidence that our operating plans will deliver extraordinary levels of shareholder value both now and in the future 

our longterm value creation framework is built upon the strong foundation we have in place our industryleading brand portfolio and robust product innovation pipeline supported by our best cost global operating platform and executed by our exceptional employees throughout the world we will measure these valuecreation components by focusing on the following key metrics 

 we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business regardless of the operating environment and expect to continue delivering longterm value for all of our shareholders

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2016  and 2015  compared to the previous years reflect the favorable impact of acquisition synergies partially offset by foreign currency 

restructuring 

we incurred restructuring charges of 173 million  201 million  and 136 million  for the years ended december 31  2016  2015  and 2014  respectively for the full year 2017 we expect to incur up to 200 million of restructuring charges which will result in ongoing substantial cost reductions 

additional information about restructuring activities can be found in note 10  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest and sundry income expense 

interest and sundry income expense decrease d 10 million  compared to 2015  primarily due to amounts received pursuant to an agreement reached in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the seller of indesit to recover a portion of our acquisition related costs during 2015  interest and sundry income expense decrease d 53 million  compared to 2014  primarily due to a 64 million  gain related to a business investment in brazil during 2015  and previous year investment expenses related to the hefei sanyo and indesit acquisitions partially offset by impact from foreign currency 

for additional information about the embraco antitrust matters and legacy product warranty cost see note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  see the financial condition and liquidity section of managements discussion and analysis 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by  4 million  compared to 2015  this was a result of lower average interest rates on longterm debt offset by higher average longterm debt balances during 2015  interest expense was unchanged compared to 2014  this was a result of higher average longterm debt balances offset by lower average interest rates on longterm debt 

income taxes 

income tax expenses were 186 million  209 million  and 189 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in tax expense in 2016  compared to 2015  is primarily due to favorable audits and settlements and tax planning resulting in valuation allowance releases partially offset by higher pretax earnings the increase in tax expense in 2015  compared to 2014  is primarily due to higher pretax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate

forwardlooking perspective 

earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax while each adjustment is presented on a pretax basis the aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2017  fullyear tax rate of 22  we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2017  to be within the following ranges 



1 reflects industry demand in the united states 

2 reflects industry demand in brazil 

for the fullyear 2017  we expect to generate cash from operating activities of 17 billion  to 175 billion  and free cash flow of approximately 1 billion  including primarily acquisition related restructuring cash outlays of up to 165 million  legacy product warranty and liability costs of 69 million  pension contributions of 42 million  and with respect to free cash flow capital expenditures of 700 million  to 750 million  

the table below reconciles projected 2017  cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance whirlpool china’s research and development and working capital as required by the terms of the hefei sanyo acquisition made in october 2014 



1 financial guidance on a gaap basis for cash provided by used in financing activities and cash provided by used in investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection the company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control 

the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities funding pension plans and returns to shareholders we also have 560 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt which may include repayment through refinancing through free cash flow generation or cash on hand 

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly and take certain action to manage credit risk we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

as of december 31 2016  the only country where we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets was china which represented 24 in addition we did not have any thirdparty accounts receivable greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of north america with the exceptions of italy china and brazil which represented 10 10 and 13 respectively we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally 

as of december 31 2016  we had €67 million  approximately 71 million  as of december 31 2016  in outstanding trade receivables and shortterm and longterm notes due to us associated with alno ag a longstanding european customer approximately €49 million  approximately 51 million  as of december 31 2016  of the outstanding receivables were overdue as of december 31 2016  our exposure includes not only the outstanding receivables but also the potential risks of an alno ag bankruptcy and impacts to our distribution process we believe our reserves related to these outstanding receivables are sufficient in the fourth quarter of 2016 whirlpool sold its remaining investment of approximately 106 million shares in alno ag for approximately €5 million approximately 6 million we continue to monitor customer financial conditions globally 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 11 billion  at december 31 2016  of which approximately 10 billion  was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2016  through cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and financing arrangements our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016  increased 313 million  compared to the same period in 2015    

the following table summarizes the net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2016  are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

cash flows from operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2016  reflects strong cash earnings and effective credit management more than offset by cash expenditures related to the legacy product corrective action 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements credit management as well as receivable and payment terms depending on the timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

changes in cash used in investing activities during 2016  primarily reflect a reduction in capital expenditures and investment in related businesses partially offset by increased proceeds from the sale of business assets 

in june 2016 whirlpool china co ltd “whirlpool china” our majorityowned indirect subsidiary entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two whirlpool china plants in hefei china to a division of the hefei municipal government the aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately rmb 687 million approximately 103 million as of june 27 2016 whirlpool china received rmb 280 million approximately 42 million as of june 27 2016 of the aggregate return price on june 27 2016 with the remainder to be paid in installments in 2017 and 2018 the remaining balance is rmb 407 million   approximately 59 million  as of december 31 2016  

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2016  primarily reflects share repurchase activity and repayments of longterm debt cash used in financing activities during 2015  primarily reflects share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program cash provided by financing activities during 2014 primarily reflects funding required to complete the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit 

whirlpool subsidiary share repurchase 

on july 12 2016 whirlpool sa “whr sa” and brasmotor sa “bmt” both majorityowned indirect subsidiaries of whirlpool corporation issued public announcements in brazil reporting that whirlpool do brasil ltda the controlling shareholder of both whr sa and bmt intended to acquire the outstanding common and preferred shares of whr sa and bmt by means of tender offers for the publiclyheld shares at that time whirlpool do brasil ltda and other whirlpool entities held 9920 of the common and 9568 of the preferred shares of whr sa and 9940 of the common and 9355 of the preferred shares of bmt the tender offers were launched in november 2016 and concluded in december 2016 the offer for bmt was successful and will result in the acquisition of 100 of the shares of bmt after the squeezeout of the remaining minority shareholders the cost related to this offer was approximately 25 million as of december 2016 the squeezeout was completed in january 2017 bringing the total cost to approximately 31 million the whr sa tender offer was abandoned because the minimum number of interested minority shareholders was not obtained

whirlpool china acquisition 

on august 12 2013  whirlpools whollyowned subsidiary whirlpool china investment co ltd reached agreements to acquire a 51  equity stake in hefei sanyo  a joint stock company whose shares are listed and traded on the shanghai stock exchange this transaction was completed on october 24 2014  hefei sanyo  has since been renamed to whirlpool china co ltd the aggregate purchase price was rmb 34 billion  approximately 551 million  at the dates of purchase the company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand the cash paid for the private placement portion of the transaction is considered restricted cash which is used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance whirlpool china’s research and development and working capital as required by the terms of the hefei sanyo acquisition made in october 2014   

we expect the acquisition will accelerate whirlpools profitable growth in china during 2014 whirlpool began integrating the manufacturing administrative supply chain and technology operations of hefei sanyo  the results of hefei sanyo ’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning october 24 2014  

hefei sanyo  has an established and broad distribution network that includes a very large number of distribution outlets throughout china its significant presence in rural areas complements whirlpool’s presence in china’s highertier cities with this acquisition whirlpool also gained manufacturing scale and a competitive cost structure in the city of hefei the ability to consolidate operations offers strong synergies as whirlpool will provide extensive technical marketing and product development combined with hefei sanyo ’s sales execution and operational strengths to support the next phase of development in the advancement of whirlpool china  as an important global production and research and development center for the home appliance sector 

indesit acquisition 

on december 3 2014  whirlpool completed the final step in its acquisition of indesit total consideration paid for indesit was € 11 billion  approximately 14 billion  at the dates of purchase of each step in the transaction in aggregate net of cash acquired the company funded the aggregate purchase price for indesit through borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper programs and repaid a portion of such borrowings through the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of 650 million  in senior notes on november 4 2014  and an aggregate principal amount of € 500 million  approximately 525 million  as of the date of issuance in senior notes on march 12 2015  

this transaction has built whirlpool’s market position within europe and we believe will continue to enable sustainable growth given the complementary market positions product offerings and distribution channels of whirlpool and indesit  throughout europe we expect efficiencies in rd capital spending and value chain costs as well as operational scale with increased volume and the ability to more effectively integrate our product platforms the results of indesit ’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning october 14 2014

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have guarantee arrangements in a brazilian subsidiary as a standard business practice in brazil the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies if a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the guaranteed amounts totaled 258 million  and 260 million  respectively the fair value of these guarantees were nominal at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters we had no  losses associated with these guarantees in 2016  or 2015  

we have guaranteed a 40 million   five year revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a notforprofit entity in connection with a community and economic development project “harbor shores” the credit facility which originated in 2008 was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 it was also amended in 2015 and reduced from 43 million  to 40 million  by harbor shores in 2016 the fair value of this guarantee was nominal at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had approximately 327 million  and 290 million  outstanding under these agreements respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

  pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2016  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2017  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2016  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2016  retirement obligations and 2017  retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years’ financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences that are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had total deferred tax assets of 32 billion  and 33 billion  respectively net of valuation allowances of 150 million  and 286 million  respectively our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from 133 million in 2012 to  186 million  in the current year the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1  6  and 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

legacy product corrective action reserves 

in the normal course of business we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted 

as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two  of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit these dryer production platforms were developed prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint  and indesit  brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit produced 

as of   december 31 2016  whirlpool had 162 million of cash expenditures related to the corrective action we expect the corrective action affecting these dryers to have future cash expenditures in 2017 of 69 million  

 for additional information about the legacy product corrective action see note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and other intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill primarily whirlpools trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinitelife intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2016  we had goodwill of approximately 30 billion  there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for the impact of foreign currency   we primarily have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a total carrying value of approximately 26 billion  as of december 31 2016  

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1 st  and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

in 2016 the company primarily elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinitelife intangible assets

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value using the income approach the income approach uses operating segments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions the projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales costs and number of units estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements the estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying values 

whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values of fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactions 

if actual results are not consistent with managements’ estimate and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

based on the results of our quantitative assessment conducted on october 1 2016 the fair values of whirlpools reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values the range by which the excess fair value of our reporting units goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 4 to 142 the emea reporting unit has excess fair value of 4 during the fourth quarter 2014 whirlpool acquired indesit resulting in substantially all of the goodwill included in this reporting unit the range by which the excess fair value of our remaining reporting units goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 70 to 142 

other intangible valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

three trademarks acquired in fourth quarter of 2014 have fair values that exceed their carrying values by less than 10 the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 with the exception of one north american trademark 

the fair value of this north american trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately 1 billion by 6 in 2016  and 5 in 2015  we expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we continue to execute specific brand investments and product development plans additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues a 50 basis point decrease in royalty rate or a 50 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an impairment ranging from approximately 22 million to 78 million 

if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions trademarks or other indefinitelife intangible assets may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the company’s financial results of operations 

based on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately 12 million  in 2014 

our assessment indicates no impairment of any trademarks as of december 31 2016

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operation and compliance and reporting risk the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2016  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 125 million or loss of approximately 145 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2016  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 30 million respectively related to these contracts

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our regional footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to latin america are  consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint  whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint  brand sold in the americas  hotpointariston and  ignis  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool royalstar and diqua  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately  579 million  563 million  and 582 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2015  and is not expected to be material in 2016  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier lg panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy products 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us if our compliance policies including the requirement to comply with all laws are not followed such noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hefei sanyo  and indesit  acquisitions 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2015  we derived approximately 50 of our net sales from outside of north america including 16 in latin america 27 in emea and 7 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

• political legal and economic instability and uncertainty 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• changes in foreign tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax laws 

• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships including sanctions resulting from the current political situation in russia and ukraine 

• inflation 

• changes in foreign country regulatory requirements 

• various importexport restrictions and the availability of required importexport licenses 

• imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the fcpa and antitrust laws 

• work stoppages and labor relations 

• disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products 

• government price controls 

• extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable and 

• limitations on the repatriation or movement of earnings and cash 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

unfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities relating to befiex cfc tax and to ipi tax credits see note 7  and note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is likely available regardless of merit legal proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and drive shareholder value our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance therefore any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances currently we are implementing a corrective action plan affecting certain of our indesit and hotpoint branded dryers see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs 

from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face inventory and other asset risk we writedown product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain and changing economic conditions within our regions along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products 

economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states latin america europe china and the other areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in russia and ukraine may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 97000  employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees and may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2015  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately  15 billion   10 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and  05 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses

the charts below summarize the balance of net sales by reportable segment for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we monitor countryspecific economic factors such as gross domestic product unemployment consumer confidence retail trends housing starts and completions sales of existing homes and mortgage interest rates as key indicators of industry demand in addition to profitability we also focus on country brand product and channel sales when assessing and forecasting financial results 

our leading portfolio of brands includes whirlpool maytag kitchenaid embraco brastemp consul and  indesit  each of which generated annual revenues in excess of 1 billion our global branded consumer products strategy is to introduce innovative new products increase brand customer loyalty expand our presence outside the united states enhance our trade management platform improve total cost and quality by expanding and leveraging our global operating platform and where appropriate make strategic acquisitions and investments 

as we grow revenues in our core products our strategy is to extend our business by offering products and services that are dependent on and related to our core business and expand into adjacent products such as affresh cleaners   and  gladiator garageworks   through businesses that leverage our core competencies and business infrastructure 

overview 

whirlpool delivered strong results in 2015 driving revenue growth margin expansion and strong cash generation by leveraging our industry leading brand portfolio and innovative new products within our core appliance and adjacent businesses we achieved these results through strong focus and decisive action plans in a global environment that saw rapid emerging markets demand decline and strengthening of us dollar against most global currencies over the past year we made moves to reshape our global operating footprint respond to shifts in the operating environment and invest in our brands and products we made substantial progress toward integrating indesit in europe and hefei sanyo in china our 2014 acquisitions that create leading

positions as a western company in those markets we have great opportunities for growth as demand in the us continues to recover and we are very well positioned to capitalize when growth returns to emerging markets such as brazil china and russia 

we believe that continued execution of our business priorities and a focus on longterm growth will allow the company to adapt to changes in the macroeconomic environment and continue to create shareholder value

the following tables summarize units sold and consolidated net sales by operating segment 





nm not meaningful 

consolidated net sales increase d 51  compared to 2014  primarily driven by increased volume due to acquisitions and favorable product pricemix partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and a weakened demand environment in emerging markets excluding the impact of foreign currency consolidated net sales increased 181  compared to 2014  consolidated net sales for 2014   increase d 59  compared to 2013  primarily due to favorable product pricemix increased volume due to acquisitions partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower befiex credits excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits consolidated net sales for 2014   increased 84  compared to 2013  

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

we provide the percentage change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits as a supplement to the change in net sales as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to provide stockholders with a clearer basis to assess whirlpools results over time this measure is considered a nongaap financial measure and is calculated by translating the current period net sales excluding befiex credits in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales excluding befiex credits 

significant regional trends were as follows 

 we recognized approximately 0  14 million  and 109 million  of befiex credits in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively as of december 31 2015  approximately 34 million  of future cash monetization remained for court awarded fees which is not expected to be payable for several years for additional information regarding befiex credits see notes 7  and 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 gross margin 

the table below summarizes gross margin percentages by region 



the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 60  basis points to 177  compared to 2014  primarily due to ongoing cost productivity favorable product pricemix acquisition synergies and capacity optimization initiatives partially offset by foreign currency

 selling general and administrative 

the following table summarizes selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by region 



consolidated selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2015  remained flat compared to 2014  reflecting the favorable impact of acquisition synergies partially offset by foreign currency selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2014  increased compared to 2013  reflecting acquisitionrelated costs and investment expenses 

restructuring 

during 2014 and the twelve months ended   december 31 2015  we announced the following restructuring plans a the closure of a microwave oven manufacturing facility and other organizational efficiency actions in emea and latin america b organizational integration activities in china and europe to support the integration of the acquisitions of hefei sanyo which we have since renamed whirlpool china co ltd  whirlpool china  and indesit and c the closure of a research and development facility in germany in 2016 

in the second quarter of 2015 we committed to a restructuring plan to integrate our italian legacy operations with those of indesit the industrial restructuring plan which was approved by the relevant labor unions in july 2015 and signed by the italian government in august 2015 provides for the closure or repurposing of certain manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions at other facilities in addition the restructuring plan provides for headcount reductions in the salaried employee workforce 

we estimate that we will incur up to €179 million  approximately 194 million  as of december 31 2015  in employeerelated costs €25 million  approximately 27 million  as of december 31 2015  in asset impairment costs and €37 million  approximately 40 million  as of december 31 2015  in other associated costs in connection with these actions completion of these plans is expected by the end of 2018 we estimate €209 million  approximately 227 million  as of december 31 2015  of the estimated €241 million  total cost will result in future cash expenditures 

we incurred restructuring charges of 201 million  136 million  and 196 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

for the full year 2016 we expect to incur up to 200 million  of restructuring charges which will result in ongoing substantial cost reductions additional information about restructuring activities can be found in note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest and sundry income expense 

interest and sundry income expense decrease d 53 million  compared to 2014  primarily due to a 64 million  gain related to a business investment in brazil during the second quarter of 2015  and previous year investment expenses related to the hefei sanyo and indesit acquisitions during 2014  partially offset by impact from foreign currency during 2014  interest and sundry income expense decrease d 13 million  compared to 2013  primarily driven by lower charges related to embraco antitrust matters and a brazilian government settlement occurring in 2013  

for additional information about the embraco antitrust matters and the brazilian government settlement see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  see note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense was unchanged compared to 2014  this was a result of higher average longterm debt balances offset by lower average interest rates on longterm debt during 2014  interest expense decrease d 12 million  compared to 2013  primarily due to lower interest rates 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 209 million  189 million  and 68 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in tax expense in 2015  compared to 2014  is primarily due to higher pretax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 

the increase in tax expense in 2014  compared to 2013  is primarily due to the absence of united states energy tax credits recognized in 2013  

 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed in january 2013 reinstated the energy tax credit for 2012 and 2013  and resulted in a tax credit benefit related to the production of qualifying appliances in 2012 and 2013  in the combined amount of 126 million  all of which was recognized in 2013  for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes the difference between income tax expense at the united states statutory rate of 35  and the income tax expense at effective worldwide tax rates for the respective periods

forwardlooking perspective 

we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2016  to be within the following ranges 

1 primarily reflects industry demand in brazil   

for the fullyear 2016  we expect to generate free cash flow between 700 million  and 800 million  including restructuring cash outlays of up to 200 million  capital expenditures of 700 million  to 750 million  and emea legacy product warranty costs of 155 million 

the table below reconciles projected 2016  cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance whirlpool china’s research and development and working capital 



the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

on october 24 2014  whirlpools whollyowned subsidiary completed its acquisition of a 51  equity stake in whirlpool china  the aggregate purchase price for the transaction was rmb 34 billion  approximately 551 million  at the dates of purchase for each step of the transaction the company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand the cash paid for the private placement step of the transaction is considered restricted cash which is used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance whirlpool china’s research and development and working capital   additional information about the transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in july 2015 whirlpool china suspended trading of its stock pursuant to listing rules of the shanghai stock exchange in connection with its response to a notification from chinas securities regulatory agency to all listed companies aimed at addressing volatility in chinas securities market in december 2015 whirlpool china resumed trading of its stock in accordance with relevant chinese laws and the shanghai stock exchanges listing rules 

on december 3 2014  whirlpool completed the final step in its acquisition of indesit total consideration paid for indesit was € 11 billion  approximately 14 billion  at the dates of purchase of each step in the transaction in aggregate net of cash acquired the company funded the aggregate purchase price for indesit through borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper programs and repaid a portion of such borrowings through the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of 650 million  in senior notes on november 4 2014  and an aggregate principal amount of € 500 million  approximately 525 million  as of the date of issuance in senior notes on march 12 2015  additional information about the transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities funding pension plans and returns to shareholders we also have 508 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months 

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly in addition we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

we continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally as of december 31 2015  the only country where we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1 of our consolidated assets was china which represented 19 in addition we did not have any thirdparty accounts receivable greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of north america with the exception of italy which represented 15 

we also continue to review customer conditions across the eurozone as of december 31 2015  we had €79 million  approximately 86 million  as of december 31 2015  in outstanding trade receivables and shortterm and longterm notes due to us associated with alno ag a longstanding european customer approximately €33 million  approximately 36 million  as of december 31 2015  of the outstanding receivables were overdue as of december 31 2015  in the fourth quarter of 2014 whirlpool and alno entered into an agreement to revise the previous standstill agreement to amend the payment terms of the overdue trade receivables the new agreement cured the violation of the prior agreement and alnos overdue balance remains due in full by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 our exposure includes not only the outstanding receivables but also the potential risks of an alno bankruptcy and impacts to our distribution process alno is proceeding to secure additional financing to improve its financial position 

in 2014 whirlpool sold shares held in alno ag which resulted in the conversion of our investment from the equity method of accounting to an available for sale investment due to our less than 20 overall investment in alno ag 

the company had cash and cash equivalents of 772 million  at december 31 2015  of which 726 million  was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation 

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2015  through cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and financing arrangements our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015  decreased 254 million  compared to the same period in 2014  significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2015  are discussed below

cash flow summary 



cash flows from operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2015  reflects strong cash earnings partially offset by changes in working capital and 72 million to fund our united states qualified pension plans 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements as well as receivable and payment terms depending on timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements 

cash flows from investing activities 

changes in cash used in investing activities primarily reflect capital investments in each year and the acquisitions of indesit and hefei sanyo  in 2014 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2015  primarily reflects share repurchase activity under our new share repurchase program cash provided by financing activities during 2014  primarily reflect funding required to complete the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit cash used in financing activities during 2013 primarily reflects share repurchase activity under our previous share repurchase program

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 



 whirlpool china acquisition 

on august 12 2013  whirlpools whollyowned subsidiary whirlpool china reached agreements to acquire a 51  equity stake in a leading home appliances manufacturer hefei sanyo  a joint stock company whose shares are listed and traded on the shanghai stock exchange this transaction was completed on october 24 2014  hefei sanyo  has since been renamed to whirlpool china co ltd the aggregate purchase price was rmb 34 billion  approximately 551 million  at the dates of purchase the company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand the cash paid for the private placement portion of the transaction is considered restricted cash which will be used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance whirlpool china’s research and development and working capital

further discussion of this transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have guarantee arrangements in a brazilian subsidiary as a standard business practice in brazil the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies if a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the guaranteed amounts totaled 260 million  and 492 million  respectively our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters we had no  losses associated with these guarantees in 2015  or 2014  

we have guaranteed a 43 million  fiveyear revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a notforprofit entity in connection with a community and economic development project “harbor shores” the credit facility which originated in 2008 was amended in 2015 by harbor shores and reduced to 43 million  was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 the fair value of the guarantee is nominal the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had approximately 290 million  and 401 million  outstanding under these agreements respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

  pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2015  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2016  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of december 31 2015  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2015  retirement obligations and 2016  retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years’ financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences that are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had total deferred tax assets of 33 billion  and 32 billion  respectively net of valuation allowances of 286 million  and 308 million  respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million in 2011 to the current year tax expense of  209 million  and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including remaining befiex credits business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1  7  and 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

befiex credits 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales as of december 31 2015  all befiex credits that were available to be monetized had been monetized for additional information regarding befiex credits see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

legacy product corrective action reserves 

in the normal course of business we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two  of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit these dryer production platforms were developed by indesit prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint  whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint  brand in emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint  brand sold in the americas and indesit  brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit produced 

in september 2015 we recorded a liability related to the corrective action we estimate the most probable pretax and after tax cost of the corrective action to be €245 million  and €196 million respectively approximately 274 million and 219 million respectively as of september 30 2015 based on certain tax deductibility assumptions 

approximately 90 of the affected units were manufactured by indesit prior to its acquisition by the company in october 2014 accordingly we increased the warranty liability as a purchase accounting adjustment in the opening balance sheet with a corresponding increase to goodwill of €210 million  approximately 235 million as of september 30 2015 during 2015 we recognized expenses of 39 million  related to legacy product corrective action on the heritage indesit product in europe the establishment of this liability is based on several assumptions such as customer response rate consumer options field repair costs inventory repair costs and timing of tax deductibility our experience with respect to these factors may cause our actual costs to differ significantly from our estimated costs in addition we intend to seek indemnity under the terms of the indesit acquisition agreements any amounts we recover from the seller would reduce our net costs 

we expect the corrective action affecting these dryers to have future cash expenditures in 2016 of approximately 155 million  with the remaining cash expenditures occurring in 2017 

 for additional information about the indesit corrective action see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinitelife intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2015  we had goodwill of approximately 30 billion  there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for goodwill resulting from the acquisitions and changes in purchase price allocations or the impact of foreign currency we have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a total carrying value of approximately 27 billion  as of december 31 2015  

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

in 2015 the company elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets   

many of the factors used in assessing fair values are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairments 

goodwill valuations 

in performing a quantitative assessment we estimate fair value using the best information available to us including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach the income approach uses operating 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

segments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions the projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales costs and number of units estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements the estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying values 

sensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactions 

if actual results are not consistent with managements’ estimate and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

based on the results of our quantitative assessment conducted on october 1 2015 the fair values of whirlpools operating segments continue to exceed their respective carrying values   the range by which the excess fair value of our operating segments goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 12 to 108 

intangible valuations 

when performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment loss 

two trademarks acquired in fourth quarter of 2014 have fair values that exceed their carrying values by less than 10 the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 with the exception of one north american trademark the fair value of this north american trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately 1 billion by 5 in 2014 and 2015 we expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we continue to execute specific brand investments and product development plans our assessment indicates no impairment as of december 31 2015 

we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues a 50 basis point reduction in royalty rate or a 50 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an impairment of approximately 51 million 80 million or 22 million respectively 

if actual results are not consistent with managements’ estimate and assumptions indefinitelife intangible assets may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the company’s financial statements 

based on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately 12 million  in 2014

other matters 

embraco antitrust matters 

beginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the united states embraco has also resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending additional lawsuits could be filed   

at december 31 2015  10 million  remains accrued with installment payments of 8 million  plus interest due at various times through 2016 we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period

befiex credits and other brazil tax matters 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales as the credits were monetized we did not monetize  any befiex credits during the year ended december 31 2015 we monetized 14 million  and 109 million of befiex credits during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we recognized export credits as they were monetized 

in december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2015 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period has been subject to review by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits we are awaiting the resolution of additional proceedings on the retroactive effect of the reinstituted index   

our brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015    the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately   15 billion   brazilian reais approximately   395 million   as of december 31   2015  

relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million  adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production “ipi tax credits” the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million  in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 219 million  brazilian reais approximately 56 million  as of december 31 2015  reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these matters 

in 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled on one of our cases finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of   december 31 2015  our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately   161 million  brazilian reais approximately 41 million  as of december 31 2015  we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015  

in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million  brazilian reais to be paid in 30 monthly installments which began in december 2013 there was a nominal amount of outstanding principal interest and penalties at december 31 2015  the payments for which we will complete during 2016 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings   sessions of trial of the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals or carf have resumed after having been suspended for several months while changes in carf procedures and staffing were implemented the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period 

other litigation 

we have vigorously defended against numerous lawsuits pending in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines we have reached preliminary agreement on a settlement that will resolve all such class action lawsuits the settlement has been accounted for in interest and sundry income expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 the settlement requires court approval in order to be finalized and we are proceeding through the court process to request such approval   

in addition we are currently vigorously defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations and may become involved in similar actions in other jurisdictions these lawsuits allege claims which include negligence breach of contract breach of warranty product liability and safety claims fraud and violation of federal and state regulations including consumer protection acts we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our financial position liquidity or results of operations   

other matters 

in 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in france the investigation includes 11 manufacturers including the whirlpool and indesit operations in france although it is currently not possible to assess the impact if any this matter may have on our consolidated financial statements the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period 

antidumping petition 

on december 16 2015 we submitted a petition requesting that the us department of commerce and the united states international trade commission initiate antidumping investigations regarding large residential washers from china sold by samsung and lg into the united states the purpose of this petition similar to the petitions we filed in december 2011 regarding large residential washers from south korea and mexico is to establish conditions of fair competition in the united states that will support significant investment and innovation in the production of large residential washers in the united states and the us jobs created by that production this petition is the result of our continual monitoring of the large residential washer landscape which highlighted that samsung and lg have continued to dump washers into the united states following the conclusion of our earlier case in 2013 the whirlpool washers affected by the imports subject in this case are made in clyde ohio 

there are several steps in the process of the antidumping investigation we expect a preliminary determination of the amount of dumping in july 2016 the preliminary determination will be followed by several other steps leading to a final decision from the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission which we expect in january 2017

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operation and compliance and reporting risk the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 65 million or loss of approximately 80 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2015  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 35 million respectively related to these contracts

in asia we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances into five operating groups 1 mainland china 2 hong kong and taiwan 3 india which includes bangladesh sri lanka nepal and pakistan 4 oceania which includes australia new zealand and pacific islands and 5 southeast asia which includes thailand singapore malaysia indonesia vietnam the philippines korea myanmar and japan we market and distribute our products in asia primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  amana  bauknecht  jennair  and diqua  brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through fullservice distributors to a large network of retail stores with the acquisition of hefei rongshida sanyo electric co ltd or hefei sanyo which we have since renamed whirlpool china co ltd our operations in china now have expanded distribution to over 30000 distribution points and significant capacity in a complementary low cost manufacturing base 

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux general electric panasonic haier kenmore lg mabe and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our regional footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to latin america are  consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint  brand in emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint  brand sold in the americas  hotpointariston and  ignis  the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool royalstar and diqua  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 563 million  582 million  and 553 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2014  and are not expected to be material in 2015  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier lg panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and participate in joint ventures we acquired indesit  and a majority interest in hefei sanyo  in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us if our compliance policies including the requirement to comply with all laws are not followed such noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hefei sanyo  and indesit  acquisitions 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2014  we derived approximately 47 of our net sales from outside of north america including 23 in latin america 20 in emea and 4 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

• political legal and economic instability and uncertainty 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• changes in foreign country tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax laws 

• inflation 

• changes in foreign country regulatory requirements 

• various importexport restrictions and the availability of required importexport licenses 

• imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers 

• managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and antitrust laws 

• work stoppages and labor relations 

• disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products 

• government price controls 

• extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable and 

• limitations on the repatriation of earnings and cash 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

unfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities relating to befiex cfc tax and to ipi tax credits see note 7  and note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse affect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters no insurance is likely available regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions for example we have been subject to governmental investigations related to pricing practices of our global compressor business see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and enable us to receive an acceptable return on our investments our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance therefore any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face inventory and other asset risk we writedown product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher deficit spending and debt levels and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states latin america europe and the other areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain economic conditions within our regions and slow recovery in europe and asia along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates the demand for our products depends largely on consumer spending and the availability of financing economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 100000  employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees and may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2014  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately  16 billion   11 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and  05 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses

consolidated net sales 

the following tables summarize units sold and consolidated net sales by operating segment 





managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

consolidated net sales increase d 59  compared to 2013  primarily due to favorable product pricemix higher unit shipments and the benefit of the acquisitions partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower befiex credits excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits consolidated net sales increased 84  compared to 2013  consolidated net sales for 2013   increase d 34  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher unit shipments and befiex credits partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and changes in product pricemix excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits consolidated net sales for 2013   increased 44  compared to 2012  

we provide the percentage change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits as a supplement to the change in net sales as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to provide stockholders with a clearer basis to assess whirlpools results over time this measure is considered a nongaap financial measure and is calculated by translating the current period net sales excluding befiex credits in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales excluding befiex credits 

significant regional trends were as follows 

 we recognized approximately 14 million  109 million  and 37 million  of befiex credits in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively as of december 31 2014  approximately 48 million  of future cash monetization remained for court awarded fees which is not expected to be payable for several years for additional information regarding befiex credits see notes 7  and 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 gross margin 

the table below summarizes gross margin percentages by region 



the consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 50  basis points to 171  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher material costs expenses related to the acquisitions foreign currency and lower befiex credits partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

significant regional trends were as follows 

 selling general and administrative 

the following table summarizes selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by region 



consolidated selling general and administrative expenses in 2014  reflect acquisitionrelated costs and investment expenses compared to 2013  and have increased as a percent of consolidated net sales due to those expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2013  remained flat compared to 2012  primarily due to leverage on increased sales 

restructuring 

during the fourth quarter 2011 the company committed to restructuring plans the 2011 plan to expand our operating margins and improve our earnings through substantial cost and capacity reductions primarily within our north america and emea operating segments all actions related to the 2011 plan have been announced and are now substantially complete over 40 million in costs related to actions authorized under the 2011 plan were recognized during 2014 

during 2014 the company announced the following restructuring plans a the closure of a microwave oven manufacturing facility and other organizational efficiency actions in emea and latin america and b organizational integration activities in china in anticipation of the hefei sanyo transaction these plans resulted in charges of approximately 90 million in 2014 with completion expected by the end of 2015 related to employee termination costs noncash asset impairment costs and facility exit costs 

we incurred restructuring charges of 136 million  196 million  and 237 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

for the full year 2015 we may incur up to 300 million  of restructuring charges which will result in substantial cost reductions additional information about restructuring activities can be found in note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest and sundry income expense 

interest and sundry income expense decrease d 13 million  compared to 2013  primarily driven by lower charges related to embraco antitrust matters and a brazilian government settlement occurring in 2013  during 2013  interest and sundry income expense increase d 43 million  compared to 2012  primarily driven by charges related to embraco antitrust matters a brazilian government settlement and acquisitionrelated investment expenses 

for additional information about the embraco antitrust matters the brazilian collection dispute and the brazilian government settlement see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  see note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense decrease d 12 million  compared to 2013  primarily due to lower interest rates which were offset by higher average debt levels the increase in average debt is related to the funding and assumed debt related to our two acquisitions in 2014 see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements during 2013  interest expense decrease d 22 million  compared to 2012  primarily due to lower interest rates 

income taxes 

income tax expense was 189 million  68 million  and 133 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in tax expense in 2014  compared to 2013  is primarily due to the absence of the united states energy tax credits that were recognized in 2013 

the decrease in tax expense in 2013  compared to 2012  is primarily due to united states energy tax credits recognized partially offset by higher pretax earnings the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed in january 2013 reinstated the energy tax credit for 2012  and 2013  and resulted in a tax credit benefit related to the production of qualifying appliances in 2012  and 2013  in the combined amount of 126 million  all of which was recognized in 2013  for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes the difference between income tax expense at the united states statutory rate of 35  and the income tax expense at effective worldwide tax rates for the respective periods

forwardlooking perspective 

we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2015  to be within the following ranges 

for the fullyear 2015  we expect to generate free cash flow between 700 million  and 800 million  including restructuring cash outlays of up to 250 million  capital spending of 800 million  to 850 million  and us pension contributions of approximately 80 million  

the table below reconciles projected 2015  cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo and which are used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance hefei sanyo’s research and development and working capital 



the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions 

on october 14 2014 we completed our acquisition from fineldo spa and certain members of the merloni family the family a number of shares that when combined with a prior purchase totaled 668  of the voting stock of indesit  for an aggregate purchase price including the prior purchase of €758 million  approximately 965 million  at the dates of purchase without adjustment the company funded the aggregate purchase price for the shares constituting a majority interest that we purchased in october 2014 through the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of 650 million in senior notes on november 4 2014 whirlpool launched a mandatory tender offer for all remaining outstanding shares of indesit  in accordance with italian law which was completed on november 28 2014  at a cost of € 344 million  approximately 429 million  at the date of purchase

on december 3 2014  we acquired the remaining shares for € 32 million  approximately 40 million  at the date of the purchase to obtain 100 ownership additional information about the transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition we assumed  99 million  of bank guarantees through our acquisition of indesit  as of december 31 2014  

on october 24 2014 whirlpool’s whollyowned chinese subsidiary completed its acquisition of a 51  equity stake in hefei sanyo  through two transactions for an aggregate purchase price of rmb 34 billion  approximately  551 million  at the dates of purchase the company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand the cash paid for the private placement portion of the transaction is considered restricted cash which will be used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance hefei sanyo’s research and development and working capital  additional information about the transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities funding pension plans and returns to shareholders we also have  234 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months 

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly in addition we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

we continue to review customer conditions across the eurozone as of december 31 2014  we had €78 million  approximately 94 million  as of december 31 2014  in outstanding trade receivables and shortterm and longterm notes due to us associated with alno ag a longstanding european customer approximately €39 million  approximately 47 million  as of december 31 2014  of the outstanding receivables were overdue as of december 31 2014  in the fourth quarter of 2014 whirlpool and alno entered into an agreement to revise the previous standstill agreement to amend the payment terms of the overdue trade receivables the new agreement cured the violation of the prior agreement and alno’s full overdue balance remains due in full by the end of the first quarter of 2016 our exposure includes not only the outstanding receivables but also the potential risks of an alno bankruptcy and impacts to our distribution process alno is proceeding to secure additional financing to improve its financial position 

in march 2014 whirlpool sold approximately 74 million shares held in alno ag for approximately 5 million  this transaction resulted in the conversion of our investment from the equity method of accounting to an available for sale investment due to our less than 20 overall investment in alno ag 

as of december 31 2014  we had 10 billion  of cash and equivalents on hand of which 09 billion  was held outside of the united states our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated we would then be required to accrue and pay applicable us taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries 

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2014  through cash flows from operations cash and equivalents and financing arrangements our cash and equivalents at december 31 2014  decreased 354 million  compared to the same period in 2013  significant drivers of changes in our cash and equivalents balance during 2014  are discussed below 

cash flow summary 



managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

cash flows from operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2014  reflects strong cash earnings and working capital improvements partially offset by 125 million to fund our united states qualified pension plans 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly within a quarter primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements as well as receivable and payment terms dependent on timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements throughout the year due to the variables discussed above cash flow from operations during the year may significantly exceed our quarter and yearend balances 

we offer our suppliers access to third party payables processors independent of whirlpool the processors allow suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the discretion of only the supplier and the financial institution we have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services all of our obligations including amounts due remain to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements as of december 31 2014  and 2013  approximately 16 billion and 13 billion respectively are outstanding under the programs with participating financial institutions 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities of 25 billion  during 2014   increase d 19 billion  from 2013  primarily driven by the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  and higher capital investment to support new product innovations cash used in investing activities of 582 million  during 2013   increase d 88 million  from 2012  primarily driven by higher capital investment to support new product innovations 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities during 2014  increased compared to 2013  primarily due to the funding required to complete the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  partially offset by lower share repurchase activity cash used in financing activities during 2013  increased compared to 2012  primarily due to the resumption of our share repurchase program and higher cash dividends partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises 

financing arrangements

further discussion of this transaction can be found in note 2  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have guarantee arrangements in a brazilian subsidiary as a standard business practice in brazil the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies if a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the guaranteed amounts totaled 492 million  and 485 million  respectively our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters in addition we assumed  12 billion  of corporate guarantees through our acquisition of indesit  as of december 31 2014  we had no losses associated with these guarantees in 2014  or 2013  

we have guaranteed a 45 million  five year revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a notforprofit entity in connection with a community and economic development project “harbor shores” the credit facility which originated in 2008 was amended in 2014 by harbor shores and reduced to 45 million  was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 the fair value of the guarantee was nominal the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had approximately 401 million  and 404 million  outstanding under these agreements respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

  pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2014  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2015  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined at december 31 2014  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2014  retirement obligations and 2015  retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years’ financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had total deferred tax assets of 32 billion  and 30 billion  respectively net of valuation allowances of 308 million  and 186 million  respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million in 2011 to the current year tax expense of  189 million  and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including remaining befiex credits business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1  7  and 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

befiex credits 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales as of december 31 2014  all befiex credits that were available to be monetized had been monetized for additional information regarding befiex credits see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 7  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  goodwill and intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2014  we had goodwill of 28 billion  goodwill increased by 11 billion in 2014  due to the acquisitions of hefei sanyo  and indesit  there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for goodwill resulting from the acquisitions we have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a carrying value of approximately 15 billion  629 million and 42 million respectively as of december 31 2014  

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

goodwill valuations 

we evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment test  in 2014 this assessment was performed for the nar and lar operating segments as impairment indicators do not exist for goodwill acquired in 2014 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative tests performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit actual and projected operating results relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

if the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill   

evaluating goodwill  results and significant assumptions 

based on the favorable results of the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2014  there was no goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2014  

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

for our north america reporting unit our qualitative assessment included a review of the events and factors outlined above our last quantitative test was performed in 2011 significant weight was provided to the following factors as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

 the implied increases to the fair value of our north america reporting unit noted above are further supported by an increase in our overall market capitalization of approximately 11 billion or approximately 280 as of october 1 2014  compared to the prior quantitative assessment in 2011 this increase is largely attributable to the improved operating performance of the north america reporting unit 

intangible valuations 

we evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative test 

when the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 

  evaluating trademarks  results and significant assumptions 

we performed a qualitative assessment for one trademark with a value of approximately 18 million our prior quantitative test performed in 2011 indicated that the fair value for this trademark exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 400 based on the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2014  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of this trademark was greater than its respective carrying value therefore no impairment was recorded 

based on the results of our impairment test performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately 12 million  the fair values of all other trademarks tested exceed their carrying values by more than 10 with the exception of one north american trademark the fair value of this trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately 1 billion by 5 the fair value of this trademark was lower in 2014 as a result of extended transitions to deliver product innovation in north america we invested significantly in this trademark in 2014 and are on track to deliver these new products in 2015 

in performing the quantitative test significant assumptions used in our relief from royalty model as of october 1 2014  included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

 many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairments

issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605 revenue recognition this asu is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract this pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and is to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods with early application not permitted we have not yet determined the potential effects on the consolidated condensed financial statements if any 

all other issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

other matters 

embraco antitrust matters 

beginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions 

embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the united states embraco also has resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending additional lawsuits could be filed 

at december 31 2014  25 million  remains accrued with installment payments of 21 million  plus interest remaining to be made to government authorities at various times through 2015 we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period 

befiex credits and other tax matters 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales as the credits are monetized we monetized   14 million    109 million   and   37 million   of export credits in   2014    2013   and   2012  respectively we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we recognized export credits as they were monetized 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

in december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2014 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period is currently being reviewed by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits the outcome and timing of the brazilian court decisions remains uncertain   

our brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2014    the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately   14 billion   brazilian reais approximately   533 million   as of december 31   2014  

relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million  adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production “ipi tax credits” the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million  in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 204 million  brazilian reais approximately 78 million  as of december 31 2014  reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these matters 

in 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled in our case finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of   december 31 2014  our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately   178 million  brazilian reais approximately 67 million  as of december 31 2014  we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2014  

in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million  brazilian reais approximately 28 million  as of december 31 2014  paid in 30 monthly installments from december 2013 

in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other befiex matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions   

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period

other litigation 

we are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment product liability claims and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of many of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements   

in addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product liability claims fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our consolidated financial statements   

other matters 

in 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in france the investigation includes 11 manufacturers including the whirlpool and indesit operations in france although it is currently not possible to assess the impact if any this matter may have on our consolidated financial statements the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operation and compliance and reporting risk the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014  a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain or loss of approximately 6580 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2014  a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 40 million respectively related to these contracts

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier indesit kenmore lg mabe and samsung many of whom are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to latin america are  consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  kitchenaid bauknecht  and ignis  the most important trademark to asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 582 million  553 million  and 578 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2013 and are not expected to be material in 2014 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phasedin over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier lg panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments   from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and participate in joint ventures these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and in managing strategic investments furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 

our growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these markets may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us if our compliance policies including the requirement to comply with all laws are not followed  such noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example our anticipated acquisition of a 51 percent equity stake in hefei rongshida sanyo electric co ltd hefei sanyo would expand our international operations and thus increase our exposure to certain risks associated with operating internationally see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hefei sanyo acquisition 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher deficit spending and debt levels and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states latin america europe and the other markets in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance therefore any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face inventory and other asset risk we writedown product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

          risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs  for the year ended december 31 2013  we derived approximately 46  of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 26  in latin america 16  in emea and 4  in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

  

 

as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain economic conditions within our regions and slow recovery in the united states europe and asia along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates the markets for our products depend largely on consumer spending and the availability of financing economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital markets 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and enable us to receive an acceptable return on our investments our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances these inflationary costs are expected to have a material impact in 2014 largely driven by increases in the cost of plastic resins and steel as well as component parts impacted by these commodity fluctuations continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

unfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities relating to befiex cfc tax and to ipi tax credits see note 6 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could materially adversely affect our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters no insurance is likely available regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant diversion of management attention and expense we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions have investigated alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our embraco compressor business headquartered in brazil in addition we have been named as a defendant in related lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products these disclosure and reporting requirements became effective for calendar year 2013 affected companies must make disclosures for the first time by may 31 2014 and annually thereafter there have been and will continue to be significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities our disclosure will be predicated upon the timely receipt of accurate information from suppliers who may be unwilling or unable to provide us with the relevant information as a result these new requirements could adversely affect our costs the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results  we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2013  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 15 billion   09 billion  of which was attributable to pension plans and 06 billion  of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business  as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 69000  employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees and may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

2013  overview 

whirlpool delivered very strong operating results in 2013 as we continued to execute our business priorities which include continued investments in new product innovations a focus on cost productivity programs and the execution of cost and capacity reduction initiatives these priorities which have been consistent for several years placed us in a strong position to benefit from the improving consumer confidence and industry demand levels experienced in the united states during 2013 a continuation of the recessionary demand environment throughout the eurozone a slowdown in emerging markets and volatility in foreign currencies partially offset the positive results in the united states during 2013 

we believe that continued execution of our business priorities and a focus on longterm growth will allow the company to adapt to changes in the macroeconomic environment and maintain our position as the worlds leading global manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations 



                   nm not meaningful 

consolidated net sales 

the following tables summarize units sold and consolidated net sales by operating segment 





consolidated net sales increased 34  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher unit shipments and befiex credits partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and changes in product mix excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits consolidated net sales increased 44 compared to 2012  consolidated net sales for 2012  decreased 28 compared to 2011  primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency lower befiex credits recognized and lower unit shipments which were largely offset by favorable pricing and mix excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits consolidated net sales for 2012  increased 29 compared to 2011  

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

we provide the percentage change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency and befiex credits as a supplement to the change in net sales as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to provide stockholders with a clearer basis to assess whirlpools results over time this measure is considered a nongaap financial measure and is calculated by translating the current period net sales excluding befiex credits in functional currency to us dollars using the prioryear periods exchange rate compared to the prioryear period net sales excluding befiex credits 

significant regional trends were as follows 

  

 

 

we were able to recognize approximately 109 million  37 million  and 266 million  of befiex credits in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively as of december 31 2013 approximately 66 million of future cash monetization remained including 52 million of related court awarded fees which is not expected to be payable for several years for additional information regarding befiex credits see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

 

 gross margin 

the table below summarizes gross margin percentages by region 



the consolidated gross margin percentage increased 17  points to 176  compared to 2012  primarily due to productivity restructuring initiatives higher befiex credits and favorable pricemix partially offset by higher material costs 

  

significant regional trends were as follows 

  

 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

 selling general and administrative 

the following table summarizes selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by region 



consolidated selling general and administrative expenses in 2013 reflect an increased investment in consumer advertising compared to 2012 and remain flat as a percent of consolidated net sales due to leverage on increased sales selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2012  increased compared to 2011  primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation 

restructuring 

during the fourth quarter 2011 the company committed to restructuring plans the 2011 plan to expand our operating margins and improve our earnings through substantial cost and capacity reductions primarily within our north america and emea operating segments all actions related to the 2011 plan have been announced and are now substantially complete with cumulative costs of 511 million incurred through december 31 2013 approximately 50 million in costs related to actions authorized under the 2011 plan remain and will be recognized primarily during 2014 

in january 2014 the company announced the closure of a microwave oven manufacturing facility in emea by the end of 2014 this action combined with other organizational efficiency actions in emea are expected to result in charges of approximately 50 million  in 2014 primarily related to employee termination costs noncash asset impairment costs and facility exit costs 

we incurred restructuring charges of 196 million  237 million  and 136 million  for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively future cash expenditures relating to the 2011 plan and the other actions discussed above are approximately 177 million of which we expect the majority to be paid in 2014 additional information about restructuring activities can be found in note 10  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

interest and sundry income expense 

 interest and sundry income expense increased 43 million compared to 2012  primarily driven by charges related to embraco antitrust matters a brazilian government settlement and investment expenses related to the pending acquisition of hefei rongshida sanyo electric co ltd hefei sanyo during 2012 interest and sundry income expense decreased 495 million compared to 2011 primarily driven by charges related to the 2011 settlement of the brazilian collection dispute and lower charges related to embraco antitrust matters partially offset by 2012 expenses related to the conclusion of longstanding united states contract and patent resolutions 

for additional information about the embraco antitrust matters the brazilian collection dispute and the brazilian government settlement see note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the pending acquisition of hefei sanyo see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 22 million compared to 2012  primarily due to lower interest rates during 2012 interest expense decreased 14 million compared to 2011 primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average monthly debt levels 

income taxes 

the income tax expense benefit was 68 million  133 million and 436 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the decrease in tax expense in 2013  compared to 2012  is primarily due to united states energy tax credits recognized partially offset by higher pretax earnings the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed in january 2013 reinstated the energy tax credit for 2012 and 2013 and resulted in a tax credit benefit related to the production of qualifying appliances in 2012 and 2013 in the combined amount of 126 million  all of which was recognized in 2013 

the increase in tax expense in 2012 compared to 2011  is primarily due to higher pretax earnings and the expiration of the united states energy tax credit in 2012 for additional information about our consolidated tax provision see note 11  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes the difference between income tax expense at the united states statutory rate of 35  and the income tax expense benefit at effective worldwide tax rates for the respective periods

forwardlooking perspective 

we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2014  to be within the following ranges 



for the fullyear 2014 we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 700 million including restructuring cash outlays of up to 150 million capital spending of 625 million to 675 million and us pension contributions of approximately  160 million  

the table below reconciles projected 2014  cash provided by operations determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses 



the projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the board of directors of whirlpool and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies 

financial condition and liquidity 

our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business we regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions in the last 12 months whirlpools credit rating was upgraded by sp to bbb and by moodys to baa2 returning to prerecession levels 

recent improvements in consumer confidence and housing within the united states have begun a trend away from the recessionary demand environment experienced in recent years these improvements have offset the financial impact from higher global material costs and economic weakness throughout the eurozone while we continue to expect that we will operate under uncertain and volatile global economic conditions we believe that the improving trends in the united states and our recently executed and announced cost and capacity reductions will allow us to generate operating cash flow together with access to sufficient sources of liquidity that will be adequate to meet our ongoing requirements to fund our operations

results of operations  continued 

as disclosed on our current report on form 8k which we filed with the sec on august 13 2013 on august 12 2013 whirlpool’s whollyowned chinese subsidiary entered into agreements to acquire a 51  equity stake in hefei rongshida sanyo electric co ltd “hefei sanyo” through two transactions for an aggregate purchase price of rmb 34 billion approximately 555 million as of december 31 2013 the company currently intends to fund the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand or other public or private debt financing depending on the timing of the closing and market conditions the acquisition which has been approved by hefei sanyo’s board of directors is subject to certain closing conditions approvals from the ministry of commerce of the people’s republic of china antitrust and foreign strategic investment the stateowned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council and hefei sanyo shareholders share purchase and private placement transactions have been received the china securities regulatory commission approval including waiver of a tender offer as well as regulatory reviews and approvals by other governmental authorities have not yet been received the acquisition is also subject to a 20 million breakup fee whirlpool currently expects to close the transactions anytime between the end of the second quarter and the end of 2014 additionally the transaction includes the commitment of capital and technical resources to enhance hefei sanyo’s research and development and product innovation additional information about the transaction can be found in note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending restructuring activities our united states pension plans and returns to shareholders we also have  607 million  of term debt maturing in the next twelve months 

we monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly in addition we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty 

we continue to monitor the general financial instability and uncertainty throughout europe at december 31 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and thirdparty receivables of approximately 385 million in belgium which was the only country in europe with exposure for cash cash equivalents and third party receivables greater than 1 of our consolidated assets in addition as of december 31 2013 we had 76 million  in outstanding trade and other receivables associated with alno ag a longstanding european customer alno took steps to strengthen its financial position during 2013 including the successful issuance in €45 million public bonds during the second quarter additionally in april 2013 we agreed to convert €30 million equivalent to 41 million as of december 31 2013 of past due receivables into a note receivable at a fair market interest rate with €10 million due in 2014 and €20 million due in 2017 this transaction did not have a material impact on our results of operations based on our assessment of the fair value of the receivables 

as of december 31 2013  we had 14 billion  of cash and equivalents on hand of which 13 billion  was held outside of the united states our cash balance in the united states at december 31 2013  decreased from the prior year primarily due to higher return to shareholders through higher dividends paid and the resumption of our share repurchase program during 2013 our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable us taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries 

sources and uses of cash 

we met our cash needs during 2013  through cash flows from operations cash and equivalents and financing arrangements our cash and equivalents at december 31 2013  increased 212 million  compared to the same period in 2012  significant drivers of changes in our cash and equivalents balance during 2013  are discussed below

the increase in cash provided by operations during 2013 reflects higher cash earnings and working capital improvements which were partially offset by 116 million to fund our united states qualified pension plans the increase in cash provided by operations during 2012 reflects strong cash earnings and working capital improvements which were partially offset by approximately 400 million for legal settlements and 167 million to fund our united states qualified pension plans 

the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly within a quarter primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements as well as receivable and payment terms dependent on timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements throughout the year due to the variables discussed above cash flow used in operations during the year may significantly exceed our quarter and yearend balances 

we offer our suppliers access to third party payables processors independent of whirlpool the processors allow suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the discretion of only the supplier and the financial institution we have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services all of our obligations including amounts due remain to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements as of december 31 2013  and 2012  approximately 13 billion and 12 billion respectively have been sold by suppliers to participating financial institutions 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash used in investing activities of 582 million  during 2013  increased 88 million from 2012  primarily driven by higher capital investment to support new product innovations cash used in investing activities of 494 million during 2012 decreased 102 million from 2011 primarily driven by lower capital investment due to project timing and the completion of a significant investment in a new cooking facility in the united states during 2011 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2013  increased compared to 2012  primarily due to the resumption of our share repurchase program and higher cash dividends partially offset by increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with stock option exercises cash used in financing activities during 2012 decreased compared to 2011 reflecting increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with stock options partially offset by a net reduction in longterm debt levels and higher cash dividends 

financing arrangements 

we have a 1725 billion committed credit facility maturing on june 28 2016 which includes a 200 million letter of credit subfacility borrowings under the credit facility are available to us and designated subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including commercial paper support subsidiary borrowings under this facility if any are guaranteed by whirlpool corporation interest under the credit facility accrues at a variable annual rate based on libor plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin the margin is dependent on our credit rating at that time the credit facility requires us to meet certain leverage and interest coverage requirements we will incur a commitment fee based on whirlpools credit rating for any unused portion of the credit facility at december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement and are in compliance with all financial covenant requirements 

we have committed credit facilities in brazil which provide borrowings up to 1120 million  brazilian reais approximately 478 million  as of december 31 2013  maturing in 2014 and in 2015 the credit facilities contain no financial covenants and we had no  borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at december 31 2013  and 2012  

in march 2013 500 million  of 550  notes matured and were repaid on february 27 2013 we completed a debt offering of 250 million  principal amount of 370  notes due in 2023 and 250 million  principal amount of 515  notes due in 2043 collectively the notes the notes contain covenants that limit our ability to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions in addition if we experience a specific kind of change of control we are required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price of 101  of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest the notes are registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended pursuant to the company’s registration statement on form s3 file no 333181339 filed with the sec on may 11 2012

401k defined contribution plan 

during january 2012 we began contributing company stock to fund the company match and automatic company contributions equal to up to 7 of employees eligible pay in our 401k defined contribution plan covering all us employees we contributed 49 million of company stock to our 401k defined contribution plan during 2012 we resumed funding the company match and automatic contribution in cash during the fourth quarter 2012 

contractual obligations and forwardlooking cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 

  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have guarantee arrangements in a brazilian subsidiary as a standard business practice in brazil the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies if a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary as of december 31 2013  and 2012  the guaranteed amounts totaled 485 million  and 449 million  respectively our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters we had no losses associated with these guarantees in 2013 or 2012 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

we have guaranteed a 50 million  five year revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a notforprofit entity in connection with a community and economic development project “harbor shores” the credit facility which originated in 2008 was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 the fair value of the guarantee was nominal the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had approximately 404 million  and  600  million outstanding under these agreements respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense 

our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2013  and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2014  were prepared using the assumptions that were determined at december 31 2013  the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our december 31 2013  retirement obligations and 2014 retirement benefit costs of our united states plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results 

  





these sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years’ financial results furthermore the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations see note 12  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had total deferred tax assets of 30 billion  and 31 billion  respectively net of valuation allowances of 186 million  and 130 million  respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million in 2011 to the current year tax expense of  68 million  and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including remaining befiex credits business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 6 and 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

befiex credits 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduce brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales we recognize befiex credits as they are monetized however future actions by the brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits for additional information regarding befiex credits see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

warranty obligations 

the estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

goodwill and intangibles 

certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2013  we have goodwill of 1724 million  which is primarily recorded within our north america reporting unit there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units we have trademark assets in our north america and emea operating segments with a carrying value of 1470 million and 53 million respectively as of december 31 2013  

we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 

goodwill valuations 

we evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment test   

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative tests performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit actual and projected operating results relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 

if the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill   

evaluating goodwill  results and significant assumptions 

based on the favorable results of the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2013 there was no goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2013 

for our north america reporting unit where the majority of our goodwill is held our qualitative assessment included a review of the events and factors outlined above our last quantitative test was performed in 2011 significant weight was provided to the following factors as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit 

 the implied increases to the fair value of our north america reporting unit noted above are further supported by an increase in our overall market capitalization of approximately 77 billion or 200 as of october 1 2013 compared to the prior quantitative assessment in 2011 this increase is largely attributable to the improved operating performance of the north america reporting unit 

intangible valuations 

we evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative test   

when the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 

  

evaluating trademarks  results and significant assumptions 

we performed a qualitative assessment for one trademark with a value of approximately 20 million our prior quantitative test performed in 2011 indicated that the fair value for this trademark exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 400 based on the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2013 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of this trademark was greater than its respective carrying value therefore no impairment was recorded 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

we performed a quantitative test for our remaining trademarks based on the results of our test as of october 1 2013 we determined that no impairment existed for our trademarks 

in performing the quantitative test significant assumptions used in our relief from royalty model as of october 1 2013 included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below 

  

 many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairments

issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

other matters 

embraco antitrust matters 

beginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions in 2013 embraco sales represented approximately 8  of our global net sales 

government authorities in brazil europe the united states and other jurisdictions have entered into agreements with embraco and concluded their investigations of the company in connection with these agreements embraco has acknowledged violations of antitrust law with respect to the sale of compressors at various times from 2004 through 2007 and agreed to pay fines or settlement payments 

since the government investigations commenced in february 2009 embraco and other compressor manufacturers have been named as defendants in related antitrust lawsuits in various jurisdictions seeking damages in connection with the pricing of compressors during certain periods beginning in 1996 or later we have resolved certain claims and certain claims remain pending 

in february 2013 embraco entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs representing a proposed settlement class of us “direct purchasers” of compressors which provides for among other things the payment by embraco of up to 30 million subject to reduction for optouts in exchange for a release by all settlement class members the settlement agreement which was preliminarily approved by the court on january 9 2014 and remains subject to final court approval does not cover any claims by direct purchasers which opt out of the proposed settlement class or claims by “indirect purchaser” plaintiffs other lawsuits are also pending and additional lawsuits may be filed by purported purchasers of compressors or other plaintiffs 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in connection with the defense and resolution of the embraco antitrust matters we have incurred cumulative charges of approximately 409 million  since 2009 including fines defense costs and other expenses these charges have been recorded within interest and sundry income expense at december 31 2013 117 million  remains accrued with installment payments of 46 million  plus interest remaining to be made to government authorities at various times through 2015 

we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations 

brazilian collection dispute 

we reached an agreement in june 2011 to settle all claims arising from our longstanding dispute in brazil with banco safra sa such settlement was subsequently approved by a brazilian court in july 2011 pursuant to the settlement our subsidiary agreed to pay banco safra sa 959 million  brazilian reais in two installments the first of 469 million  reais equivalent to 301 million  was made in july 2011 and the second of 490 million  reais equivalent to 275 million  was made during january 2012 

befiex credits 

in previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian government’s export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we were able to recognize approximately 109 million  37 million  and 266 million  of export credits in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we recognize export credits as they are monetized however future actions by the brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits 

in december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits it is unknown whether brazilian courts will require that use of the reinstituted index be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period the effect of which would be to increase the amount of befiex credits we would be entitled to recognize 

our brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2013 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 12 billion brazilian reais equivalent to  530 million  as of december 31 2013 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period 

brazil tax matters 

relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production “ipi tax credits” the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 197 million brazilian reais equivalent to 84 million  as of december 31 2013 reflecting the original assessment plus interest and penalties we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these matters 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

in 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled in our case finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2013  our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 108 million  reais equivalent to 46 million  we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2013  

in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in payments including principal and discounted interest and penalties of 123 million reais equivalent to 53 million as of december 31 2013 with 2 million paid in 2013 and the remainder in 30 monthly installments increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate during the fourth quarter 2013 we recognized pretax charges of 11 million in cost of products sold and 17 million in interest and sundry income expense related to this program 

in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including befiex credits which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions however each of these matters may take several years to resolve and the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable for additional information regarding befiex credits see note 11 of the consolidated financial statements 

other litigation 

we are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek unspecified compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product defect fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our consolidated financial statements 

antidumping actions 

in january 2014 the us court of international trade “cit” ruled on our appeal from a 2012 determination by the us international trade commission “itc” that dumped and subsidized bottommount refrigerators imported from south korea into the united states did not cause material injury to domestic producers the cit found errors in the itc’s decision and remanded the case for reconsideration following the cit ruling we decided to no longer pursue appeals related to the bottom mount refrigerator action in january 2014 the cit granted our request to dismiss the appeal and consequently we expect the other pending appeals concerning the bottommount refrigerator case to be dismissed 

in december 2011 we filed petitions requesting that the department of commerce “doc” and the itc initiate antidumping and countervailing duty investigations against large residential washers from south korea and an antidumping investigation against the same products from mexico in december 2012 the doc issued final determinations that several korean and mexican 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations  continued 

producers had engaged in dumping and that certain korean producers received countervailable government subsidies in january 2013 the itc unanimously determined that dumped and subsidized imports caused material injury to domestic producers in february 2013 the doc issued final orders requiring certain south korean and mexican producers to pay cash deposits on imports of large residential washers into the united states various appeals challenging all or part of the doc and itc final determinations have been filed these appeals may take several years to resolve during the pendency of these appeals the doc orders remain in effect and the doc will continue to conduct administrative reviews to determine the amount of dumping and countervailing duties to be paid by these importers the amounts owed will depend on the extent to which foreign producers price these products below fair value and receive subsidies on these products during the periods under review 

conflict minerals 

in august 2012 the sec issued final rules requiring disclosure of the use of conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten and gold originating in the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries we are currently analyzing whether conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products and if so the most efficient and effective means of complying with the due diligence and reporting requirements of the rules the first disclosure reporting period is for the 2013 calendar year with a final report to be filed no later than may 31 2014

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

market risk 

we have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise strategic financial operation and compliance and reporting risk the enterprise risk management process receives board of directors and management oversight drives risk mitigation decisionmaking and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates domestic and foreign interest rates and commodity prices which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition we manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments 

we use foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to chang es in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2013 a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain or loss of approximately 120 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures 

we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices o f which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2013 a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 35 million respectively related to these contracts

as used herein and except where the context otherwise requires “whirlpool” “we” “us” and “our” refer to whirlpool corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

products and markets 

whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major home appliances and related products our principal products are laundry appliances refrigerators and freezers cooking appliances dishwashers mixers and other portable household appliances we also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems 

the following table provides the percentage of net sales for each class of products which accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years 



in north america whirlpool markets and distributes major home appliances and portable appliances under a variety of brand names in the united states we market and distribute products primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  jennair  amana roper estate  admiral  and gladiator  brand names primarily to retailers distributors and builders in canada we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the inglis  admiral  whirlpool  maytag  jennair  amana  roper  estate  and kitchenaid  brand names in mexico we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  acros  kitchenaid  and supermatic  brand names we sell some products to other manufacturers distributors and retailers for resale in north america under those manufacturers’ and retailers’ respective brand names 

in latin america we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the consul brastemp whirlpool  kitchenaid maytag  and eslabón de lujo  brand names we manage appliance sales and distribution in brazil argentina chile and peru through our brazilian subsidiary and in bolivia paraguay and uruguay through our distributors we manage appliance sales and distribution in the caribbean central american countries venezuela colombia guatemala and ecuador through our brazilian subsidiary and through distributors 

in emea we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the whirlpool  bauknecht  ignis  maytag laden  polar  and privileg  brand names and major and portable appliances under the kitchenaid brand name in addition to our operations in western europe we have sales subsidiaries in russia ukraine hungary poland the czech republic slovakia romania bulgaria latvia estonia lithuania croatia morocco and turkey with representative offices in kazakhstan slovenia serbia and montenegro we market and distribute a full line of products under the whirlpool  kic  and ignis  brand names in south africa our european operations also market and distribute products under the whirlpool  bauknecht  and ignis  brand names to distributors and dealers in africa and the middle east

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier kenmore lg  mabe and samsung moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated cost pressure has been experienced during 2012  in some areas such as base metals and plastic resins supply constraints due to environment impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecast production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  bauknecht  and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks are consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademark to asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair  and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 553 million  578 million  and 532 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries that we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2012 and are not expected to be material in 2013 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance  each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as electrolux lg samsung bosch siemens panasonic and general electric are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea alno  major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance  we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demands requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea alno  major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products  a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher deficit spending and debt levels and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states brazil europe and the other markets in which we operate has had an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse affect 

we face inventory and other asset risk  we writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

          risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs  for the year ended december 31 2012  we derived approximately 48  of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 27  in latin america 16  in emea and 5  in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

  

 as a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy   uncertain global economic conditions and slowing or negative growth in the united states europe and china along with continuing difficulties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions including a potential “fiscal cliff” in the united states and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates the markets for our products depend largely on consumer spending and the availability of financing economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 

uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks 

if we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results  the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances these inflationary costs are expected to have a material impact in 2013 largely driven by increases in the cost of plastic resins and base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

unfavorable results of legal  and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance  we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights taxes environmental matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant diversion of management attention and expense for which no insurance is likely available we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance  we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties  we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our embraco compressor business headquartered in brazil in addition we have been named as a defendant in related lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands  we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

           the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance  we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risks in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages intellectual property claims against suppliers hazards such as fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

          significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results  we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2012  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 21 billion   16 billion  of which was attributable to pension plans and 05 billion  of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

         we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results  we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

                our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business  as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 68000  employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 50  our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation  the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in 2013 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in 2014 there will be significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance  we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure

whirlpool corporation the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898 whirlpool manufactures products in 12  countries under 13  principal brand names and markets products in nearly every country around the world whirlpool’s geographic segments consist of north america latin america emea europe middle east and africa and asia as of december 31 2011  whirlpool had approximately 68000  employees 

as used herein and except where the context otherwise requires “whirlpool” “we” “us” and “our” refer to whirlpool corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

products and markets 

whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major home appliances and related products our principal products are laundry appliances refrigerators and freezers cooking appliances dishwashers mixers and other portable household appliances we also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems 

the following table provides the total net sales for each class of products which accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years 



in north america whirlpool markets and distributes major home appliances and portable appliances under a variety of brand names in the united states we market and distribute products primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  jennair  amana roper estate  admiral  and gladiator  brand names primarily to retailers distributors and builders in canada we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the inglis  admiral  whirlpool  maytag  jennair  amana  roper  estate  and kitchenaid  brand names in mexico we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  acros  kitchenaid  and supermatic  brand names we sell some products to other manufacturers distributors and retailers for resale in north america under those manufacturers’ and retailers’ respective brand names 

in latin america we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the consul brastemp whirlpool  kitchenaid maytag  and eslabón de lujo  brand names we manage appliance sales and distribution in brazil argentina chile and peru through our brazilian subsidiary and in bolivia paraguay and uruguay through our distributors we manage appliance sales and distribution in the caribbean central american countries venezuela colombia guatemala and ecuador through our brazilian subsidiary and through distributors 

in emea we market and distribute our major home appliances primarily under the whirlpool  bauknecht  ignis  maytag laden  polar  and privileg  brand names and major and portable appliances under the kitchenaid brand name in addition to our operations in western europe we have sales subsidiaries in russia ukraine hungary poland the czech republic slovakia greece romania bulgaria latvia estonia lithuania croatia morocco and turkey with representative offices in kazakhstan slovenia serbia and montenegro we market and distribute a full line of products under the whirlpool  kic  and ignis  brand names in south africa our european operations also market and distribute products under the whirlpool  bauknecht  and ignis  brand names to distributors and dealers in africa and the middle east 

in asia we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances into five operating groups 1 mainland china 2 hong kong and taiwan 3 india which includes bangladesh sri lanka nepal and pakistan 4 oceania which includes australia new zealand and pacific islands and 5 southeast asia which includes thailand singapore malaysia indonesia vietnam the philippines korea and japan we market and distribute our products in asia primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  amana  and jennair  brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and fullservice distributors to a large network of retail stores 

competition 

competition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as electrolux general electric kenmore lg bosch siemens samsung and haier moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on research and development including introducing new innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated cost pressure has been experienced during 2011  in some areas such as steel resins and oilbased commodities supply constraints due to environment impacts such as hurricanes tsunamis and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecast production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana  and acros  the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool  bauknecht  and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks are consul   brastemp   whirlpool and  kitchenaid  the most important trademark to asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair  and amana  brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 578 million  532 million  and 500 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries that we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2011  and are not expected to be material in 2012  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance  each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as electrolux lg samsung bosch siemens panasonic and general electric are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance  we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demands requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products  a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states brazil europe and the other markets in which we operate has had an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse affect 

we face inventory and other asset risk  we record a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs  for the year ended december 31 2011  we derived approximately 49  of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 27  in latin america 17  in europe and 5  in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

  

 additionally as a us corporation we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

the recent european debt crisis could have a material adverse effect on our european operations   the recent european debt crisis and related european financial restructuring efforts have contributed to instability in the global credit markets and may cause the value of the euro to further deteriorate if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in europe the united states or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further the value of the euro could decline and the credit market may weaken the general financial instability in the stressed european countries could have a contagion effect on the region and contribute to the general instability and uncertainty in the european union if this were to occur it could adversely affect our european customers and suppliers and in turn may have a materially adverse effect on our european business and results of operations 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results  the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances material cost inflation is expected to be approximately 300 million to 350 million in 2012  largely driven by increases in the cost of base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance  we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights taxes environmental matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and sales 

and trading practices results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance  we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties  we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our embraco compressor business headquartered in brazil in addition we have been named as a defendant in related class action lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands  we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance  we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risks in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results  we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa the pension protection act and the internal revenue code govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2011  our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 1990 million 1502 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 488 million of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results  we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business  as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 68000  employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 59  our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry 

we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation  the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance  we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure

 item 1 business  tableend whirlpool corporation the world’s leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898 whirlpool manufactures products in 12 countries under 13 principal brand names and markets products in nearly every country around the world whirlpool’s geographic segments consist of north america latin america europe and asia as of december 31 2010 whirlpool had approximately 71000 employees 

as used herein and except where the context otherwise requires “whirlpool” “we” “us” and “our” refer to whirlpool corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

products and markets 

whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products primarily for home use our principal products are laundry appliances refrigerators cooking appliances dishwashers mixers and other small household appliances we also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems 

the following table provides the total net sales for each class of products which accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years 

 

 in north america whirlpool markets and distributes major home appliances and portable appliances under a variety of brand names in the united states we market and distribute products primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  jennair  amana roper estate  admiral and gladiator brand names primarily to retailers distributors and builders in canada we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the inglis  admiral  whirlpool  maytag  jennair  amana  roper  estate and kitchenaid brand names in mexico we market and distribute major home appliances primarily under the whirlpool  maytag  acros  kitchenaid and supermatic brand names we sell some products to other manufacturers distributors and retailers for resale in north america under those manufacturers’ and retailers’ respective brand names 

whirlpool is a major supplier of a wide range of home appliances to lowe’s lowe’s is a major outlet for our whirlpool maytag kitchenaid roper and gladiator brand products sales activity with lowe’s represented 10 9 and 8 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

competition 

competition in the home appliance industry is intense in addition to our traditional competitors electrolux general electric and kenmore there are expanding foreign competitors such as lg bosch siemens samsung and haier moreover the united states customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive prices products and services in most major markets throughout the world 2010 was a challenging year with continued high costs of metals and oilbased materials competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on research and development including introducing new innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

raw materials and purchased components 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated while we experienced cost pressure during 2010 in metals and oilbased materials in some cases driven by supply constraints that required the qualification and use of alternate materials at premium cost we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated future production schedules 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool  maytag  jennair  kitchenaid  amana estate  roper  admiral and acros  the most important trademarks to europe are whirlpool  bauknecht and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks are consul brastemp and whirlpool  the most important trademark to asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair admiral and amana brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies 

  

research and development 

expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 516 million 489 million and 463 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

protection of the environment 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal state local and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries that we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide were approximately 31 million 29 million and 31 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we estimate that in 2011 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately 34 million capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2011 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters 

maytag acquisition 

on march 31 2006 we completed our acquisition of maytag the aggregate purchase price for maytag was approximately 19 billion including approximately 848 million of cash and approximately 97 million shares of whirlpool common stock maytag had consolidated net sales for 2005 of approximately 49 billion with the acquisition whirlpool added an array of home appliance brands including maytag jennair amana and admiral  we have realized cost savings from all areas across the value chain including product manufacturing and marketing global procurement logistics infrastructure and support areas product research and development and asset utilization in 2007 we completed the sale of all maytag adjacent businesses which were not part of the core appliance business

risks relating to our business 

we face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as electrolux lg samsung bosch siemens and general electric are large wellestablished companies that rank among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover the united states customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive prices products and services competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowe’s sears home depot casas bahia ikea major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowe’s sears home depot casas bahia ikea major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer confidence and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states brazil and the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning product defects intellectual property rights taxes environmental matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserves 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our embraco compressor business headquartered in brazil in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous related class action lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal 

  

contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2010 we derived approximately 47 of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 25 in latin america 17 in europe and 5 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

           additionally as a us corporation we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our failure to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales if we failed in this way it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we face inventory and other asset risk we record a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value although we believe our 

  

inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances material cost inflation is expected to be approximately 250 million to 300 million in 2011 largely driven by increases in base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risks in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our north american employees and certain foreign employees we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa the pension protection act and the internal revenue code govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2010 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 2205 million 1534 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 671 million of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we 

  

attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 71000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 60 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us

whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products primarily for home use our principal products are laundry appliances refrigerators cooking appliances dishwashers mixers and other small household appliances we also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems 

for each class of products which accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years the following table lists the total net sales of each class

competition 

competition in the home appliance industry is intense in addition to traditional competitors such as electrolux general electric and kenmore there are expanding foreign competitors such as lg bosch siemens samsung and haier moreover the us customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices in most major markets throughout the world 2009 was a challenging year with continued high costs in the areas of metals and oilbased materials such as resins in addition in 2008 and 2009 we experienced significant macroeconomic challenges including instability in the financial markets these challenges have impacted the global economy the capital markets and global demand for our products competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including cost selling price distribution performance innovation product features energy efficiency quality and other financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs focusing on research and development including introducing new products through innovation building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

other information 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated there has been continued cost pressure in some areas such as metals and oilbased materials during most of the year in the later part of the year costs in most of these areas started to show signs of relief but remain at elevated levels we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules 

  

the patents we presently own are considered in the aggregate to be valuable also whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the us and foreign countries the most important trademarks that we own in north america are whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  estate  roper  admiral  amana  jennair  and acros  the most important trademarks that we own in europe are whirlpool  bauknecht and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks that we own are whirlpool  brastemp and consul  the most important trademark that we own in asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair admiral amana and magic chef brand names 

expenditures for whirlpoolsponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 455 million in 2009 436 million in 2008 and 421 million in 2007 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal state local and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to approximately 29 million in 2009 31 million in 2008 and 28 million in 2007 we estimate that in 2010 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately 29 million capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2010 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products  a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer confidence and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs and higher tax rates adversely affect demand the decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states and the other markets in which we operate has and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future 

the global financial crisis could adversely affect our business and financial performance the ongoing global financial crisis has tightened credit markets and lowered liquidity levels lower credit availability may increase borrowing costs some of our suppliers are experiencing serious financial problems due to reduced access to credit and lower revenues financial duress may prompt some of our suppliers to seek to renegotiate supply terms with us reduce production or file for bankruptcy protection our customers may be unable to obtain financing to purchase products and meet their payment obligations to us in addition the financial crisis could result in the insolvency of one or more of our customers the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our operations earnings cash flows andor financial position 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include sears lowe’s home depot casas bahia best buy ikea major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial 

  

decline in volume of sales to sears lowe’s home depot casas bahia best buy ikea major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally if these trade customers lose market share this loss could negatively impact our financial performance 

we face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as electrolux lg samsung bosch siemens and general electric are large wellestablished companies that rank among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market competition in the global market is based on a number of factors including performance innovation product features and design energy efficiency quality cost selling price distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations recent extreme volatility in the foreign exchange markets has increased our risk we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

product liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning product defects intellectual property rights taxes environmental matters commercial matters and compliance 

  

with competition laws and sales and trading practices results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our estimates 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our failure to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales if we failed in this way it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

we face inventory and other asset risk we record a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances material cost inflation is expected to be approximately 200 to 300 million in 2010 largely driven by increases in base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risks in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are 

  

subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our north american employees and certain foreign employees we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa the pension protection act and the internal revenue code govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2009 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 2329 million 1568 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 761 million of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface 

  

with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale 

our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets 

risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2009 we derived approximately 45 of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 22 in latin america 19 in europe and 4 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally as a us corporation we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the foreign corrupt practices act could have a material adverse effect on us 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating 

  

alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our compressor business headquartered in brazil these investigations as well as additional investigations by other governmental agencies could result in civil or criminal charges against whirlpool and its employees and the imposition of fines and penalties in addition we have been named as a defendant in numerous related class action lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 67000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 60 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

changes in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us

products and markets 

whirlpool manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products primarily for home use our principal products are laundry appliances refrigerators cooking appliances dishwashers and mixers and other small household appliances we also produce hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems 

for each class of products which accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales over the last three years the following table lists the total net sales of each class 

 

 in north america whirlpool markets and distributes major home appliances and portable appliances under a variety of brand names in the united states we market and distribute products under the whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  jennair  roper  estate  admiral  magic chef  amana  and inglis brand names primarily to retailers distributors and builders in canada we market and distribute major home appliances under the inglis  admiral  whirlpool  maytag  jennair  magic chef  amana  roper  estate and kitchenaid brand names in mexico we market and distribute major home appliances under the whirlpool  maytag  acros  kitchenaid  and supermatic brand names we sell some products to other manufacturers distributors and retailers for resale in north america under those manufacturers’ and retailers’ respective brand names we have manufacturing facilities in the united states and mexico

competition 

competition in the home appliance industry is intense in addition to traditional competitors such as electrolux ge and kenmore there are expanding foreign competitors such as lg bosch siemens samsung fisher  paykel and haier moreover the us customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices in most major markets throughout the world 2008 was a challenging year with continued rising costs in the areas of metals oilbased materials such as resins and transportation in addition in 2008 we experienced significant macroeconomic challenges including instability in the financial markets these challenges have impacted the global economy the capital markets our operating costs and global demand for our products competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including cost selling price distribution performance innovation product features quality and other financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs focusing on research and development including introducing new products through innovation building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

other information 

we are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated there has been continued significant cost pressure in some areas such as metals and oilbased materials during most of the year in the later part of the year costs in most of these areas started to show signs of relief we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules 

the patents we presently own are considered in the aggregate to be valuable also whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the us and foreign countries the most important trademarks that we own in north america are whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  estate  roper  admiral  amana  jennair  and acros  the 

  

most important trademarks that we own in europe are whirlpool  bauknecht and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks that we own are whirlpool  brastemp and consul  the most important trademark that we own in asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair admiral amana and magic chef brand names 

expenditures for whirlpoolsponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 436 million in 2008 421 million in 2007 and 375 million in 2006 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal state local and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to approximately 31 million in 2008 28 million in 2007 and 33 million in 2006 we estimate that in 2009 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately 32 million capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2009 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products  a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer confidence and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs and higher tax rates adversely affect demand the decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states and the other markets in which we operate has and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future 

the global financial crisis could adversely affect our business and financial performance the ongoing global financial crisis has tightened credit markets and lowered liquidity levels lower credit availability may increase borrowing costs some of our suppliers are experiencing serious financial problems due to reduced access to credit and lower revenues financial duress may prompt some of our suppliers to seek to renegotiate supply terms with us reduce production or file for bankruptcy protection our customers may be unable to obtain financing to purchase products and meet their payment obligations to us in addition the financial crisis could result in the insolvency of one or more of our customers the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our operations earnings cash flows andor financial position 

the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include sears lowe’s home depot casas bahia best buy ikea major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected we have been a major supplier of home appliances to sears for many years in 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 11 12 and 14 respectively of our consolidated net sales were attributable to sales to sears of oem and whirlpool brand products the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to sears lowe’s home depot casas bahia best buy ikea major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally if these trade customers lose market share this loss could negatively impact our financial performance 

we face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our business segments operates in a highly 

  

competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as lg samsung bosch siemens and general electric are large wellestablished companies that rank among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market competition in the global market is based on a number of factors including performance innovation product features and design quality cost selling price distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products in order to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations recent extreme volatility in the foreign exchange markets has increased our risk we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

litigation may adversely affect us we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in the event that any of our products proves to be defective we may need to recall or redesign such products there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage against certain product liability claims will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities we incur we also face certain class action litigation regarding allegedly defective products that insurance does not cover a successful claim in excess of or outside of our available insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues including a supplierrelated quality and potential product safety problem that may affect 1 million appliances manufactured between 2001 and 2003 actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our failure to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales if we failed in this way it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

  

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances material cost inflation is expected to be approximately 200 million in 2009 largely driven by increases in base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our north american employees and certain foreign employees we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

as of december 31 2008 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 2425 million 1521 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 904 million of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include the discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expense 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of 

  

sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

if we cannot manage the additional challenges of our international operations our financial performance may suffer for the year ended december 31 2008 we derived approximately 43 of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 21 in europe 19 in latin america and 3 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere 

we are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions on february 17 2009 we received a grand jury subpoena from the us department of justice requesting documents relating to an antitrust investigation of the global compressor industry whirlpool subsidiaries in brazil and italy were visited on the same day by competition authorities seeking similar information this investigation or additional claims or investigations by private plaintiffs or other governmental agencies could adversely affect our business in 2008 sales of compressors represented approximately 6 of our global net sales 

a deterioration in labor relations could negatively impact our global business as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 70000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective 

  

bargaining agreements represent approximately 60 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we cannot be assured that at some point we will not be subject to employee work stoppages and if such events were to occur that there would not be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew the various collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which could also affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may adversely affect whirlpool we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations these types of costs could negatively affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us

competition 

competition in the home appliance industry is intense in addition to traditional competitors such as electrolux ge and kenmore there are expanding foreign competitors such as lg bosch siemens samsung fisher  paykel and haier moreover the us customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices in most major markets throughout the world 2007 was a challenging year with continued rising costs in the areas of metals oilbased materials such as resins and transportation competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including cost selling price distribution performance innovation product features quality and other financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs focusing on research and development including introducing new products through innovation building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

other information 

whirlpool is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to its business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated there has been continued significant cost pressure in some areas such as metals and oilbased materials and significant demand for certain components we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules 

the patents we presently own are considered in the aggregate to be valuable also whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the us and foreign countries the most important trademarks that we own in north america are whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  estate  roper  admiral  amana  jennair  and acros  the most important trademarks that we own in europe are whirlpool  bauknecht and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks that we own are whirlpool  brastemp and consul  the most important trademark that 

  

we own in asia is whirlpool  we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair admiral amana and magic chef brand names 

expenditures for whirlpoolsponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 421 million in 2007 375 million in 2006 and 339 million in 2005 

our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal state local and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to approximately 28 million in 2007 33 million in 2006 and 28 million in 2005 we estimate that in 2008 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately 29 million capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2008 

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

we face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as lg samsung and bosch siemens are large wellestablished companies that rank among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market competition in the global market is based on a number of factors including performance innovation product features quality cost selling price distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products in order to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

the loss of or decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include sears lowe’s home depot and best buy could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of powerful trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers to obtain competitive terms as the trade customers continue to consolidate and become larger our trade customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to respond and meet their requirements our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected we have been a principal supplier of home appliances to sears for many years in 2007 approximately 12 of our consolidated net sales of 19 billion were attributable to sales to sears although no other customers accounted for greater than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2007 other customers may account for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in future periods the loss of or decline in volume of sales to sears lowe’s home depot best buy or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally if these trade customers lose market share this loss could negatively impact our financial performance 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product consumer interest rates consumer confidence retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes and the level of mortgage refinancing generally affect demand for our products a decline in economic activity in the united states and any other markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative and our maytag strategy our global operating 

  

platform initiative aims to reduce costs drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our maytag strategy calls for us to create cost efficiencies through the integration of maytag operations into legacy whirlpool operations and to use our innovation pipeline to reinvigorate maytag brands our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our failure to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales if we failed in this way it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes failure to execute our maytag strategy may result in our inability to realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances prices for materials and oil related costs are expected to increase by approximately 350 million in 2008 largely driven by increases in base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits 

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth  we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operations 

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover most of our north american employees and certain foreign employees we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa governs the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan 

  

as of december 31 2007 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 19 billion 730 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 115 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include the discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future expense 

environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may adversely affect whirlpool we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations these types of costs could negatively affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

litigation may adversely affect us we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in the event that any of our products proves to be defective we may need to recall or redesign such products there can be no guarantee that our insurance coverage against certain product liability claims will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities we incur we also face certain class action litigation regarding allegedly defective products that insurance does not cover a successful claim in excess of or outside of our available insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

a deterioration in labor relations could negatively impact our global business as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 73000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 60 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we cannot be assured that at some point we will not be subject to employee work stoppages and if such events were to occur that there would not be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew the various collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which could also affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not 

  

recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the functional currencies of those operations affect the value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

if we cannot manage the additional challenges of our international operations our financial performance may suffer for the year ended december 31 2007 we derived approximately 40 of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 20 in europe 18 in latin america and 2 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations 

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere

competition 

  

competition in the home appliance industry is intense in addition to traditional competitors such as electrolux ge and kenmore there are new and expanding foreign competitors such as lg bosch siemens samsung fisher  paykel and haier moreover the us customer base is characterized by large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices in most major markets throughout the world 2006 was a challenging year for the industry with continued rising costs in the areas of metals oilbased materials such as resins and transportation competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including cost selling price distribution performance innovation product features quality and other financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs focusing on research and development including introducing new products through innovation building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels and taking other efficiencyenhancing measures 

  

other information 

  

whirlpool is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to its business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier was abruptly terminated there has been continued significant cost pressure in some areas such as metals and oilbased materials and significant demand for certain components we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules 

  

the patents we presently own are considered in the aggregate to be valuable also whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the us and foreign countries the most important trademarks that we own in north america are whirlpool  maytag  kitchenaid  estate  roper  admiral  amana  jennair  magic chef  and acros  the most important trademarks that we own in europe are whirlpool  bauknecht and ignis  in latin america the most important trademarks that we own are whirlpool  brastemp and consul  the most important trademark that we own in asia is whirlpool  whirlpool also receives royalties from licensing its trademarks to 

  

third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair admiral and magic chef brand names 

  

expenditures for whirlpoolsponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 428 million in 2006 339 million in 2005 and 315 million in 2004 

  

whirlpool’s manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility 

  

we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal state local and other governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to approximately 33 million in 2006 28 million in 2005 and 28 million in 2004 we estimate that in 2007 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations will be approximately 27 million capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2007 

  

the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we should be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulations 

  

additionally on february 13 2003 the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee” became law in the european union among other provisions weee stipulates that “producers” be responsible for the cost of collection disposal and recycling of waste for many electrical and electronic products as of august 13 2005 the directive required all european union member states to introduce it into national law by no later than august 2004 in states that have adopted legislation we have complied with all requirements the net impact of compliance with this directive did not have a material effect on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

state and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of “superfund” sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters

risks relating to our business 

  

we face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as lg samsung and bosch siemens are large wellestablished companies that rank among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market competition in the global market is based on a number of factors including performance innovation product features quality cost selling price distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products in order to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affected 

  

the loss of or decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include sears lowe’s home depot and best buy could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of powerful trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are sold through purchase orders and not through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers’ ability to change volume among suppliers to obtain competitive terms as the trade customers continue to consolidate and become larger our trade customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to respond and meet their requirements our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected we have been a principal supplier of home appliances to sears for many years in 2006 approximately 14 of our consolidated net sales of 18 billion were attributable to sales to sears although no other customers accounted for greater than 10 of consolidated net sales in 2006 other customers may account for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in future periods the loss of or decline in volume of sales to sears lowe’s home depot best buy or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally if these trade customers lose market share this loss could negatively impact our financial performance 

  

whirlpool may be unable to successfully integrate the business of maytag in a timely manner which may affect our ability to realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger the recent acquisition of maytag involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently as with every merger there are potential difficulties of combining the companies’ businesses these difficulties may include the integration of maytag’s sales and marketing distribution manufacturing engineering finance and administrative operations both domestic and international with and into our operations our process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of the combined businesses and the loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects after the merger 

  

we expect to generate pretax annualized cost savings of between 350400 million the majority of which is expected to be realized in 2007 with the remainder expected to be realized in 2008 we expect cost efficiencies from all areas of the value chain including product engineering manufacturing and marketing infrastructure and 

  

support areas global procurement and logistics we expect to incur approximately 410 million in pretax onetime costs to realize the annualized savings estimates approximately 150 million of these costs are expected to impact earnings between 2006 through 2008 with the remainder included as part of purchase accounting achieving these benefits will depend upon how and when our business is integrated with maytag and whether we incur any additional costs in connection with the integration if the anticipated benefits are not realized fully or not realized in a timely manner or if there are significant additional costs these occurrences could adversely affect our financial results 

  

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product consumer interest rates consumer confidence retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes and the level of mortgage refinancing generally affect demand for our products a decline in economic activity in the united states and any other markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

  

an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative this initiative aims to reduce costs drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our failure to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales if we failed in this way it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets 

  

fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper and zinc on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances prices for materials are expected to increase by approximately 400 million in 2007 largely driven by increases in base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts and steel continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits 

  

the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers our operations and operations at suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance 

  

significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our north american employees and certain foreign employees we also have unfunded 

  

postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa governs the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans 

  

as of december 31 2006 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 219 billion 850 million of which was attributable to pension plans and 134 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include the discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future expense 

  

environmental and health and safety laws and regulations may adversely affect whirlpool we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations complying with recently passed and enacted regulations in europe such as the weee and rohs restriction of hazardous substances directives may increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to sell certain products in europe these types of costs could negatively affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us 

  

product liability claims may adversely affect us we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage in the event that any of our products proves to be defective we may need to recall or redesign such products there can be no guarantee that our insurance coverage against certain product liability claims will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities we incur we also face certain class action litigation regarding allegedly defective products that insurance does not cover a successful claim in excess of or outside of our available insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

a deterioration in labor relations could negatively impact our global business as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 73000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 60 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we cannot be assured that at some point we will not be subject to employee work stoppages and if such events were to occur that there would not be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew the various collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which could also affect our business financial condition or results of operation 

  

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitiveness 

  

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performance 

  

moreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties we may be unaware of others’ intellectual property rights that may cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

  

future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” or fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position the provisions of fin 48 are effective on january 1 2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle if any recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings based on our evaluation as of december 31 2006 we do not believe that fin 48 will have a material impact on our financial statements changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

  

foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the functional currencies of those operations affect the value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

  

if we cannot manage the additional challenges of our international operations our financial performance may suffer for the year ended december 31 2006 we derived approximately 34 of our net sales from outside of north america including 19 in europe 13 in latin america and 2 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

additionally we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations 

  

terrorist attacks armed conflicts natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere

competition 

  

the major home appliance business is highly competitive in most major markets throughout the world 2002 was a challenging year in the industry with rising material costs decreased consumer demand and intense price competition in north america there has been continued polarization in retail distribution channels with most retailers either 1 offering little or no customer service and competing solely on the basis of price or 2 providing value added services coupled with a brand building strategy the company firmly believes that it can best compete in the current environment by providing value added products and services under its strong brand names 

  

the company believes that in terms of units sold it is the largest north american manufacturer of home laundry appliances and one of the largest north american manufacturers of home refrigerators and freezers room air conditioning equipment dishwashers and cooking products the company believes that in north america there are approximately 20 manufacturers or marketers of major home appliances

the company believes that it is wellpositioned in the latin american appliance market due to its ability to offer a broad range of products under wellrecognized brand names to meet the specific requirements of consumers in the region the company believes that it is about twice the size of its nearest competitor and that there are approximately 25 manufacturers or marketers of major home appliances in the region 

  

  

in asia the major home appliance market is characterized by low saturation and as a result rapid growth except in japan and south korea the asian market is served by approximately 50 manufacturers or marketers of varying size and position on a countrybycountry basis the company believes that it is the industry leader in the indian market and it continues to establish itself throughout the remainder of the region 

  

competition in most of the company’s markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including principally product features price product quality and performance service warranty advertising and promotion as a result of its global position the company believes it has a competitive advantage by reason of its ability to leverage engineering capabilities across regions transfer best practices and economically purchase raw materials and component parts in large volumes
