overview 

republic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2021 we operated facilities in 41 states through 356 collection operations 239 transfer stations 198 active landfills 71 recycling processing centers 3 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 3 treatment storage and disposal facilities tsdf 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells we are engaged in 77 landfill gastoenergy and other renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 124 closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

we believe the total addressable environmental services market in which we operate generates approximately 91 billion of annual revenue which includes the 67 billion us recycling and solid waste industry and 24 billion of the broader environmental services industry within our recycling and solid waste business we prioritize investments in market verticals with above average growth rates and higher return profiles environmental services remains fragmented which provides consolidation opportunities to drive scale we believe we will be able to further expand our addressable market into other segments of the environmental services industry over time by leveraging our differentiated capabilities 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of material is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

our purposedriven vision is to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world we believe that our products and services are valuable to our customers and essential for longterm sustainability we further believe our focus and commitment to sustainability allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase customer loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has impacted the global economy as well as certain aspects of our operations and performance during this time we continued to provide essential services to our customers while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees in april 2020 we launched our committed to serve initiative to help our employees customers and communities across the united states the impact of covid19 on our business and associated costs are discussed in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10k 

foundational elements 

our strategy is designed to generate profitable growth by sustainably managing our customers’ needs and it is underpinned by three foundational elements – 1 our market position 2 our operating model and 3 our people and talent agenda 

market position 

our goal is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 

• volume growth  we believe volumes are driven by population growth household formation and new business formation volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting recyclable and solid waste material under residential collection contracts with municipalities exclusive franchise agreements and smallcontainer and 

largecontainer contracts we also look to enter into longterm disposal and recycling processing contracts with municipalities and other third parties by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at a rate consistent with the underlying economic growth in these markets in addition by securing longterm agreements we are better able to help ensure we earn an appropriate return on the capital deployed 

• price increases  we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in vehicles equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling processing centers 

• expansion of recycling capabilities  based on the most recent us environmental protection agency epa data we believe approximately 32 of municipal solid waste is recycled andor composted we expect that percentage to increase over the longterm as communities enhance and expand their recycling programs for their residents as a key player in the circular economy we are strategically focused on expanding recycling volume through innovative material handling processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an appropriate return we will continue to look for opportunities to expand or enhance our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services and demonstrating a willingness to pay and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

• infrastructure development  we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as a vertically integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated our goal is to create marketspecific vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations landfills and recycling processing centers where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling processing centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites additionally we seek opportunities to expand and permit new airspace at our existing landfills in order to replace airspace consumed development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available through landfill and fleet innovation recycling and circularity of key materials and renewable energy production we’re committed to environmentally responsible operations that increase our efficiency as well as our ability to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world 

external growth 

• acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships  our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privatelyheld companies including increasing competition in the environmental services industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in regulatory requirements and technology and the limited number of exit strategies for privatelyheld companies we also evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publiclyowned companies 

we continue to invest in valueenhancing acquisitions in existing markets given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the recycling and waste operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe over time we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they seek to raise capital andor reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

our operating model allows us to deliver a consistent highquality service to all our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business key elements of our operating model are our organizational structure safety fleet automation compressed natural gas vehicles fleet electrification and standardized maintenance 

organizational structure 

a key enabler of the republic way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

through this operating model we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way 

safety 

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve we have a dedicated team of safety professionals at our corporate headquarters and in our field operations the leader of which reports directly to our chief operating officer due to the nature of our industry we make safety a top priority and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 10 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 38 better than the industry average our think choose live slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think about what you are doing choose the safe answer and live to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition in which they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

through our safety amplified program we are providing even more tools and driving even greater awareness to help our teams better execute our safety standards regular training multifaceted programs and strategic partnerships are key components to this program it is simple by design and comprised of actions and activities that ensure safety is embedded in all we do the program includes six initiatives to help us achieve our goal to have zero employee fatalities and reduce our osha total recordable incident rate 

• focus together this effort is the very core of our safety program and is designed to help frontline employees eliminate the six most common types of serious incidents 

• lead together we provide bestinclass communication channels and advanced training techniques for all frontline supervisors and managers to help them guide their teams 

• partner together staying safe requires involvement by employees at all levels we’ve increased leadership visits with frontline employees and supervisors to support each divisions’ safety goals

• analyze together we analyze realtime data to make short and longterm decisions and identify opportunities for improvement examples include analysis of roadway awareness training data mapping and other employee protection and preparedness insights 

• innovate together we employ the latest technologies in our fleet including automation rear cameras incab backup alarms and event recording systems and take a datadriven approach to support our employees we’re also working with equipment manufacturers to incorporate safety elements such as seat belt alarms blind spot awareness lane departure alarms and other potentially lifesaving equipment in our fleet 

we believe our safety amplified program will provide additional benefits for our company and stakeholders including 

• further strengthening relationships within the communities we service 

• enhancing customer trust

fleet automation 

approximately 77 of our residential routes have been converted to automated singledriver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

compressed natural gas cng vehicles 

approximately 21 of our fleet operates on cng approximately 13 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2021 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng vehicles reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2021 we operated over 40 cng fueling stations 

fleet electrification 

we are taking a leadership position in electric technology innovation for our fleet this is a critical step toward reducing our environmental impact through lower fleet emissions and we believe it will also improve our total cost of ownership while providing a competitive advantage in certain communities we are partnering with multiple manufacturers to pilot electricpowered recycling and solid waste trucks as electric vehicle technology continues to develop we will further deploy electrification to our fleet 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the fifth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2021 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 

onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet additionally our focus on preventative maintenance is improving the reliability of our fleet and enabling us to provide superior service to our customers differentiating us from our competition 

people and talent agenda 

being humancentered is at the core of our robust people and talent agenda we strive to maintain an environment that attracts and retains the best talent our over 35000 fulltime employees are a critical component in successfully executing our strategy and running our operations we aspire to always be a company where the best people with exceptional talents and diverse backgrounds can thrive and we foster a culture of caring where people feel respected supported and encouraged to bring their best selves to work

for inclusion and diversity this enables us to continue to develop new strategies and activities that are tied to the needs of our employees customers and business with the goal of creating an even more inclusive work environment and diverse workforce

employee engagement 

we believe an engaged workforce is a key element of our success as engaged employees deliver better customer service and are more productive we measure employee engagement through a thirdparty survey assessing employee sentiment on a variety of topics such as pride for the company job satisfaction and intention to stay our data reinforces that business units with a highly engaged workforce experience less turnover we also found that employees whose leaders are highly inclusive are more likely to speak up and share their perspective regularly hearing from our employees allows us to understand how to support and strengthen an exceptional employee experience our goal is to achieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030 our employee engagement score was approximately 84 in 2021 which is above national benchmarks by almost eight points approximately 98 of our employees participated in the engagement survey process in october 2021 which represented an alltime high participation rate compared to approximately 92 in april 2021 employee engagement is a core part of our business strategy which is why we compensate our general managers on their employee engagement scores this reinforces our commitment for leaders to listen and take action on employee feedback and helps to ensure that our leaders are held accountable and rewarded for their efforts to drive a more engaged workforce

integrated operations 

we have a strong national verticallyintegrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate where appropriate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling material streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 68 of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our 

markets that are not fully integrated through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific verticallyintegrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling processing centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing environmental services including the collection and processing of recyclable materials collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and other environmental solutions 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services through 356 collection operations in 2021 approximately 74 of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 22 of our total revenue related to residential services approximately 30 related to smallcontainer services and approximately 21 related to largecontainer services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of material for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills recycling processing centers or organics processing facilities we typically perform residential collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure through competitive bids which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer business we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform smallcontainer collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the material collected transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal our smallcontainer services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large generators of material we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the material collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer collection business the majority of the material relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

transfer services 

we own or operate 239 transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 6 of our revenue during 2021 our collection operations deposit material at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling processing centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate material and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional mechanism to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with material disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more material to the landfill or processing center in each trip 2 material is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the material to one of our own landfills or processing centers rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 198 active landfills our landfill tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue during 2021 as of december 31 2021 we had 39618 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of 50 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based 

on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however all proposed or future expansions may not be permitted 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits including reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2021 we operated 77 landfill gas and renewable energy projects the majority of these projects were developed and are owned by a third party 

we also have responsibility for 124 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling processing services 

we own or operate 71 recycling processing centers these centers generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 4 of our total revenue during 2021 approximately 80 of our total recycling processing center volume is fiber based and includes occ onp and other mixed paper during 2021 we processed and sold 22 million tons excluding glass and organics from our recycling processing centers an additional 21 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties we are investing in advanced recycling technology and have expanded our organics operations to help customers meet their diversion goals processing and selling 10 million tons of organic material from our recycling processing centers in 2021 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 22 million and 10 million respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or largecontainer customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty processing facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components into each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete material stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example robotics and advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

environmental solutions 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 3 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 3 treatment storage and disposal facilities 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells environmental solutions volume is generated by the daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities including maintenance plant turnarounds and capital projects additionally it is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity we provide these customers with environmentally responsible solutions to manage their waste needs including treatment consolidation and disposal of solid and liquid material field and industrial services rental and inplant services such as transportation and logistics in 2021 approximately 2 of our revenue was derived from environmental solutions 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the environmental services industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we 

compete with municipalities that maintain material collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering quality of service and price from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer and residential recycling and waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

we provide essential recycling and solid waste collection and disposal services in the communities we serve and our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather and natural disasters which could increase the volume of material collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of material reduce the volume of material delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities and may increase with the physical impacts of climate change the impacts from adverse weather and natural disasters have the potential to last several months and to affect several facilities we have business continuity plans in place for severe weather natural disasters and other emergencies—hurricanes tornadoes flooding winter storms earthquakes and wildfires among others—to help limit disruptions in our operations and help ensure the continuity of our services our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather and natural disasters which could increase the volume of material in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations recycling processing centers certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances any revocation modification or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

in order to comply with these regulations we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles landfills transfer stations and recycling processing centers and in connection with our capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements including changes relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures 

a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors further we compete with counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements citations and notices may be issued in the future notwithstanding our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however actual costs may exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

• the solid waste disposal act including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

subtitle c of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of hazardous waste and subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle c set requirements for hazardous waste generators transporters and treatment storage and disposal facilities regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards the epa may authorize states to implement certain hazardous waste requirements of subtitle c and if a state program does not exist the epa directly implements the hazardous waste requirements nearly all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitles c and d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitles c and d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitles c and d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitles c and d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

• the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances currently characterized by the epa as hazardous many of which are found in common household waste the epa may also designate additional substances as hazardous among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the federal water pollution control act of 1972 the clean water act this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publiclyowned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment 

works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities furthermore if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands we may be required to secure permits before such development starts in these situations permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 

• the clean air act the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed the date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill on july 14 2016 the epa issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate rule finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions were part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions as part of the biden administrations focus on climate change the epa has taken further steps to implement these regulations these and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions see item 1a risk factors – regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which is difficult to estimate  in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past decade the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 passenger automobiles and lightduty trucks collectively lightduty vehicles and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for lightduty vehicles in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for lightduty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal occurred in 2020 but has been challenged in court in 2021 the epa issued a rule further setting the standards for model years 2023 to 2026 making them more stringent in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life on august 5 2021 the epa announced its intent to move forward with a clean trucks plan which would involve setting emissions standards for model years 2027 and beyond 

• the occupational safety and health act of 1970 osha this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling 

or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste food waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting “extended producer responsibility” regulations which are designed to obligate producers to fund the postuse life cycle of their products by providing recycling programs for their products state and municipal governments may also enact “organic diversion” regulations that require food waste to be managed separately from the other waste streams similar to the rules recently enacted in california several states have also enacted or are considering “minimum recycled content” regulations mandating certain minimum postconsumer recycled content in certain types of packaging including california legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction and recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa these regulations may present new opportunities to offer sustainable environmental services to our customers but may require investment of time effort and money to be able to offer these new solutions and expose us to additional regulatory requirements and competition from others offering these services 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitles c and d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and our recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the m aterial cash requirements and intended uses of cash section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public we focus on operating safely and prudently but occasionally we receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business such insurance may not be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss and we may be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may choose not to continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with among other things municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

risks related to our business and operations 

the environmental services industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is typically based on the quality of services ease of doing business andor price competition for disposal business is primarily based on geographic location quality of operations and price one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers changes in refinery operations supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset increased fuel costs resulting from such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3830 million in 2021 or 34 of revenue compared to 2717 million in 2020 or 27 of revenue 

at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last decade regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for future years these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

part of our fleet of vehicles is powered by cng and we also operate cng fueling stations we have invested higher upfront capital costs in order to purchase and support our cng vehicles and fueling stations in order to reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses and to create a competitive advantage in communities that focus on protecting the environment cng is not yet widely adopted in north america as the cng industry develops new regulations the availability of alternative fuel technologies fluctuations in the price or availability of cng or reductions in tax incentives for the use of cng vehicles could substantially affect our revenue and costs of operations and reduce the benefits sought by investing in cng vehicles and fueling stations 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control for instance in 2017 the chinese government imposed strict limits on the import of recyclable materials including by restricting the amount of contaminants allowed in imported recycled paper these limitations significantly decreased the global demand for recyclable materials and resulted in lower commodity prices significant price fluctuations or increased operating costs may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2021 approximately 80 of our recycling processing center volume was fiber based and included occ onp and other mixed paper 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 22 million and 10 million on an annual basis respectively accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could materially affect our revenue and operating income although we have entered into hedging agreements to help offset volatility in recycled commodity prices in the past we may not enter into these agreements in the future 

acute and chronic weather events including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection transfer disposal and other environmental services we provide 

our operations could be adversely impacted by extreme weather events changing weather patterns and rising mean temperature and sea levels some of which we are already experiencing for example we have operations in multiple states that are affected by hurricanes and we have seen the impact of storms and associated flooding in our daytoday operations and our infrastructure the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which includes more than 1300 scientists from the united states and other countries forecasts a temperature rise of 25° to 10° fahrenheit over the next century changing weather patterns and rising temperatures are expected to result in more severe heat waves fires storms and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of material collected or processed under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation impede our employees and equipments ability to operate disrupt our supply chain delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of material generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the environmental services industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required for our operations because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills or increase acceptable volume at transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or 

seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage such actions could also create risks related to our reputation which may limit our ability to do business responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills and some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering waste reduction regulations such as extended producer responsibility organic diversion and minimum recycled content regulations although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of environmental services including the operation of our facilities a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we 

carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to work stoppages and other workforce effects which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 24 of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements if our unionrepresented employees engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have experienced interrupted service when our unionrepresented employees have engaged in strikes and work stoppages in the past and we would expect the same to occur as a result of any future strikes or work stoppages additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future which could result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionrepresented our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

we may not be able to achieve reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions and our other sustainability goals 

climate change and other sustainability matters are embedded in our core value and vision as part of our strategic longterm plans to address sustainability we are committed to reducing our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35 by 2030 among other sustainability goals the execution of our plans and achievement of our goals are subject to risks and uncertainties including our ability to develop obtain license or scale the innovations technologies and modeling and measurement tools that may be necessary to achieve our plans and the availability cost and benefits of materials and infrastructure associated with our sustainability projects such as our cng vehicles fleet electrification recycling circularity of key materials landfill gastoenergy and other renewable energy projects 

in addition increasing governmental and societal attention to sustainability matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change waste production water usage human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these and other rapidly changing laws regulations policies and related interpretations as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies create challenges for us if we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations and meet the sustainability values standards and metrics that we set for ourselves it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results 

risks related to our legal and regulatory environment 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of material air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to among other things enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we may not be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes including those relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the epa has indicated it is considering listing certain pfas as hazardous substances under cercla which if finalized could trigger additional obligations or liabilities under cercla or other laws and regulations 

our business is and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which is difficult to estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things 

carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas while passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation appears unlikely in the near term we expect any such legislation if enacted to impose costs on our operations which could be material 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa has taken certain actions administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to lightduty vehicles through model year 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal took place in 2020 but has been challenged in court on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 these standards and further federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills as part of the biden administration focus on climate change the epa has taken further steps to implement these regulations these regulations or an amended version of them that eventually goes into effect may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot predict what other actions or regulations the current administration may undertake that would affect our industry 

we may incur losses from liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur liabilities or suffer losses arising from our operations or properties that resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public we maintain insurance for these liabilities and losses including high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability or loss in connection with these contingencies our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability or loss this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by businesses we have acquired environmental laws or regulations may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to 

lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

risks related to financial strategy and indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 10 billion in principal value of debt and finance leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other environmental services businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we may not succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or be able to continue our share repurchase program 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental entities large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy including contractions caused by the covid19 pandemic reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental entities we provide services to a number of these entities including numerous municipalities these governmental entities may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or environmental services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results the liabilities we record based on such estimates and assumptions may not be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 12 employee benefit plans of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our growth strategy 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

• desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified 

• we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified 

• we will effectively integrate and manage companies we acquire or 

• any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 

if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company with undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification by obtaining representations and warranties insurance and by acquiring only specified 

assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage or that any indemnification or insurance coverage obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

risks related to technology and intellectual property 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of our three differentiating capabilities is to enable our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings further any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws 

emerging technologies including those that are used to recycle and process waste as an alternative to disposal of waste in landfills represent risks as well as opportunities to our current business model the costs associated with developing or investing in emerging technologies could require substantial capital and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows delays in the development or implementation of such emerging technologies and difficulties in marketing new products or services based on emerging technologies could have similar negative impacts our financial results may suffer if we are not able to develop or license emerging technologies or if a competitor obtains exclusive rights to an emerging technology that disrupts the current methods used in the environmental services industry 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use information technology including computer and information networks in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information in connection with our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective also the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements this changing regulatory landscape may cause increasingly complex compliance challenges which may increase our compliance costs any failure to comply with these changing security and privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties fines legal challenges and reputational harm the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

other risks relevant to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted and is likely to continue to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy our supply chain partners our employees and our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic our costs of doing business have increased including for the purchase of additional safety equipment and hygiene products increased facility and equipment cleaning and the expansion of certain aspects of our existing healthcare programs additionally if the pandemic continues and conditions worsen or if there is a large outbreak or resurgence of covid19 in various regions we expect to experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities and our collections of accounts receivable which adverse impacts may be material the degree to which covid19 impacts our results going forward will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not 

limited to the duration variants and spread of covid19 its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume any of the foregoing factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our business and damage our results of operations and our liquidity position possibly to a significant degree 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects in some of our markets we compete with other similar businesses which may drive labor costs or reduce the amount of available qualified personnel 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations such as for example those related to our asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

weakened global economic conditions including those resulting from the recent covid19 pandemic may harm our industry business and results of operations 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest ra tes for example the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets a weak economy generally results in decrea ses in volumes which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have certain fixed costs eg facility expense associated with longterm leases depreciation expense and accretion expense which may be difficult to adjust quickly to match declining volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally a decline in volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings 

general legal proceedings 

we are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements in the normal course of our business we become involved in legal proceedings some may result in fines penalties or judgments against us or settlements which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

in midmarch 2020 certain customers in our small and largecontainer businesses began adjusting their service levels which included a decrease in the frequency of pickups or a temporary pause in service in addition we experienced a decline in volumes disposed at certain of our landfills and transfer stations as service levels decreased we also experienced a decrease in certain costs of our operations which are variable in nature this decline in service activity peaked in the first half of april 2020 and improved sequentially through december 31 2021 

in april 2020 we launched our committed to serve initiative and committed 20 million to support frontline employees and 

their families as well as small business customers in the local communities where we serve in addition to this initiative we 

have experienced an increase in certain costs of doing business as a direct result of the covid19 pandemic including costs 

for additional safety equipment and hygiene products and increased facility and equipment cleaning these costs are intended to 

assist in protecting the safety of our frontline employees as we continue to provide an essential service to our customers in 

2020 and 2021 we recognized our frontline employees for their commitment and contributions to their communities during the pandemic with awards that were paid in january 2021 and november 2021 respectively in addition we incurred incremental costs associated with expanding certain aspects of our existing healthcare programs we may continue to incur similar costs in future years although we expect the annual amount of such costs to be less than those incurred in 2020 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business are described in more detail in the results of operations discussion in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 112 to 112950 million compared to 101536 million in 2020 this change in revenue is due to increased volume of 38 average yield of 29 acquisitions net of divestitures of 28 recycling processing and commodity sales of 11 and fuel recovery fees of 08 partially offset by decreased environmental solutions revenue of 01 additionally revenue decreased 01 due to one less workday in 2021 as compared to 2020

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers including the collection and processing of recyclable materials collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and other environmental solutions our residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties our recycling processing centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from environmental solutions consists mainly of fees we charge for 

disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid and liquid material and inplant services such as transportation and logistics 

including at our tsdfs other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities fuel recovery fees and environmental solutions revenue to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 31 and 28 for 2021 and 2020 respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 53 and 51 for 2021 and 2020 respectively 

during 2021 we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2020 

• average yield increased revenue by 29 due to positive pricing changes in all lines of business 

• the fuel recovery fee program which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices increased revenue by 08 primarily due to an increase in fuel prices compared to the same period in 2020 and an increase in the total revenue subject to the fuel recovery fees 

• volume increased revenue by 38 during 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to volume growth in our landfill transfer and small and largecontainer collection lines of business partially offset by a decline in residential collection volumes the volume increase in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to increased solid and special waste event driven volumes in midmarch 2020 certain customers in these lines of business began adjusting their services levels as a result of the covid19 pandemic this decline in service activity peaked in the first half of april 2020 and sequentially improved thereafter these increases were partially offset by one less workday as compared to 2020 

• recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 11 primarily due to an increase in overall commodity prices as compared to 2020 the average price for recycled commodities excluding glass and organics for 2021 was 187 per ton compared to 96 per ton for 2020 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 22 million and 10 million respectively 

• during 2021 environmental solutions decreased revenue by 01 primarily due to a decrease in rig counts drilling activity and the delay of inplant project work as a result of lower demand for crude oil which began in 2020 

• acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 28 due to our continued growth strategy of acquiring privately held environmental services companies that complement our existing business platform 

cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our material to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide environmental services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management costs which include insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by component to that of other companies and of ours for prior periods 

our cost of operations increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 as a result of the following 

• labor and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases and an increase in service levels attributable to the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic this increase was partially offset by one less workday during 2021 as compared to 2020 

• transfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars as a result of higher collection volumes and an increase in third party disposal rates during both 2021 and 2020 approximately 68 of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 

• maintenance and repairs expense increased in aggregate dollars due to an increase in service levels attributable to the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic 

• transportation and subcontract costs increased primarily due to higher collection and transfer station volumes acquisitionrelated activity and increased subcontract work attributable to an increase in noncore revenues partially offset by one less workday during 2021 as compared to 2020 

• fuel costs increased due to an increase in the average diesel fuel cost per gallon the national average cost per gallon for diesel fuel in 2021 was 329 compared to 255 for 2020 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million per year 

• disposal fees and taxes increased in aggregate dollars due to an increase in service levels attributable to the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic 

• risk management expenses increased primarily due to unfavorable actuarial development in our auto liability claims as well as higher premium costs partially offset by favorable workers compensation development in prior year programs 

• during 2020 we recognized an insurance recovery of 108 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri which we recognized as a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations in our consolidated statement of income 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions an increase in the cost of replacement vehicles and container assets as well as increased capital expenditures on vehicles to support volume growth 

landfill depletion and amortization increased due to higher landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by increased solid and special waste volumes coupled with increased depletion rates additionally we recognized favorable amortization adjustments related to our asset retirement obligations in 2020 that did not recur in 2021 

amortization of other intangible assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were 333 million or 03 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 212 million or 02 of revenue for 2020 our other intangible assets primarily relate to customer relationships and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization expense increased due to additional assets acquired as a result of our business acquisitions 

amortization of other assets 

expenses for amortization of other assets were 405 million or 04 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 388 million or 04 of revenue for 2020 our other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloudbased hosting arrangements 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 827 million or 07 of revenue and 829 million or 08 of revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties legal settlements marketing investor and community relations services directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges restructuring charges are excluded from selling general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately 

the following table summarizes our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies and of ours for prior periods 

the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative expenses during 2021 as compared to 2020 are summarized below 

• salaries and related benefits increased primarily due to higher management incentive expenses as a result of outperforming our annual incentive metrics 

• in 2021 the provision for doubtful accounts decreased as a result of an improved trend in historical collections our days sales outstanding changed from 392 or 275 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2021 compared to 386 or 264 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2020 

• other selling general and administrative expenses increased during 2021 primarily due to an increase in recruiting advertising and bank fees meetings and events expenses also increased during 2021 following a decrease in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees acquisition deal costs and unfavorable changes in certain legal reserves during 2020 which did not recur in 2021 

• during 2021 we recognized a charge of 220 million primarily related to the accelerated vesting of donald w slagers compensation awards that were previously scheduled to vest in 2022 and beyond as a result of his retirement as chief executive officer ceo of republic services inc in june 2021 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds 

during 2020 we recorded charges to earnings of 345 million for withdrawal events at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute we paid 344 million during 2020 relative to these withdrawal events as we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

loss gain on business divestitures and impairments net 

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets business divestitures could result in gains losses or impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

during 2021 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 05 million which was due to business divestitures in certain markets during 2020 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 777 million including 426 million resulting from managements decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business 

restructuring charges 

in 2020 we incurred costs related to the redesign of certain backoffice software systems which continued into 2021 in addition in july 2020 we eliminated certain backoffice support positions in response to a decline in the underlying demand for services resulting from the covid19 pandemic during 2021 and 2020  we incurred restructuring charges of 166 million and 200 million respectively we paid 172 million and 155 million during 2021 and 2020  respectively related to these restructuring efforts 

in 2022 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 20 million primarily related to the redesign of certain of our backoffice software systems substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate entities and other segment 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 

total interest expense for 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating and fixed rate debt the decrease attributable to our fixed rate debt is primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in 2020 with coupons ranging from 0875 to 3050 the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding senior notes with coupons ranging from 3550 to 5500 

during 2021 and 2020 cash paid for interest excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps was 2494 million and 3251 million respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during 2020 we incurred a 1019 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt we paid total cash premiums during the year totaling 991 million and incurred noncash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs of 28 million  

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 2828 million and 1731 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively our effective income tax rate was 180 and 152 for 2021 and 2020 respectively we made income tax payments net of refunds of approximately 300 million and 124 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively income taxes paid in 2021 and 2020 reflect benefits from tax credits from our continuing investments in solar energy for 2020 cash taxes paid reflect benefits from 100 bonus depreciation on qualified assets 

during 2021 we acquired noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investment in loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting see note 3 business acquisitions investments and restructuring charges  our 2021 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately 126 million due to the tax credits related to these investments 

our 2020 tax provision was reduced by 116 million from excess tax benefits related to stock compensation approximately 100 million related to the tax credits from our noncontrolling interest in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets 172 million for adjustments to our valuation allowance due to the realizability of certain state loss carryforwards and 82 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2019 tax returns 

we have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately 87 million available as of december 31 2021 these state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2022 and 2041 we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states in recognition of this risk as of december 31 2021 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 43 million 

reportable segments 

our senior management evaluates the financial performance of our operations through three operating segments group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states our environmental solutions operating segment which provides environmental solutions for daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities is aggregated with corporate entities and other as it only represents approximately 2 of our consolidated revenue each operating segment provides integrated environmental services including collection transfer recycling and disposal 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 

financial information for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects the transfer of our environmental solutions operating segment from group 2 to corporate entities and other to align with how our chief operating decision maker began evaluating our operations in december 2020 

corporate entities and other include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills other administrative functions and environmental solutions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations

revenue for 2021 increased 99 from 2020 due to an increase in both average yield and volume in all lines of business 

operating income in group 1 increased from 13433 million for 2020 or a 266 operating margin to 14957 million for 2021 or a 269 operating margin operating income margin during 2021 was favorably impacted by the increase in revenue 

attributable to economic recovery coupled with the effective management of certain operating costs this benefit was partially offset by an increase in fuel costs 

group 2 

revenue for 2021 increased 113 from 2020 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business additionally volume increased in our landfill transfer station and small and largecontainer collection lines of business partially offset by volume declines in our residential line of business 

operating income in group 2 increased from 9668 million for 2020 or a 202 operating margin to 11357 million for 2021 or a 213 operating margin operating income margin for 2021 was favorably impacted by the increase in revenue attributable to economic recovery coupled with the effective management of certain operating costs this benefit was partially offset by an increase in fuel costs 

corporate entities and other 

the corporate entities and other operating loss decreased from 6010 million for 2020 to 5552 million for 2021 during 2021 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 05 million during 2020 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 777 million including 426 million resulting from management’s decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment transportation and disposal costs methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in cost estimates available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

available airspace 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we owned or operated 198 and 186 active solid waste landfills respectively with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 50 billion inplace cubic yards in both years for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity as measured in cubic yards of airspace 



total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 11 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these 11 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 33 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 59 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2021 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2021 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 15073 million of which 684 million were current and 14389 million were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in 2020 we recognized an insurance recovery of 108 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations 

for a description of our significant remediation matters see note 8 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

investment in landfills 

as of december 31 2021 we expect to spend an estimated additional 96 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 138 billion or 275 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

the following table reflects our future expected investment as of december 31 2021 in millions 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

during 2021 and 2020 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based primarily on a threeyear historical moving average 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars 







liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and marketable securities balances as of december 31 

our restricted cash and marketable securities include among other things restricted cash related to proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds that will be used to fund qualifying landfillrelated expenditures in the commonwealth of pennsylvania restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts and permits and relating to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

the following table summarizes our restricted cash and marketable securities as of december 31 

material cash requirements and intended uses of cash 

we expect existing cash cash equivalents restricted cash and marketable securities cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future our known current and longterm uses of cash include among other possible demands 1 capital expenditures and leases 2 acquisitions 3 dividend payments 4 share repurchases 5 repayments to service debt and other longterm obligations and 6 payments for asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 

capital expenditures and leases 

we make investments in property and equipment primarily to allow for growth of our service offerings these investments are largely concentrated in vehicles and equipment and costs to construct our landfills we expect to spend approximately 13 billion on capital expenditures in 2022 

we lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of business under various lease agreements the most significant lease obligations are for real property and equipment specific to our industry including property operated as a landfill or transfer station and operating equipment as of december 31 2021 the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was 3154 million and 4336 million respectively for additional detail regarding our lease obligations see note 10 leases  of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

acquisitions 

our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform we continue to invest in valueenhancing acquisitions in existing markets in 2022 we expect to invest at least 500 million in acquisitions 

dividend payments 

in october 2021 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 046 per share aggregate cash dividends declared were 5630 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of 1459 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 3 2022 which was paid on january 14 2022 

share repurchases 

in october 2020 our board of directors approved a 20 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting january 1 2021 and extending through december 31 2023 share repurchases under the current program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws while the board of directors has approved the program the timing of any purchases the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management at its discretion and will depend upon market conditions and other factors the share repurchase program may be extended suspended or discontinued at any time as of december 31 2021 the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our october 2020 repurchase program was 17 billion 

debt and other longterm obligations 

debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw on our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

as of december 31 2021 the total principal value of our debt was 97 billion of which 82 million is due in 2022 

we have several agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at thirdparty disposal facilities under these putorpay agreements we must pay for agreedupon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities 

our unconditional purchase commitments have varying expiration dates with some extending through the remaining life of the respective landfill future minimum payments under unconditional purchase commitments consisting primarily of 1 disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements as of december 31 2021 such purchase commitments which do not qualify for recognition on our consolidated balance sheets amount to 7723 million of which 1426 million is shortterm 

for additional detail regarding our debt and known contractual and other obligation see note 9 debt and note 19 commitments and contingencies  of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 

we have future obligations for final capping closure and postclosure costs with respect to the landfills we own or operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits as of december 31 2021 our future obligations for final capping closure and postclosure costs totaled 15 billion of which 684 million was shortterm 

additionally we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs as of december 31 2021 our environmental liabilities totaled 4549 million of which 561 million was shortterm 

for additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

summary of cash flow activity 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2021 and 2020 are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2021 and 2020 are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 940 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of 1299 million in 2020 primarily as a result of the following 

• our accounts receivable exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits increased 1354 million during 2021 compared to a 138 million decrease in 2020 as of december 31 2021 our days sales outstanding were 392 or 275 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2021 compared to 386 or 264 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2020 

• our prepaid expenses and other assets increased 570 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of 65 million in 2020 primarily due to additional saas implementation costs incurred related to the redesign of certain backoffice software systems in 2021 the decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to the receipt of the bridgeton landfill settlement in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in alternative fuel tax credit receipts during 2020 compared to 2019 partially offset by an increase of prepaid taxes due to the timing of our estimated tax payments we made income tax payments net of refunds of approximately 300 million and 124 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively income taxes paid in 2021 and 2020 reflected benefits from tax credits from our continuing investments in solar energy in 2020 cash taxes paid also reflected a benefit from 100 bonus depreciation on qualified assets 

• our accounts payable increased 1138 million during 2021 compared to a decrease of 467 million during 2020 due to the timing of payments 

• cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations was 10 million higher during 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and postclosure payments at certain of our landfill sites 

• cash paid for remediation obligations was 64 million lower during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to 189 million in payments related to management and monitoring of the remediation area of our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri during 2021 as compared to 256 million of payments during 2020 

in addition cash paid for interest was 2494 million and 3251 million excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps for 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2021 and 2020 are summarized below 

• capital expenditures during 2021 were 13163 million as compared to 11946 million for 2020 

• proceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2021 were 195 million as compared to 301 million for 2020 

• during 2021 and 2020 we used 12217 million and 7695 million respectively for acquisitions and investments net of cash acquired during 2021 and 2020 we received 463 million and 329 million from business divestitures respectively 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings 

on february 8 2022 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of us ecology inc us ecology in a transaction valued at approximately 22 billion including debt us ecology is a leading provider of environmental solutions offering treatment recycling and disposal of hazardous nonhazardous and specialty waste we intend to finance the transaction using existing and new sources of debt 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2021 and 2020 are summarized below 

• during 2021 we issued 7000 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 6923 million during 2020 we issued 27500 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 27161 million net payments of notes payable and longterm debt were 1502 million during 2021 compared to net payments of 25959 in 2020 for a more detailed discussion see the financial condition section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• during 2020 we paid 991 million in cash premiums on the redemption of senior notes 

• during 2021 we repurchased 22 million shares of our stock for 2522 million during 2020 we repurchased 12 million shares of our stock for 988 million

• during 2021 and 2020 cash paid for purchase price holdback releases and contingent purchase price related to acquisitions was 213 million and 155 million respectively 

financial condition 

debt obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 82 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months which includes certain finance lease obligations all of our taxexempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us 

in the event of a failed remarketing we currently have availability under our 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

an extended period of economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic could further disrupt the global supply chain negatively impact demand for our services and disrupt financial markets these effects could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition including our access to sources of liquidity we will continue to monitor the evolving covid19 pandemic along with the effect on our business and access to capital markets refer to part i item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risk factors related to this pandemic 

for further discussion of the components of our overall debt see note 9 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

credit facilities 

the credit facility 

in august 2021 we entered into a 30 billion uns ecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which replaces the prior 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which would have matured in june 2023 the replaced credit facility borrowings under the credit facility mature in august 2026 as permitted by the credit facility we have the right to request two oneyear extensions of the maturity date but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension the credit facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 10 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 

at our option borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate a daily floating london interbank offered rate libor or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 0910 based on our debt ratings all as defined in the credit facility agreement on the earliest of i the date that all available tenors of us dollar libor have permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided or have been announced to be no longer representative ii june 30 2023 or iii the effective date of an election to opt into a secured overnight financing rate sofr the libor rate will be replaced by a forwardlooking term rate based on sofr or a daily rate based on sofr published on such date 

the credit facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the credit facility agreement and the aggregate commitment regardless of usage availability under our credit facility and replaced credit facility totaled 26338 million and 16718 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the credit facility can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes the credit facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 243 million and 1860 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and replaced credit facility respectively we had 3419 million an d 3765 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility and replaced credit facility as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

uncommitted credit facility 

in january 2022 we entered into a 2000 million unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facility the uncommitted credit facility which replaces the prior 1350 million uncommitted credit facility the replaced uncommitted credit facility the uncommitted credit facility bears interest at an annual percentage rate to be agreed upon by both parties rather than a libor or cost of funds rate used in the replaced uncommitted credit facility as defined in the replaced uncommitted credit facility agreement borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility can be used for working capital letters of credit and other general corporate purposes the agreement governing our uncommitted credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under our replaced uncommitted credit facility 

financial and other covenants 

the credit facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the credit facility and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity the credit facility provides that our total debt to ebitda ratio may not exceed 375 to 100 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter in the case of an elevated ratio period which may be elected by us if one or more acquisitions during a fiscal quarter involve aggregate consideration in excess of 2000 million the trigger quarter the total debt to ebitda ratio may not exceed 425 to 100 during the trigger quarter and for the three fiscal quarters thereafter the credit facility also provides that there may not be more than two elevated ratio periods during the respective term of the credit facility agreement as of december 31 2021 our total debt to 

ebitda ratio was 289 compared to the 375 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2022 

ebitda which is a nongaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreement in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the credit facility as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and wou ld allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit facility agreement this could have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility agreement for relief from the financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the credit facility agreement or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated 

senior notes and debentures 

in november 2021 we issued 7000 million of 2375 senior notes due 2033 the 2375 notes we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including repayment of amounts outstanding under our unsecured and uncommitted credit facilities prior to such use republic may have temporarily invested the net proceeds in marketable securities and shortterm investments 

during the second quarter of 2021 we paid the entire 353 million principal balance of our 9250 debentures which matured in may 2021 

our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations interest is payable semiannually 

derivative instruments and hedging relationships 

our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy historically we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt from time to time we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate fair value hedges or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances cash flow hedges 

for a description of our derivative contracts and hedge accounting see note 9 debt  to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2021 we had 11815 million of certain variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2051 as of december 31 2020 we had 11047 million of certain variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2050 during the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we issued 2050 million and 600 million respectively of new taxexempt financings 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 the pennsylvania economic development financing authority issued for our benefit 300 million of solid waste disposal revenue bonds the proceeds from the issuance after deferred issuance costs will be used to fund qualifying landfillrelated expenditures in the commonwealth of pennsylvania of which 172 million has been incurred and reimbursed to us as of december 31 2021 we had 1390 million of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 124 million represented proceeds from the issuance of the taxexempt bonds 

finance leases 

we had finance lease liabilities of 2494 million and 2065 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively with maturities ranging from 2022 to 2063 and 2021 to 2063 respectively 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 

the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2022 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the estimates that are subject to uncertainty in the accounting for these areas below 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

• landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 

• landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping closure and postclosure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

landfill development costs 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had net landfill development costs of 39140 million and 37422 million respectively changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in cost estimates inflation and applicable regulations 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 

• studies performed could be inaccurate which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 

• actions by neighboring parties private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain maintain or expand permits could result in denial revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit improved technical information as a project progresses or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment 

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 

• technical design requirements as approved may need modifications at some future point in time 

• technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 

• the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions including waste compaction practices site design climate and the nature of the waste 

• capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in yearoveryear cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• actual future costs of construction materials and thirdparty labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions regulatory changes or legislative changes 

landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates may be sensitive to the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and 

value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our asset retirement obligations related to capping closure and postclosure were 15073 million and 13464 million respectively changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in available airspace cost estimates inflation our creditadjusted riskfree interest rate and applicable regulations 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in each landfills technical design which is reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency issuing the landfill site permit 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 17 in both 2021 and 2020 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 34 in both 2021 and 2020 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book 

value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping closure activities or postclosure monitoring activities types and quantities of materials used or term of postclosure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 

• changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 

• actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping closure and postclosure liabilities 

• changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 

• changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the creditadjusted riskfree rate used to discount the liabilities which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities assets and expense 

• amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design postclosure monitoring requirements or the inflation or discount rate 

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

• we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement 

• we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources 

• there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project including political impediments 

• progress is being made on the project 

• the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame and 

• we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit 

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for 

probable expansion disposal capacity or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure accruals an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 

environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in certain business combinations environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in certain business combinations are initially estimated on a discounted basis and accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 4549 million and 4628 million of environmental liabilities changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in cost estimates timing of estimated costs and settlements inflation our creditadjusted riskfree interest rate and applicable regulations 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events thus our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified the financial viability of those parties and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any adjustments could be material 

• actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 

• an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of income 

insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million to 10 million the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a highdeductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our insurance reserves were 4974 million and 4493 million respectively changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in the frequency severity and settlement amount of claims 

these estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to 

• incident rates including frequency and severity and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change which would be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 

• recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims adjustments if any to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

• the settlement costs to discharge our obligations including legal and health care costs could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our insurance reserves to change

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor or following the termination of libor sofr we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change we have historically entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forwardlooking statement 

the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 1239 million 

as of december 31 2021 we had 12134 million of floating rate debt and 3000 million of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 15 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk as of december 31 2021 we had no fuel hedges in place while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3830 million in 2021 or 34 of revenue compared to 2717 million in 2020 or 27 of revenue 

commodities price risk 

we market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling processing centers changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices in prior periods we have entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities as of december 31 2021 we had no recycling commodity hedges in place 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 22 million and 10 million respectively 

revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 4205 million and 2971 million respectively

 item 1 business 

overview 

republic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2020 we operated facilities in 41 states through 345 collection operations 220 transfer stations 186 active landfills 76 recycling processing centers 6 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 9 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells we are engaged in 75 landfill gastoenergy and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 128 closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

we believe the total addressable environmental services market in which we operate generates approximately 87 billion of annual revenue which includes the 67 billion us recycling and solid waste industry and 20 billion of the broader environmental services industry within our recycling and solid waste business we prioritize investments in market verticals with above average growth rates and higher return profiles environmental services remains fragmented which provides consolidation opportunities to drive scale we believe we will be able to further expand our addressable market into other segments of the environmental services industry over time by leveraging our differentiated capabilities 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of material is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

we believe that our products and services are valuable to our customers and essential for longterm sustainability our focus and commitment to sustainability allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase customer loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has impacted the global economy as well as certain aspects of our operations and performance during this time we continued to provide essential services to our customers while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees in april 2020 we launched our committed to serve initiative to help our employees customers and communities across the united states the impact of covid19 on our business and associated costs are discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10k 

foundational elements 

our strategy is designed to generate profitable growth by sustainably managing our customers’ needs and it is underpinned by three foundational elements – 1 our market position 2 operating model and 3 management of human capital through our people and talent agenda 

market position 

our goal is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 

• volume growth  we believe volumes are driven by population growth household formation and new business formation volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting recyclable and solid waste material under residential collection contracts with municipalities exclusive franchise agreements and smallcontainer and largecontainer contracts we also look to enter into longterm disposal and recycling processing contracts with 

table of contents 

municipalities and other third parties by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at a rate consistent with the underlying economic growth in these markets in addition by securing longterm agreements we are better able to help ensure we earn an appropriate return on the capital deployed 

• price increases  we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in vehicles equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling processing centers 

• expansion of recycling capabilities  based on the most recent us environmental protection agency epa data we believe approximately 32 of municipal solid waste is recycled and composted and we expect that percentage to increase over the longterm while there are examples of communities cancelling their recycling programs many more communities remain committed to enhancing and expanding their recycling programs for their residents we continue to focus on innovative material handling processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an appropriate return we will continue to look for opportunities to expand or enhance our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services and demonstrating a willingness to pay and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

• infrastructure development  we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as a vertically integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated our goal is to create marketspecific vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations landfills and recycling processing centers where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling processing centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites additionally we seek opportunities to expand and permit new airspace at our existing landfills in order to replace airspace consumed development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

external growth 

• acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships  our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privatelyheld companies including increasing competition in the environmental services industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in regulatory requirements and technology and the limited number of exit strategies for privatelyheld companies we also evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publiclyowned companies 

we continue to invest in valueenhancing acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 200 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the recycling and waste operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe over time we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they seek to raise capital andor reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

our operating model allows us to deliver a consistent highquality service to all our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business key elements of our operating model are our organizational structure safety fleet automation compressed natural gas vehicles fleet electrification and standardized maintenance 

organizational structure 

a key enabler of the republic way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by 

table of contents 

maintaining 360degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

through this operating model we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way 

safety 

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve we have a dedicated team of safety professionals at our corporate headquarters and in our field operations the leader of which reports directly to our chief operating officer due to the nature of our industry we make safety a top priority and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 10 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 39 better than the industry average our think choose live slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think about what you are doing choose the safe answer and live to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition in which they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

through our safety amplified program we are providing even more tools and driving even greater awareness to help our teams better execute our safety standards regular training multifaceted programs and strategic partnerships are key components to this program it is simple by design and comprised of actions and activities that ensure safety is embedded in all we do the program includes six initiatives to help us achieve our goal to have zero employee fatalities and reduce our osha total recordable incident rate 

• focus together this is our core safety program created for our frontline employees and designed to help eliminate six types of serious incidents we recently extended the scope and reach of the program to include all employees across the company 

• lead together this focus area brings bestinclass communication channels to our employees and includes advanced training techniques for all supervisors and managers 

• partner together were initiating more frequent and higher quality leadership visits and interaction with frontline employees these visits are designed to pull together leaders from a variety of departments to support the divisions safety goals 

• celebrate together we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award the national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year republic drivers have won 70 of the driver of the year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009 in addition our best drivers are recognized and rewarded with competing in our national roadeo competition 

• analyze together we analyze realtime data to make short and longterm decisions and identify opportunities for improvement examples include analysis of roadway awareness training data mapping and other employee protection and preparedness insights with these analytics we will be able to make proactive safety decisions to generate better results 

• innovate together we leverage the latest technologies including automation and take a datadriven approach to support our employees these innovations include rear cameras incab backing alarm systems and event recording systems throughout our fleet we’re also working with equipment manufacturers to incorporate safety elements such as seat belt alarms blind spot awareness lane departure alarms and other potentially lifesaving equipment in our fleet 

we believe our safety amplified program will provide additional benefits for our company and stakeholders including 

1 further strengthening relationships within the communities we service 

2 enhancing customer trust 

3 streamlining operational processes and increasing productivity 

4 delivering a reputational advantage including positioning our company as an employerofchoice 

5 building and sustaining a safety culture in all areas of our business and 

6 contributing to employee engagement

fleet automation 

approximately 77 of our residential routes have been converted to automated singledriver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

compressed natural gas cng vehicles 

approximately 21 of our fleet operates on natural gas approximately 13 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2020 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2020 we operated 38 cng fueling stations 

fleet electrification 

we are taking a leadership position in electric technology innovation for our fleet this is a critical step toward reducing our environmental impact through lower fleet emissions and we believe it will also improve our total cost of ownership while providing a competitive advantage in certain communities we are partnering with multiple manufacturers to pilot electricpowered recycling and solid waste trucks in addition we are working with an electric battery manufacturer to retrofit dieselpowered trucks we will apply what we learn from these programs to future electrification initiatives 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the fifth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2020 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs additionally our focus on preventative maintenance is improving the reliability of our fleet and enabling us to provide superior service to our customers differentiating us from our competition the entire fleet was certified under onefleet in 2017 

human capital management

goal of creating an even more inclusive work environment and diverse workforce 

we support inclusion and connectivity for our diverse populations through our business resource groups including women of republic valor veterans advocacy learning outreach and recruiting and the black employee network ben which we launched in early 2020 when the nation experienced an inflection point in race relations in 2020 we were wellpositioned to address the call for social justice because it aligns with our value of respect and is reinforced by our existing commitment to advancing and supporting black employees and black communities

employee engagement 

we believe an engaged workforce is the greatest indicator of our success we measure employee engagement through a third party survey assessing employee sentiment on a variety of topics such as pride for the company job satisfaction and intention to stay we have found that business units with a highly engaged workforce experience less turnover we have also found that employees whose leaders are highly inclusive are more likely to speak up and share their perspective in addition we believe that engaged employees deliver better customer service and are more productive which is directly tied to the success of our business our goal is to achieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030 our employee engagement score was approximately 85 in 2020 which was consistent with our score in 2019 approximately 92 of our employees participated in the engagement survey process in 2020 which represented an alltimehigh participation rate compared to approximately 84 in 2019 employee engagement is a core part of our business strategy which is why we compensate our general managers on their employee engagement scores this helps to ensure that our leaders are held accountable and rewarded for their efforts to drive a more engaged workforce

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing environmental services companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and 

table of contents 

meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we have a strong national verticallyintegrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate where appropriate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling material streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 68 of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific verticallyintegrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling processing centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing environmental services including the collection and processing of recyclable materials collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and other environmental solutions 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services through 345 collection operations in 2020 approximately 75 of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 23 of our total revenue related to residential services approximately 31 related to smallcontainer services and approximately 22 related to largecontainer services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of material for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling processing centers we typically perform residential collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure through competitive bids which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer business we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform smallcontainer collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the material collected transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal our smallcontainer services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large generators of material we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the material collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer collection business the majority of the material relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

transfer services 

we own or operate 220 transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 6 of our revenue during 2020 our collection operations deposit material at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling processing 

table of contents 

centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate material and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional mechanism to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with material disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more material to the landfill or processing center in each trip 2 material is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the material to one of our own landfills or processing centers rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 186 active landfills our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue during 2020 as of december 31 2020 we had 38481 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of 50 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2020 we operated 75 landfill gas and renewable energy projects the majority of these projects were developed and are owned by a third party 

we also have responsibility for 128 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 76 recycling processing centers these centers generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 3 of our revenue during 2020 approximately 78 of our total recycling processing center volume is fiber based and includes occ onp and other mixed paper during 2020 we processed and sold 21 million tons excluding glass and organics from our recycling processing centers an additional 22 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately 12 million 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or largecontainer customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty processing facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete material stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example robotics and advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

environmental solutions 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 6 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 9 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells environmental solutions volume is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity additionally it is generated by the daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities including maintenance plant turnarounds and capital projects we provide these customers with environmentally responsible solutions to manage their waste needs including disposal of solid and liquid materials and inplant services such as transportation and logistics in 2020 approximately 1 of our revenue was derived from environmental solutions 

table of contents 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the environmental services industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain material collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering quality of service and price from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer and residential recycling and waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of material collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of material reduce the volume of material delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of material in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations recycling centers certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances any revocation modification or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

in order to comply with these regulations we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles landfills transfer stations and recycling processing centers and in connection with our capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation activities compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements including changes relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures 

a decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors further we compete with counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

• the solid waste disposal act including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

• the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances currently characterized by the epa as hazardous many of which are found in common household waste the epa may also designate additional substances as hazardous among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the federal water pollution control act of 1972 the clean water act this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publiclyowned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment

works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities furthermore if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands we may be required to secure permits before such development starts in these situations permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 

• the clean air act the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed the date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill on july 14 2016 the epa issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate rule finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions were part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions see item 1a risk factors – regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate  in this form 10k 

in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past decade the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 passenger automobiles and lightduty trucks collectively lightduty vehicles and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for lightduty vehicles in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for lightduty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal occurred in 2020 but has been challenged in court in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

• the occupational safety and health act of 1970 osha this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste food waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also 

table of contents 

have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public we focus on operating safely and prudently but occasionally we receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not

risks related to our business and operations 

the environmental services industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is typically based on the quality of services ease of doing business andor price competition for disposal business is primarily based on geographic location quality of operations and price one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers changes in refinery operations supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset increased fuel costs resulting from such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 2717 million in 2020 or 27 of revenue compared to 3479 million in 2019 or 34 of revenue 

at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last decade regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for future years these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

part of our fleet of vehicles is powered by cng and we also operate cng fueling stations we have invested higher upfront capital costs in order to purchase and support our cng vehicles and fueling stations in order to reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses and to create a competitive advantage in communities that focus on protecting the environment cng is not yet widely adopted in north america as the cng industry develops new regulations the availability of alternative fuel technologies fluctuations in the price or availability of cng or reductions in tax incentives for the use of cng vehicles could substantially affect our revenue and costs of operations and reduce the benefits sought by investing in cng vehicles and fueling stations 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic 

table of contents 

conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control for instance in 2017 the chinese government imposed strict limits on the import of recyclable materials including by restricting the amount of contaminants allowed in imported recycled paper these limitations significantly decreased the global demand for recyclable materials and resulted in lower commodity prices significant price fluctuations or increased operating costs may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2020 approximately 78 of our recycling processing center volume was fiber based and included occ onp and other mixed paper 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 12 million on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could materially affect our revenue and operating income although we have entered into hedging agreements to help offset volatility in recycled commodity prices in the past we cannot provide assurance that we will enter into these agreements in the future 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection transfer and disposal 

our collection transfer and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of material collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection transfer station and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of material generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the environmental services industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required for our operations because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills or increase acceptable volume at transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage such actions could also create risks related to our reputation which may limit our ability to do business responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste 

table of contents 

facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills some jurisdictions have enacted extended producer responsibility regulations which are designed to make producers fund the postuse life cycle of their products by providing recycling programs for their products or otherwise taking their postuse products back from consumers although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of environmental services including the operation of landfills cng fueling stations a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 24 of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

table of contents 

risks related to our legal and regulatory environment 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of material air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes including those relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the epa has indicated it is considering listing certain pfas as hazardous substances under cercla which if finalized could trigger additional obligations or liabilities under cercla or other laws and regulations 

our business is and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas while passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation appears unlikely in the near term we expect any such legislation if enacted to impose costs on our operations which could be material 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa has taken certain actions administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to lightduty vehicles through model year 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal took place in 2020 but has been challenged in court on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 these standards and further federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions were part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions the trump administration proposed to reconsider these rules but its action has been subject to litigation which is still pending the biden administration has announced that climate change is one of its top priorities if these regulations or an amended version of them eventually goes into effect they may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we cannot predict what other actions or regulations the current administration may undertake that would affect our industry while increased or decreased regulations may affect our operating costs the substantial cost of regulatory compliance reduces the ability of new competitors to enter the industry 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance 

table of contents 

coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by businesses we have acquired environmental laws or regulations may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

risks related to financial strategy and indebtedness 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 9 billion in principal value of debt and finance leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that 

table of contents 

we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other environmental services businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental entities large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy including contractions caused by the covid19 pandemic reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental entities we provide services to a number of these entities including numerous municipalities these governmental entities may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or environmental services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 12 employee benefit plans of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

risks related to our growth strategy 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

• desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified 

• we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified 

• we will effectively integrate and manage companies we acquire or 

• any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 

if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company with undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification by obtaining representations and warranties insurance and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage or that any indemnification or insurance coverage obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

risks related to technology and intellectual property 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of our three differentiating capabilities is to enable our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings further any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws 

emerging technologies including those that are used to recycle and process waste as an alternative to disposal of waste in landfills represent risks as well as opportunities to our current business model the costs associated with developing or investing in emerging technologies could require substantial capital and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows delays in the development or implementation of such emerging technologies and difficulties in marketing new products or services based on emerging technologies could have similar negative impacts our financial results may suffer if we are not able to develop or license emerging technologies or if a competitor obtains exclusive rights to an emerging technology that disrupts the current methods used in the environmental services industry 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use information technology including computer and information networks in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor 

table of contents 

confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information in connection with our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective also the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements this changing regulatory landscape may cause increasingly complex compliance challenges which may increase our compliance costs any failure to comply with these changing security and privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties fines legal challenges and reputational harm the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

other risks relevant to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted and is likely to continue to negatively impact our business results of operations and financial performance 

the covid19 pandemic is having an unprecedented effect on the us economy which has created significant uncertainties these uncertainties include but are not limited to the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy our supply chain partners our employees and our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic our costs of doing business have increased including for the purchase of additional safety equipment and hygiene products increased facility and equipment cleaning meals for our frontline employees the expansion of certain aspects of our existing healthcare programs and the guarantee of a minimum hourly work week to certain frontline employees regardless of service decreases additionally if the pandemic continues and conditions worsen or if there is a large outbreak or resurgence of covid19 in various regions we expect to experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities and our collections of accounts receivable which adverse impacts may be material the degree to which covid19 impacts our results going forward will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of covid19 its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume any of the foregoing factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our business and damage our results of operations and our liquidity position possibly to a significant degree 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects in some of our markets we compete with other similar businesses which may drive labor costs or reduce the amount of available qualified personnel 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

table of contents 

weakened global economic conditions including those resulting from the recent covid19 pandemic may harm our industry business and results of operations 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest ra tes for example the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets a weak economy generally results in decrea ses in volumes which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have certain fixed costs eg facility expense associated with longterm leases depreciation expense and accretion expense which may be difficult to adjust quickly to match declining volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally a decline in volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

general legal proceedings 

we are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements in the normal course of our business we become involved in legal proceedings some may result in fines penalties or judgments against us or settlements which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable we have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately 27 million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of december 31 2020 as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our legal proceedings and where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range if we had used the high ends of such ranges our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 10 million higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2020

recent developments 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus covid19 a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

both national and local government agencies have implemented steps to slow the spread of the virus including shelterinplace orders and the mandatory shutdown of certain businesses during this time we continued to provide essential services to our customers in midmarch 2020 certain customers in our small and largecontainer businesses began adjusting their service levels which included a decrease in the frequency of pickups or a temporary pause in service in addition we experienced a decline in volumes disposed at certain of our landfills and transfer stations as service levels decreased we also experienced a decrease in certain costs of our operations which are variable in nature this decline in service activity peaked in the first half of april and gradually recovered thereafter as local economies began to gradually reopen and customers began to resume service large outbreaks and resurgences of covid19 in various regions may result in a reinstitution of certain restrictions and further adjustments in our service levels which would negatively impact our business

the demand for our environmental solutions business depends on the continued demand for and production of oil and natural gas in certain shale basins located in the united states during the year ended december 31 2020 the price of crude oil and natural gas reached historic lows resulting in a decrease in rig counts and drilling activity that led to a yearoveryear decrease in revenue from our environmental solutions business during the three months ended december 31 2020 we recognized a 426 million charge as a loss on business divestitures and impairments net in our consolidated income statement resulting from management’s decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business as the carrying value of the assets associated with these operations was no longer recoverable we impaired the entire net book value of certain assets comprised mainly of equipment vehicles and containers on at least a quarterly basis we will continue to monitor the effect of the evolving covid19 pandemic on our business and review our estimates for recoverability of assets

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definitions of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies further information on each of these adjustments is included below 

loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs during 2020 we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and other related costs related to the early extinguishment of our 6000 million 5250 senior notes due november 2021 the 2021 notes and our 8500 million 3550 senior notes due june 2022 the 2022 notes and to redeem 2500 million of the 5500 million outstanding 4750 senior notes due may 2023 the 2023 notes we paid total cash premiums of 991 million and incurred noncash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs of 28 million the unamortized proportional share of certain cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings as noncash interest expense was 18 million and the proportional share of our fair value hedges related to the 2023 notes that were dedesignated and recognized in earnings as a reduction to noncash interest expense was 47 million during 2019 we did not incur any losses on the early extinguishment of certain financing arrangements 

restructuring charges in 2019 we incurred costs related to the redesign of certain backoffice software systems which continued into 2020 in addition in july 2020 we eliminated certain backoffice support positions in response to a decline in the underlying demand for services resulting from the covid19 pandemic during 2020 we incurred restructuring charges of 200 million which primarily related to these restructuring efforts during 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 142 million which primarily related to the redesign of certain of our backoffice software systems we paid 155 million and 106 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively related to these restructuring efforts 

in 2021 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 15 million to 20 million primarily related to the redesign of certain of our backoffice software systems substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment 

loss gain on business divestitures and impairments net during 2020 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 777 million which was due to business divestitures and asset impairments in certain markets including 426 million resulting from management’s decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business during 2019 we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 147 million

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds during 2020 we recorded charges to earnings of 345 million for withdrawal events at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute as we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

firedamage related costs during the three months ended december 31 2019 certain of our owned and operated facilities in our group 1 segment were impacted by separate firerelated events although our business may incur firerelated damage to our leased or owned property plant and equipment from time to time we specifically identify in the table above firedamage related costs of 77 million incurred during 2019 due to its magnitude 

bridgeton insurance recovery during 2020 and 2019 we recognized insurance recoveries of 108 million and 240 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri which we recognized as a reduction of remediation expenses in our cost of operations 

incremental contract startup costs  large municipal contract although our business regularly incurs startup costs under municipal contracts we specifically identify in the table above the startup costs with respect to an individual municipal contract and do not adjust for other startup costs under other contracts in 2020 or 2019 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs involved with this particular municipal contract and the unusual nature for the time period in which they were incurred during 2019 we incurred costs of 07 million related to the implementation of this large municipal contract these costs did not meet the capitalization criteria prescribed by accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 and other assets and deferred costscontracts with customers subtopic 34040  

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers including the collection and processing of recyclable materials collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and other environmental solutions our residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties our recycling processing centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from environmental solutions consists mainly of fees we charge for disposal of nonhazardous solid and liquid material and inplant services such as transportation and logistics environmental solutions waste is generated from the byproduct of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity additionally it is generated by the daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities including maintenance plant turnarounds and capital projects other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

table of contents 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 28 and 29 for 2020 and 2019 respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 50 for both 2020 and 2019 

during 2020 we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2019 

• average yield increased revenue by 26 due to positive pricing changes in all lines of business 

• the fuel recovery fee program which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices decreased revenue by 07 primarily due to a decrease in fuel prices compared to the same period in 2019 and a decrease in the total revenue subject to the fuel recovery fees 

• volume decreased revenue by 31 primarily due to a reduction in service levels attributable to the covid19 

table of contents 

pandemic we experienced volume declines in our small and largecontainer lines of business as a result of a reduction in the frequency of pickups or a temporary pause in service for certain of our customers in addition we experienced declines in special waste volumes disposed at certain of our landfills and a decrease in volumes at our transfer stations these decreases were partially offset by an increase in construction and demolition volumes in our landfill line of business along with one additional workday as compared to 2019 

• recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 03 primarily due to an increase in overall commodity prices as compared to 2019 the average price for recycled commodities excluding glass and organics for 2020 was 96 per ton compared to 77 per ton for 2019 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately 12 million 

• environmental solutions revenue decreased by 09 primarily due to a decrease in rig counts drilling activity and the delay of inplant project work as a result of lower demand for crude oil 

• acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 04 due to our continued growth strategy of acquiring privately held environmental services companies that complement our existing business platform this was partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the divestiture of certain nonstrategic assets during the year 

cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our material to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide environmental services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management costs which include insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



1 during the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we incurred an additional 01 million of firedamage related costs which are reflected in other selling general and administrative expense 

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by component to that of other companies and of ours for prior periods 

table of contents 

our cost of operations decreased for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of the following 

• labor and related benefits decreased due to a decline in service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases and one additional workday during 2020 as compared to 2019 

• transfer and disposal costs decreased as a result of lower collection volumes partially offset by an increase in third party disposal rates during both 2020 and 2019 approximately 68 of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 

• maintenance and repairs expense decreased due to a decrease in service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

• transportation and subcontract costs decreased slightly primarily due to a decline in demand for our environmental solutions business as well as a decrease in transfer station volumes partially offset by increases due to acquisitionrelated activity along with one additional workday during 2020 as compared to 2019 

• fuel costs decreased due to a decline in fuel prices and service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic the national average cost per gallon for diesel fuel in 2020 was 255 compared to 306 for 2019 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 25 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million per year 

• disposal fees and taxes decreased due to a decrease in service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

• landfill operating expenses increased due to the recognition of certain favorable remediation adjustments in 2019 that did not recur in 2020 

• risk management expenses decreased primarily due to favorable actuarial development in our auto liability and workers compensation prior year programs coupled with a decline in exposure in our current year program 

• other costs of operations increased during 2020 as a result of incremental costs incurred related to the covid19 pandemic including costs for additional safety equipment and hygiene products increased facility and equipment cleaning and costs associated with our committed to serve initiative partially offset by a decline in necessary facility repairs as well as decreased third party equipment rentals as a result of a decline in service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

• during 2019 we incurred 76 million of firerelated damage costs in our cost of operations that resulted from damage to our leased or owned property plant and equipment in our group 1 segment 

• during 2020 and 2019 we recognized favorable insurance recoveries of 108 million and 240 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill as a reduction of remediation expenses in our consolidated statement of income for the applicable period 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions 

landfill depletion and amortization decreased in aggregate dollars due to lower landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by decreased special waste volumes partially offset by an increase in our overall average depletion rate 

amortization of other intangible assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were 212 million and 204 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively or 02 of revenue for both 2020 and 2019 our other intangible assets primarily relate to 

table of contents 

customer relationships and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization expense increased due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions 

amortization of other assets 

expenses for amortization of other assets were 388 million or 04 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 343 million or 03 of revenue for 2019 our other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloudbased hosting arrangements 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 829 million and 819 million or 08 of revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties legal settlements marketing investor and community relations services directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges restructuring charges are excluded from selling general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately 

the following table summarizes our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies and of ours for prior periods 

the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative expenses during 2020 as compared to 2019 are summarized below 

• in 2020 salaries and related benefits decreased in aggregate dollars primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense related to our performance shares and continued efficiencies at our customer resource centers attributable to our investments in enhanced technology platforms this decrease was partially offset by higher wages benefits and other payroll related items resulting from annual merit increases 

• provision for doubtful accounts decreased in aggregate dollars during 2020 primarily due to improved collections during the period as demonstrated by the reduction in our days sales outstanding to 386 or 264 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2020 compared to 398 or 279 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2019 

• other selling general and administrative expenses decreased during 2020 primarily due to a decrease in travel and advertising costs as a result of the covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by an increase in facility and equipment cleaning expenses attributable to the covid19 pandemic professional fees certain charitable donations associated with our committed to serve initiative and acquisition deal costs 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds 

during 2020 we recorded charges to earnings of 345 million for withdrawal events at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute we paid 344 million during 2020 relative to these withdrawal events as we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

loss gain on business divestitures and impairments net 

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we 

table of contents 

will achieve a leading market position over time where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets business divestitures could result in gains losses or impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

during 2020 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 777 million which was due to business divestitures and asset impairments in certain markets including 426 million resulting from managements decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business during 2019 we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 147 million 

restructuring charges 

in 2019 we incurred costs related to the redesign of certain backoffice software systems which continued into 2020 in addition in july 2020 we eliminated certain backoffice support positions in response to a decline in the underlying demand for services resulting from the covid19 pandemic during 2020 we incurred restructuring charges of 200 million which primarily related to these restructuring efforts during 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 142 million which primarily related to the redesign of certain of our backoffice software systems we paid 155 million and 106 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively related to these restructuring efforts 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 



total interest expense for 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating and fixed rate debt the decrease attributable to our fixed rate debt is primarily due to the issuance of 3500 million of 0875 senior notes and 7500 million of 1750 senior notes in november 2020 6500 million of 1450 senior notes in august 2020 6000 million of 2300 senior notes and 4000 million of 3050 senior notes in february 2020 as well as the issuance of 9000 million of 2500 senior notes in august 2019 the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding senior notes with coupons ranging from 3550 to 5500 

during 2020 and 2019 cash paid for interest excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps was 3251 million and 3468 million respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during 2020 we incurred a 1019 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt  we paid total cash premiums during the year totaling 991 million and incurred noncash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs of 28 million 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 1731 million and 2220 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively our effective income tax rate was 152 and 171 for 2020 and 2019 respectively we made income tax payments net of refunds of approximately 124 million and 31 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively income taxes paid in 2020 and 2019 reflect benefits from 100 bonus depreciation on qualified assets as well as tax credits from our continuing investments in solar energy 

during 2020 we acquired noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investments in loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting see note 3 business acquisitions investments and restructuring charges  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our 2020 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately 100 million due to the tax credits related to these investments in addition our 2020 tax provision was reduced by 172 million for adjustments to our valuation allowance due to the realizability of certain state loss carryforwards lastly our provision was further reduced by 82 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits as well as 

table of contents 

adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2019 tax returns and 116 million from excess tax benefits related to stock compensation 

our 2019 tax provision was reduced by 123 million from excess tax benefits related to stock compensation approximately 84 million related to the tax credits from our noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets and approximately 13 million due to the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates following the completion of our 2018 tax returns 

during the three months ended december 31 2020 we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our deferred tax assets related to certain state loss carryforwards most of these loss carryforwards are attributable to a specific subsidiary for which we have historically provided a partial valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of these carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where the loss carryforwards exist the realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods as a result of recent changes in us tax law the current macroeconomic environment and our ongoing efforts to streamline and maximize the efficiency of our tax footprint we completed our restructuring plan which optimized our tax structure to better align with our overall operational footprint this resulted in a reduction to our valuation allowance of 172 million for the year and three months ended december 31 2020 

we have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 99 million available as of december 31 2020 these state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2021 and 2040 we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states in recognition of this risk as of december 31 2020 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 44 million 

reportable segments 

in december 2020 our senior management began evaluating overseeing and managing the financial performance of our operations through three operating segments group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states our environmental solutions operating segment which provides waste management solutions for daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities is aggregated with corporate entities and other as it only represents approximately 1 of our consolidated revenue each of our reportable segments provides integrated environmental services including collection transfer recycling and disposal services 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 



financial information for the year ended december 31 2019 reflects the transfer of our environmental solutions operating segment from group 2 to corporate entities and other corporate entities and other include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills environmental solutions and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local 

table of contents 

operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2020 compared to 2019 are discussed below 

group 1 

revenue for 2020 increased 11 from 2019 primarily due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and one additional workday during 2020 this increase was partially offset by volume declines in our small and largecontainer collection transfer station and landfill lines of business 

operating income for group 1 increased from 12317 million for 2019 or a 246 operating margin to 13433 million for 2020 or a 266 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

• cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2020 primarily due to a decrease in labor and related benefits maintenance and repairs expenses disposal fees and taxes and fuel costs as a result of decreased service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic fuel costs further decreased due to cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and recognized during 2020 

• landfill depletion and amortization favorably impacted operating income margin during 2020 primarily due to lower landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by decreased special waste volumes and by favorable amortization adjustments to our asset retirement obligations during 2020 compared to the adjustments recognized in 2019 depreciation unfavorably impacted operating margin primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions 

group 2 

revenue for 2020 decreased 31 from 2019 due to volume declines in our collection lines of business as well as a decrease in special waste volumes in our landfill line of business these decreases were partially offset by an increase in average yield in all lines of business increases in construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes in our landfill line of business and one additional workday during 2020 

operating income for group 2 increased from 9265 million for 2019 or an 187 operating margin to 9664 million for 2020 or a 202 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

• cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2020 primarily due to a decrease in labor and related benefits transfer and disposal costs maintenance and repairs expenses and fuel costs as a result of decreased service levels attributable to the covid19 pandemic fuel costs further decreased due to cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and recognized during 2020 

• landfill depletion and amortization unfavorably impacted operating income margin during 2020 primarily due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate and by decreased favorable amortization adjustments to our asset retirement obligations during 2020 compared to the adjustments recognized in 2019 depreciation unfavorably impacted operating income margin primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions 

corporate entities and other 

operating loss in our corporate entities and other segment increased from 3710 million for 2019 to 6006 million for 2020 during 2020 we recorded a net loss on business divestitures and impairments of 777 million which was due to business divestitures and asset impairments in certain markets including 426 million resulting from management’s decision to exit certain product offerings and geographic basins in our upstream environmental solutions business during 2019 we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of 147 million additionally we recognized an insurance recovery of 108 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2020 as compared to an insurance recovery of 240 million recognized in the same period in 2019 during 2020 we recognized certain direct and incremental costs attributable to the covid19 pandemic including costs for additional safety equipment and hygiene products increased facility and equipment cleaning and costs associated with our committed to serve initiative 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment transportation and disposal costs methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to

depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

available airspace 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we owned or operated 186 and 189 active solid waste landfills respectively with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 50 billion inplace cubic yards for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity as measured in cubic yards of airspace 





total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 11 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these 11 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 123 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 63 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2020 



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2020 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 13464 million of which 575 million were current and 12889 million were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

during 2020 and 2019 we recognized insurance recoveries of 108 million and 240 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

for a description of our significant remediation matters see note 8 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

investment in landfills 

as of december 31 2020 we expect to spend an estimated additional 95 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 136 billion or 272 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw on our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

summary of cash flow activity 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2020 and 2019 are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2020 and 2019 are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 1299 million in 2020 compared to a decrease of 2134 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the following 

• our accounts receivable exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits decreased 138 million during 2020 compared to a 383 million increase in 2019 as of december 31 2020 our days sales outstanding were 386 or 264 days net of deferred revenue compared to 398 or 279 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2019 

• our prepaid expenses and other assets decreased 65 million in 2020 compared to an increase of 1097 million in 2019 primarily due to the receipt of the bridgeton landfill settlement in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in alternative fuel tax credit receipts during 2020 compared to 2019 partially offset by an increase of prepaid taxes due to the timing of our estimated tax payments 

• our accounts payable decreased 467 million during 2020 compared to an increase of 64 million during 2019 due to the timing of payments 

• cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations was 196 million lower during 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and postclosure payments at certain of our landfill sites 

• cash paid for remediation obligations was 144 million higher during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to 256 million in payments related to management and monitoring of the remediation area of our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri during 2020 as compared to 166 million of payments during 2019 

in addition cash paid for interest was 3251 million and 3468 million excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps for 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2020 and 2019 are summarized below 

• capital expenditures during 2020 were 11946 million as compared to 12071 million for 2019 

table of contents 

• proceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2020 were 301 million as compared to 217 million for 2019 

• during 2020 and 2019 we used 7695 million and 5751 million respectively for acquisitions and investments net of cash acquired during 2020 and 2019 we received 329 million and 428 million for business divestitures respectively 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to pay for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2020 and 2019 are summarized below 

• during 2020 we issued 27500 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 27161 million during 2019 we issued 9000 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 8911 million net payments of notes payable and longterm debt were 25959 million during 2020 compared to net payments of 5814 million in 2019 for a more detailed discussion see the financial condition section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• during 2020 we paid 991 million in cash premiums on the redemption of senior notes 

• during 2020 we repurchased 12 million shares of our stock for 988 million during 2019 we repurchased 49 million shares of our stock for 3994 million 

• in july 2020 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to 0425 per share dividends paid were 5225 million and 4912 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively 

• during 2020 and 2019 cash paid for purchase price holdback releases and contingent purchase price related to acquisitions was 155 million and 172 million respectively 

in september 2020 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of one of our landfill finance leases by 43 years or through the end of the landfills site life accordingly we recognized an incremental finance lease obligation of 904 million 

financial condition 

debt obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 1681 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months which includes certain variable rate taxexempt financings finance lease obligations and debentures all of our taxexempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we currently have availability under our 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 

an extended period of economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic could further disrupt the global supply chain negatively impact demand for our services and disrupt financial markets these effects could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition including our access to sources of liquidity we will continue to monitor the evolving covid19 pandemic along with the effect on our business and access to capital markets refer to part i item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risk factors related to this pandemic 

for further discussion of the components of our overall debt see note 9 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

credit facilities 

the 364day credit facility 

in august 2020 we entered into a 10 billion 364day unsecured revolving credit facility the 364day credit facility which matures in august 2021 at our option borrowings under the 364day credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the 364day credit facility agreement 

the 364day credit facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the 364day credit facility agreement and the aggregate commitment regardless of usage availability under our 364day credit facility totaled 10 billion as of december 31 2020 the 364day credit facility can be used for working capital capital expenditures 

table of contents 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes the 364day credit facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants which are consistent with the financial and other covenants included in our credit facility we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 

as of december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under our 364day credit facility 

the credit facility 

in 2018 we entered into a 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as amended the credit facility  which matures in june 2023 as permitted by the credit facility we have the right to request two oneyear extensions of the maturity date but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension the credit facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 10 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the credit facility agreement 

the credit facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the credit facility agreement and the aggregate commitment regardless of usage availability under our credit facility totaled 16718 million and 16969 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the credit facility can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes the credit facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 1860 million and 1844 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility respectively we had 3765 million and 3514 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

in july 2020 we executed an amendment to the credit facility agreement to increase flexibility and reduce restrictions in particu lar for future acquisitions effective june 30 2020  the amendment eliminated the consolidated interest coverage ratio and revised the sole remaining financial covenant total debt to ebitda ratio 

uncommitted credit facility 

we also have an uncommitted credit facility which bears interest at a libor rate or a cost of funds rate both as defined in the uncommitted credit facility agreement plus an applicable margin we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreement governing our uncommitted credit facility requires us to comply with certain covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under our uncommitted credit facility as of december 31 2019 we had 116 million of borrowings outstanding under our uncommitted credit facility 

financial and other covenants 

the credit facility and 364day credit facility collectively the credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity in july 2020 we executed an amendment to the credit facility agreement to increase flexibility and reduce restrictions in particu lar for future acquisitions effective june 30 2020  the amendment eliminated the consolidated interest coverage ratio and revised the sole remaining financial covenant total debt to ebitda ratio the 364day credit facility and the credit facility as amended provide that our total debt to ebitda ratio may not exceed 375 to 100 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter in the case of an elevated ratio period which may be elected by us if one or more acquisitions during a fiscal quarter involve aggregate consideration in excess of 2000 million the trigger quarter the total debt to ebitda ratio may not exceed 425 to 100 during the trigger quarter and for the three fiscal quarters thereafter the 364day credit facility and the credit facility as amended also provide that there may not be more than two elevated ratio periods during the respective terms of the credit facility and 364day credit facility agreements as of december 31 2020 our total debt to ebitda ratio was 307 compared to the 375 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2021 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility and 364day credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and wou ld allow the lenders under the credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit facilities agreements this could have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on the credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt 

table of contents 

instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facilities for relief from the financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated 

senior notes and debentures 

as of december 31 2020 we had 74370 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2050 as of december 31 2019 we had 72570 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2041 

in november 2020 we issued 3500 million of 0875 senior notes due 2025 the 0875 notes and 7500 million of 1750 senior notes due 2032 the 1750 notes we used the net proceeds from the 0875 notes and 1750 notes to redeem all 8500 million of the outstanding 3550 senior notes due june 2022 and 2500 million of the 5500 million outstanding 4750 senior notes due may 2023 

in august 2020 we issued 6500 million of 1450 senior notes due 2031 the 1450 notes we used the net proceeds to redeem all 6000 million of the outstanding 5250 senior notes due november 2021 plus a makewhole premium of 340 million the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

in february 2020 we issued 6000 million of 2300 senior notes due 2030 the 2300 notes and 4000 million of 3050 senior notes due 2050 the 3050 notes we used the net proceeds from the 2300 notes and 3050 notes to repay 8500 million of 5000 senior notes that matured in march 2020 the remaining proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facilities as well as for general corporate purposes 

our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations interest is payable semiannually 

derivative instruments and hedging relationships 

our ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy historically we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt from time to time we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate fair value hedges or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances cash flow hedges 

additionally we amended certain interest rate lock agreements extending the mandatory maturity date and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges the extended interest rate locks in addition we entered into offsetting interest rate swaps to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the extended interest rate locks 

for a description of our derivative contracts and hedge accounting see note 9 debt  to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2020 we had 11047 million of certain variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2050 as of december 31 2019 we had 11162 million of certain variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2049 during the year ended december 31 2020 we issued 600 million of new taxexempt financings during the year ended december 31 2019 we refinanced 350 million and issued 300 million of taxexempt financings 

finance leases 

we had finance lease liabilities of 2065 million and 1193 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2063 and 2020 to 2049 respectively 

in september 2020 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of one of our landfill finance leases by 43 years or through the end of the landfills site life accordingly we recognized an incremental finance lease obligation of 904 million 

table of contents 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2020 for variable rate debt the effect of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2020 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2020 and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2021 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than shortterm operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

contingencies

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

• landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 

• landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping closure and postclosure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

landfill development costs 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 

• studies performed could be inaccurate which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 

• actions by neighboring parties private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain maintain or expand permits could result in denial revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit improved technical information as a project progresses or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment 

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 

• technical design requirements as approved may need modifications at some future point in time 

table of contents 

• technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

• estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 

• the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions including waste compaction practices site design climate and the nature of the waste 

• capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in yearoveryear cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

• actual future costs of construction materials and thirdparty labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions regulatory changes or legislative changes 

landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

• changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

table of contents 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 17 in 2020 and 2019 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 34 and 43 in 2020 and 2019 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping closure activities or postclosure monitoring activities types and quantities of materials used or term of postclosure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 

• changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 

• actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping closure and postclosure liabilities 

• changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 

• changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the creditadjusted riskfree rate used to discount the liabilities which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities assets and expense 

• amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design postclosure monitoring requirements or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents 

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

• we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement 

• we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources 

• there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project including political impediments 

• progress is being made on the project 

• the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame and 

• we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit 

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

• we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure accruals an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in certain business combinations environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in certain business combinations are initially estimated on a discounted basis and accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and 

table of contents 

settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

• we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events thus our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified the financial viability of those parties and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any adjustments could be material 

• actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 

• an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of income 

insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million to 10 million the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 

residual risks 

• incident rates including frequency and severity and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change which would be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 

• recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims adjustments if any to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

• the settlement costs to discharge our obligations including legal and health care costs could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our insurance reserves to change

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 

table of contents 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forwardlooking statement 



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 1204 million 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2020 contemporaneously with our 2500 million redemption of the 4750 notes we dedesignated the proportional share of these swap agreements as fair value hedges our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

we have historically entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes upon the expected issuance of senior notes we terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges all of our cash flow hedges settled on or before december 31 2020 thus there is no related asset or liability as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2019 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 5750 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1330 to 3000 

as of december 31 2020 we had 12972 million of floating rate debt and 3000 million of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 16 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk as of december 31 2020 we had no fuel hedges in place while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 25 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 2717 million in 2020 or 27 of revenue compared to 3479 million in 2019 or 34 of revenue 

commodities price risk 

we market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling processing centers changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices in prior periods we have entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our 

table of contents 

exposure to changes in prices of these commodities as of december 31 2020 we had no recycling commodity hedges in place 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately 12 million 

revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 2971 million and 2733 million respectively

 item 1 business 

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and environmental services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2019 we operated facilities in 41 states and puerto rico through 340 collection operations 212 transfer stations 189 active landfills 79 recycling processing centers 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 15 salt water disposal wells and 4 deep injection wells we are engaged in 75 landfill gastoenergy and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 130 closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

the five pillars of our strategy  profitable growth through differentiation 

we believe that our products and services are valuable and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase customer loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation is built on five key pillars including 1 market position 2 operating model 3 people and talent agenda 4 customer zeal and 5 digital platform 

market position 

the goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 

• volume growth  we believe waste volumes are driven by population growth household formation and new business formation volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste and recyclable materials under residential collection contracts with municipalities exclusive franchise agreements and smallcontainer and largecontainer contracts we also look to enter into longterm disposal and recycling processing contracts with municipalities and other third parties by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at a rate consistent with the underlying economic growth in these markets in addition by securing longterm agreements we are better able to help ensure we earn an appropriate return on the capital deployed 

• price increases  we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in vehicles equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling processing centers 

• expansion of recycling capabilities  based on the most recent us environmental protection agency epa data we believe approximately 35 of municipal solid waste is recycled and we expect that percentage to increase over the longterm while there are examples of communities cancelling their recycling programs many more have committed to enhance and expand their recycling programs for their residents we continue to focus on innovative material handling processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an appropriate return we will continue to look for 

opportunities to expand or enhance our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services and demonstrating a willingness to pay and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

• infrastructure development  we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as a vertically integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated our goal is to create marketspecific vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations landfills and recycling processing centers where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling processing centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites additionally we seek opportunities to expand and permit new airspace at our existing landfills in order to replace airspace consumed development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

external growth 

• acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships  our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privatelyheld companies including increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and technology and the limited number of exit strategies for privatelyheld companies we also evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publiclyowned waste companies 

we continue to invest in valueenhancing acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 200 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe over time we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they seek to raise capital andor reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent highquality service to all of our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business 

organizational structure 

a key enabler of the republic way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

through this operating model we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way 

fleet automation 

approximately 76 of our residential routes have been converted to automated singledriver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng 

approximately 20 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is the most prudent approach to realizing the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 13 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2019 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2019 we operated 39 cng fueling stations 

we are also monitoring and influencing a number of alternative fuel technologies such as electrification to improve the total cost of ownership of our fleet and reduce our environmental impact through lower fleet emissions 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2019 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs additionally our focus on preventative maintenance is improving the reliability of our fleet and enabling us to provide superior service to our customers differentiating us from our competition the entire fleet was certified under onefleet by the second quarter of 2017 

people and talent agenda 

the goal of our people and talent agenda pillar is to create an environment to attract and retain the best talent our people continue to be the most critical component in successfully executing our strategy we strive to make republic a desirable place to work for our approximately 36000 fulltime employees by creating learning experiences and programs that develop train engage and motivate as well as compensation and benefits that attract and retain the best workforce with a focus on safety employee engagement learning and talent development and inclusion and diversity we aspire to be a company where the best people want to work and are engaged every day 

safety 

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve we have a dedicated team of safety professionals at our corporate headquarters and in our field operations the leader of which reports directly to our chief operating officer due to the nature of our industry we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 10 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 39 better than the industry average our think choose live slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think about what you are doing choose the safe answer and live to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition in which they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

through our safety amplified program we are providing even more tools and driving even greater awareness to help our teams better execute our safety standards continual training multifaceted programs and strategic partnerships are key components of our platform it’s simple by design and comprised of actions and activities that ensure safety is embedded in all we do the program includes six initiatives to help us achieve our goal to have zero employee fatalities and reduce our osha total recordable incident rate 

• focus together this is our core safety program created for our frontline employees and designed to help eliminate six types of serious incidents we recently extended the scope and reach of the program to include all employees across the company 

• lead together this focus area brings bestinclass communication channels to our employees and includes advanced training techniques for all supervisors and managers 

• partner together were initiating more frequent and higher quality leadership visits and interaction with frontline employees these visits are designed to pull together leaders from a variety of departments to support the divisions safety goals 

• celebrate together we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award the national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year republic drivers have won 70 of the driver of the year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009 in addition our best drivers are recognized and rewarded with competing in our national roadeo competition 

• analyze together we analyze realtime data to make short and longterm decisions and identify opportunities for improvement examples include analysis of roadway awareness training data mapping and other employee protection and preparedness insights with these analytics we will be able to make proactive safety decisions to generate better results 

• innovate together we leverage the latest technologies including automation and take a datadriven approach to support our employees these innovations include rear cameras incab backing alarm systems and event recording systems throughout our fleet we’re also working with equipment manufacturers to incorporate safety elements such as seat belt alarms blind spot awareness lane departure alarms and other potentially lifesaving equipment in our fleet 

we believe our safety amplified program will deliver additional positive impacts for our company and stakeholders including 

1 further strengthen relationships within the communities we service 

2 enhance customer trust 

3 streamline operational processes and increase productivity 

4 deliver a reputational advantage including positioning our company as an employerofchoice 

5 build and sustain a safety culture in all areas of our business 

6 contribute to employee engagement 

employee engagement 

we believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success we have found that business units with a highly engaged workforce experience approximately 59 less turnover additionally we know that engaged employees deliver better customer service and are more productive and safe drivers we measure employee engagement annually through a third party survey and compensate our general managers on their employee engagement scores we improved our employee engagement score from 85 in 2018 to 86 in 2019 and continued to outperform industry benchmarks 

learning and talent development 

we are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers targeted onboarding experiences including our driver training center sales acceleration general manager and operations onboarding programs focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role our leadership trainee program an 18month rotational experience for recent college graduates is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth 

developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda from our leadership fundamentals program a program for all leaders of people to our leadership trainee and general manager acceleration programs for early career leaders we have developed programs and experiences to help ensure that as our leaders progress they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level 

our leadership fundamentals program was awarded the 2018 brandon hall group excellence award for best advance in leadership development our leadership trainee program has enabled us to place new leaders in key positions in the field and at our phoenix headquarters the general manager acceleration program is designed to enable its participants to become the next generation of general managers with a deep knowledge of the business and the skills necessary to build and lead successful teams ongoing support for leaders is provided by way of a biweekly leadership videocast that reinforces the concepts from our leadership trainings challenges employees to continue to apply the key learnings and offers ongoing tools for addressing the more seasonal aspects of leading throughout the year over the last five years more than 5200 leaders have completed our leadership fundamentals program creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees 

our leadership programs are the driving force behind our talent engine and are critical to our business strategy we are developing leaders that are strategically minded and foster an inclusive culture 

inclusion and diversity 

we strive to create an inclusive and diverse culture where all employees can thrive and feel welcomed and valued our mission of supporting an inclusive culture mosaic is driven by our office of inclusion and diversity and supported by the mosaic council our approach enables us to continue to develop new strategies and activities to create a more inclusive work environment and diverse workforce through these efforts we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers in 2017 the mosaic council launched the women of republic business resource group which was developed to provide a platform to empower members and enrich a diverse culture that values develops and advances women in leadership advancing women in leadership roles will provide greater diversity of thought and perspective which has been proven to drive better decision making 

in 2019 we launched our veterans advocacy learning outreach and recruiting valor business resource group which is focused on creating an inclusive culture that attracts retains develops and values veterans and their families throughout the organization and in our communities we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2019 approximately 2500 veterans served in a variety of roles ranging from drivers to senior leaders 

in 2020 and beyond we expect to launch additional business resource groups 

customer zeal 

the goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs we believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service 

to help our sales team identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering we use a priority based selling pbs technique and our capture pricing tool nationwide 

• pbs enables us to identify and segment customers’ buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings 

• capture is a cloudbased pricing tool that creates a more professional sales experience helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale and provides enhanced controls over the price quoting process 

in response to our customers’ requests we expanded our suite of products to include electronics recycling with blueguard ®  universal recycling and allinone office ®  for those services that we don’t provide we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship 

to help ensure a consistent customer experience we invested in our customer service capabilities and consolidated over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers these stateoftheart facilities and the technology deployed provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service though a variety of communication channels the stateoftheart centers enhance the customer experience and provide us a platform to reduce the cost to service our customers

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

at republic we believe in the preservation of our blue planet ®  to support a cleaner safer and healthier world we’re passionate about our role as responsible stewards of our nation’s waste in 2014 we identified five sustainability elements that remain deeply engrained within our business safety people operations materials management and communities these elements continue to guide our short and longterm sustainability and business goals 

it was at this time that we also launched our sustainability platform and original sustainability goals we achieved the three timebound sustainability goals set in 2014 which included developing two landfill gastoenergy projects per year by 2018 adding an additional 150000 tons or more per year of recycling capability by 2018 and reducing absolute fleet emissions by 3 from our direct operational impacts by 2018 

as we grow so does our opportunity to make a meaningful positive impact on the environment and society over the past year the company undertook a comprehensive approach to the development of additional sustainability goals that build on these past achievements this included an analysis of global trends identification of our business model dependencies and engagement with key stakeholders 

in 2019 we unveiled additional longterm goals that are ambitious by design and address critical global macrotrends as well as our greatest opportunities to create value at scale each of them is aligned with one of the company’s five sustainability elements and together they are designed to significantly benefit the environment and society while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business for the longterm

republic is the first us recycling and solid waste services provider to have its emissions reduction target approved by the science based targets initiative 2  we also aligned our new sustainability goals with the united nations general assembly’s sustainable development goals these include the following united nations initiatives 8 growth 11 sustainable cities and communities 12 responsible consumption and production and 13 climate action 

in addition to setting new goals in 2019 we increased our level of sustainability disclosure and transparency 

our board of directors’ sustainability and corporate responsibility committee was created in 2015 this committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance our corporate responsibilities our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risks including cyber security environmental and climate related risks and opportunities and reputational risks the entire board conducts a formal comprehensive review of the company’s performance in these areas on an annual basis

cash utilization strategy 

we take a consistent and balanced approach to capital allocation to drive longterm sustainable value for our shareholders the predictability of our free cash flows allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy which includes investing in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa2 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2019 such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2019 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 0405 per share which represents an increase of approximately 8 over the prior year over the last five years our dividends have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 77 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2017 our board of directors added 20 billion to the existing share repurchase authorization that now extends through december 31 2020 as of december 31 2019 there was 07 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock and the parameters around which we repurchase our shares 

shareholder value 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management we have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters including governance executive compensation environmental and social matters 

management team 

we believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets will contribute to what we call our composite strength composite strength combines the vast varied experience and capability of both strong wasteindustry veterans and talented people from other industries additionally composite strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry  many of them from blue chip companies

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste and recycling companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we have a strong national verticallyintegrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate where appropriate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 68 of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific verticallyintegrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling processing centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste recovering and recycling of certain materials and environmental services 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer and largecontainer solid waste collection services through 340 collection operations in 2019 approximately 75 of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 22 of our total revenue related to residential services approximately 31 related to smallcontainer services and approximately 22 related to largecontainer services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling processing centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure through competitive bids which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer business we supply our customers with waste and recycling containers of varying sizes we typically perform smallcontainer collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal our smallcontainer services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with waste and recycling containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer collection business the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

transfer services 

we own or operate 212 transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 6 of our revenue during 2019 our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling processing centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill or processing center in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills or processing centers rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 189 active landfills our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue during 2019 as of december 31 2019 we had 38494 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2019 we operated 75 landfill gas and renewable energy projects the majority of these projects were developed and are owned by a third party 

we also have responsibility for 130 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 79 recycling processing centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 3 of our revenue during 2019 approximately 79 of our total recycling processing center volume is fiber based and includes occ onp and other mixed paper during 2019 we processed and sold 22 million tons excluding glass and organics from our recycling processing centers an additional 22 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 13 million and 13 million respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or largecontainer customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty processing facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example robotics and advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

environmental services 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 15 salt water disposal wells and 4 deep injection wells environmental services waste is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity additionally it is generated by the daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities including maintenance plant turnarounds and capital projects we provide these customers with environmentally responsible solutions to manage their waste needs including disposal of nonhazardous solid and liquid waste and inplant services such as transportation and logistics in 2019 approximately 2 of our revenue was derived from environmental services 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering quality of service and price from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations recycling facilities certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

• the solid waste disposal act including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra rcra establishes a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

• the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site 

and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances characterized by the epa as hazardous many of which are found in common household waste among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the federal water pollution control act of 1972 the clean water act this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under the clean water act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publiclyowned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities furthermore if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands we may be required to secure permits before such development starts in these situations permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 

• the clean air act   the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed the date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill on july 14 2016 the epa issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate rule finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions were part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions see item 1a risk factors – regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate  in this form 10k 

in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past several years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel 

economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 passenger automobiles and lightduty trucks collectively lightduty vehicles and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for lightduty vehicles in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for lightduty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal is anticipated in 2020 but may be challenged in court in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

• the occupational safety and health act of 1970 osha this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste food waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste 

across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public we focus on operating safely and prudently but occasionally we receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally a decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental entities large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental entities we provide services to a number of these entities including numerous municipalities these governmental entities may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or environmental services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is typically based on the quality of services ease of doing business andor price competition for disposal business is primarily based on geographic location quality of operations and price one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers changes in refinery operations supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset increased fuel costs resulting from such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3479 million in 2019 or 34 of revenue compared to 3914 million in 2018 or 39 of revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2018 approximately 6 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements fuel hedges all of our fuel hedges settled on or before december 31 2018 and we did not enter into any new agreements in 2019 additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for future years these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control for instance in 2017 the chinese government imposed strict limits on the import of recyclable materials including by restricting the amount of contaminants allowed in imported recycled paper these limitations significantly decreased the global demand for recyclable materials and resulted in lower commodity prices significant price fluctuations or increased operating costs may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in 2019 approximately 79 of our recycling processing center volume was fiber based and included occ onp and other mixed paper 

historically to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2017 we entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted occ sales all of which expired in 2018 we have not entered into any agreements related to forecasted occ sales since 2017 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 13 million and 13 million respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could materially affect our revenue and operating income although we have entered into hedging agreements to help offset volatility in recycled commodity prices in the past we cannot provide assurance that we will enter into these agreements in the future 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection transfer station and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required for our operations because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills or increase acceptable volume at transfer stations have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage such actions could also create risks related to our reputation which may limit our ability to do business responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing 

landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of waste collection transfer disposal recycling and environmental services including the operation of landfills cng fueling stations a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes including those relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our business is and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to lightduty vehicles through model year 2025 in 2018 the epa and the nhtsa proposed to revise the lightduty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent final action on the proposal is anticipated in 2020 but may be challenged in court on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions are part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions the trump administration proposed to reconsider these rules but its action has been subject to litigation which is still pending if these regulations or an amended version of them eventually goes into effect they may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by businesses we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 88 billion in principal value of debt and finance leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

• desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified 

• we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified 

• we will effectively integrate and manage companies we acquire or 

• any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 

if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company with undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification by obtaining representations and warranties insurance and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage or that any indemnification or insurance coverage obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 24 of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 12 employee benefit plans of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of the five pillars of our strategy is to grow through enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings further any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws in addition emerging technologies that are used to recycle and process waste as an alternative to disposal of waste in landfills represent risks as well as opportunities to our current business model 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use information technology including computer and information networks in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information in connection with our strategy to grow through 

acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and environmental services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2019 we operated facilities in 41 states and puerto rico through 340 collection operations 212 transfer stations 189 active landfills 79 recycling processing centers 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities 15 salt water disposal wells and 4 deep injection wells we are engaged in 75 landfill gastoenergy and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 130 closed landfills 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 26 to 102994 million compared to 100409 million for the same period in 2018 this change in revenue is due to increases in total price including fuel recovery fees of 28 and acquisitions net of divestitures of 08 partially offset by the impact of decreased volumes of 04 environmental services of 03 and recycling processing and commodity sales of 03 

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 12958 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 13209 million in 2018 our net income attributable to republic services inc was 10733 million or 333 per diluted share for 2019 compared to 10369 million or 316 per diluted share for 2018 

during 2019 and 2018 we recorded a number of charges other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our cost of operations  selling general and administrative expenses and income taxes discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 



1 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2019 

2 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2018 

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definitions of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies further information on each of these adjustments is included below 

restructuring charges in january 2018 we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select backoffice functions including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations during 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 142 million that primarily related to the redesign of our backoffice software systems during 2018 we incurred restructuring charges of 264 million that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits and the closure of offices with noncancelable terms we paid 106 million and 247 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively related to these restructuring efforts 

in 2020 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 15 million primarily related to the redesign of our backoffice software systems substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment 

loss on extinguishment of debt during 2019 we did not incur any noncash losses on the early extinguishment of debt during 2018 we incurred a 03 million loss on the extinguishment of certain financing arrangements 

gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments net during 2019 and 2018 we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments related to business divestitures of 147 million and 449 million respectively 

acquisition integration and deal costs although our business regularly incurs costs related to acquisitions we specifically identify in the table above integration and deal costs of 66 million incurred during 2019 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs associated with particular acquisition activity during 2019 

firedamage related costs during the three months ended december 31 2019 certain of our owned and operated facilities in our group 1 segment were impacted by separate firerelated events although our business may incur firerelated damage to our leased or owned property plant and equipment from time to time we specifically identify in the table above firedamage related 

costs of 77 million incurred during 2019 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs incurred associated with these fires during 2019 

incremental contract startup costs  large municipal contract although our business regularly incurs startup costs under municipal contracts we specifically identify in the table above the startup costs with respect to an individual municipal contract and do not adjust for other startup costs under other contracts in 2019 or 2018 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs involved with this particular municipal contract and the unusual nature for the time period in which they were incurred during 2019 and 2018 we incurred costs of 07 million and 57 million respectively related to the implementation of this large municipal contract these costs did not meet the capitalization criteria prescribed by the new revenue recognition standard 

adoption of the tax act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 among other things the tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 during 2018 we adjusted the provisional amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 for the onetime transition tax deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions these adjustments increased our tax provision by 03 million 

bridgeton insurance recovery net during 2019 and 2018 we collected insurance recoveries of 240 million and 400 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri which we recognized as a reduction of remediation expenses in our cost of operations in addition we incurred 96 million and 120 million respectively of incremental costs attributable to the bridgeton insurance recoveries 

recent developments 

2020 financial guidance 

in 2020 we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returned to our shareholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2020 specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2020 revenue to increase by approximately 425 to 500 comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue the majority of these restricted pricing arrangements are tied to fluctuations in a specific index primarily a consumer price index as defined in the contract the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial effect of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2020 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap 



1 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2019 

the 2020 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21 and an approximately 110 million charge related to solar energy investments that qualify for tax credits the charge will be recorded as a loss from unconsolidated equity method investments 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes restructuring charges gain loss on business divestitures and impairments net acquisition integration and deal costs fire damage related costs incremental contract startup costs and certain insurance recoveries provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station landfill disposal recycling and environmental services our residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties our recycling processing facilities generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from environmental services consists mainly of fees we charge for disposal of nonhazardous solid and liquid waste and inplant services such as transportation and logistics environmental services waste is generated from the byproduct of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity additionally it is generated by the daily operations of industrial petrochemical and refining facilities including maintenance plant turnarounds and capital projects other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 29 and 25 2019 and 2018 respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 50 and 42 for 2019 and 2018 respectively 

during 2019 we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2018 

• average yield increased revenue by 28 due to positive pricing in all lines of business 

• the fuel recovery fee program which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices increased revenue due to an increase in the total revenue subject to the fuel recovery fees this increase was entirely offset by a decrease in fuel prices during 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 

• volume decreased revenue by 04 primarily due to declines in our residential and smallcontainer collection lines of business the volume declines in our collection lines of business were primarily due to certain nonregrettable losses during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 the volume decrease was partially offset by volume growth in our landfill and transfer station lines of business the volume increase in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and solid waste volumes which was partially offset by a decline in special waste volume 

• recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 03 primarily due to a decline in recycled commodity prices as compared to the same period in 2018 the average price for recycled commodities excluding glass and organics for 2019 was 77 per ton compared to 104 per ton for 2018 during 2019 and 2018 22 million and 24 million tons excluding glass and organics respectively were sold after being processed in our recycling processing centers 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 13 million and 13 million respectively 

• environmental services revenue decreased by 03 primarily due to a decline in upstream exploration and production drilling activity and increased competition in the permian basin 

• acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 08 due to our continued growth strategy of acquiring privately held solid waste recycling and environmental services companies that complement our existing business platform 

cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management costs which include insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

our cost of operations increased in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as a result of the following 

• labor and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases along with additional headcount attributable to acquisitionrelated growth 

• transfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to an increase in third party disposal rates and volumes disposed at third party facilities during both the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 approximately 68 of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization 

• maintenance and repairs expense remained relatively consistent year over year as a percentage of revenue 

• transportation and subcontract costs increased primarily due to increased third party transportation rates and acquisition related activity 

• fuel costs decreased due to a decline in both fuel prices and collection volumes as well as compressed natural gas cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 retroactively effective to january 2018 and recognized during the three months ended december 31 2019 the national average cost per gallon for diesel fuel in 2019 was 306 compared to 318 for 2018 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million per year 

• landfill operating expenses increased in aggregate dollars due to increased leachate treatment transportation and disposal costs partially offset by certain favorable remediation adjustments 

• risk management expenses increased primarily due to an increase in premiums for our current year programs in part due to our acquisitionrelated activity 

• other costs of operations increased during 2019 primarily due to an increase in occupancy and facility costs in addition we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our operating facilities in 2018 which did not recur in 2019 

• during the three months ended december 31 2019 we recognized 76 million of firerelated damage costs in our cost of operations that resulted from damage to our leased or owned property plant and equipment in our group 1 segment 

• during 2019 and 2018 we collected favorable insurance recoveries of 240 million and 400 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses in our consolidated statements of income for the applicable periods 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions partially offset by the full depreciation of certain assets recognized in our 2008 acquisition of allied waste industries inc 

landfill depletion and amortization increased due to higher landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by increased construction and demolition and solid waste volumes coupled with an overall increase in our average depletion rate per ton 

amortization of other intangible assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were 204 million and 564 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively or 02 of revenue for 2019 and 06 for 2018 our other intangible assets primarily relate to customer relationships and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization expense decreased primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets recognized in our 2008 acquisition of allied waste industries inc partially offset by additional assets acquired in 2019 

amortization of other assets 

expenses for amortization of other assets were 343 million or 03 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 79 million or 01 of revenue for the same period in 2018 our other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloudbased hosting arrangements effective january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201815 intangibles—goodwill and other—internaluse software subtopic 35040 no 201815 customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract asu 201815 on a prospective basis during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized 202 million of amortization related to the prepayment of fees as selling general and administrative expenses during 2019 we recognized 238 million of amortization related to the prepayment of similar fees in amortization of other assets 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 819 million and 807 million or 08 of revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties legal settlements marketing investor and community relations services directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges restructuring charges are excluded from selling general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately 

the following table summarizes our selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies 

the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative expenses during 2019 as compared to 2018 are summarized below 

• salaries increased primarily due to higher incentive pay and wages benefits and other payroll related items resulting from annual merit increases excluding the 96 million of incremental costs we incurred attributable to the bridgeton landfill insurance recovery 

• other selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to our adoption of asu 201815 during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized 202 million of amortization related to the prepayment of certain fees as selling general and administrative expenses the amortization for prepayments of similar fees was recognized as amortization of other assets during 2019 the decrease was partially offset by unfavorable legal settlements and consulting fees 

• during 2019 we recognized 63 million of acquisition integration and deal costs as selling general and administrative expenses 

gain on business divestitures and impairments net 

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets asset or business divestitures could result in gains losses or asset impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

during 2019 and 2018 we recorded a net gain on business divestitures net of asset impairments of 147 million and 449 million respectively 

restructuring charges 

in january 2018 we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select backoffice functions including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations during 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 142 million that primarily related to the redesign of our backoffice software systems during 2018 we incurred restructuring charges of 264 million that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits and the closure of offices with noncancelable terms we paid 106 million and 247 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively related to these restructuring efforts 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 



effective january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201602 leases topic 842 asc 842 or the new leasing standard using the optional transition method prescribed by asu 201811 leases topic 842 targeted improvements  under the new leasing standard we will present variable lease costs associated with our finance leases as a component of noncash interest expense variable lease costs are recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period incurred as such we expect noncash interest expense to fluctuate each period as the variable elements of these arrangements become known and the cost is incurred 

total interest expense for 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase in variable lease payments made in accordance with certain of our finance leases during 2019 and 2018 cash paid for interest excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps was 3468 million and 3510 million respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during 2019 we incurred no noncash loss on the early extinguishment of debt during 2018 we incurred a 03 million loss on the extinguishment of certain financing arrangements 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 2220 million and 2833 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively our effective income tax rate was 171 and 215 for 2019 and 2018 respectively we made income tax payments net of refunds of approximately 31 million and 210 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively cash paid for income taxes net of refunds for 2019 was favorably affected by 100 equipment deductions and tax credits related to our investment in solar energy assets 

during 2019 we acquired noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investments in the loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting see note 3 business acquisitions investments and restructuring charges  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k our 2019 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately 84 million due to the tax credits related to these investments in addition our 2019 tax provision was reduced by 134 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2018 tax returns and also reduced by 123 million due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation 

our 2018 tax provision was reduced by 121 million due to excess tax benefits approximately 50 million related to the tax credits from our noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets and approximately 6 million due to the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates following the completion of our 2017 tax returns 

we have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately 111 million available as of december 31 2019 these state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2019 and 2039 we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states in recognition of this risk as of december 31 2019 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 67 million 

as a result of the recent changes in us tax law as well as our ongoing efforts to streamline and maximize the efficiency of our tax footprint we could further adjust our valuation allowance in a future period if there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that certain of the state net operating loss carryforwards on which we currently provide a valuation allowance would be realized 

reportable segments 

our senior management evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states 

the two field groups group 1 and group 2 are presented below as our reportable segments which provide integrated waste management services consisting of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer recycling disposal and environmental services 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2019 compared to 2018 are discussed below 

group 1 

revenue for 2019 increased 39 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and increased volumes in our collection and transfer station lines of business these increases were partially offset by volume declines in our landfill line of business primarily attributable to special waste volumes 

operating income for group 1 increased from 11569 million for 2018 or a 240 operating margin to 12346 million for 2019 or a 247 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

• cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2019 primarily due to a decrease in labor and related benefits maintenance and repairs expenses and fuel costs as a result of cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and retroactively effective to january 2018 offset by an increase in transportation and subcontract costs and landfill operating expenses 

• landfill depletion and amortization favorably impacted operating income margin during 2019 primarily due to a decline in overall landfill volumes the decrease was partially offset by an increase in our overall depletion rate and favorable amortization adjustments related to our asset retirement obligations during 2018 compared to the adjustments recognized in 2019 

group 2 

revenue for 2019 increased 14 from 2018 primarily due to positive pricing in all lines of business and an increase in volume in our landfill line of business which was partially offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business 

operating income for group 2 increased from 9385 million for 2018 or a 185 operating margin to 9614 million for 2019 or an 187 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

• cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2019 primarily due to declines in our transfer and disposal costs and fuel costs as a result of cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and retroactively effective to january 2018 partially offset by an increase in landfill operating expenses 

• landfill depletion and amortization unfavorably impacted operating income margin during 2019 primarily due to an increase in our overall average depletion rate partially offset by favorable amortization adjustments to our asset retirement obligations during 2019 compared to the adjustments recognized in 2018 

corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased from 3596 million for 2018 to 4088 million for 2019 the operating loss for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by a lower gain on the disposition of assets in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 additionally we collected an insurance recovery of 240 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2019 as compared to the insurance recovery 400 million recognized in the same period in 2018 these recoveries were offset by 96 million and 120 million respectfully of incremental costs attributable to the recoveries 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment transportation and disposal costs methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable 

likelihood of being permitted changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

available airspace 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we owned or operated 189 and 190 active solid waste landfills respectively with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 50 billion and 51 billion inplace cubic yards respectively for these landfills the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity as measured in cubic yards of airspace 





total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 12 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these 12 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 57 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 62 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2019 



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2019 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 13356 million of which 758 million were current and 12598 million were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

during 2019 and 2018 we collected insurance recoveries of 240 million and 400 million respectively related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

for a description of our significant remediation matters see note 8 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

investment in landfills 

as of december 31 2019 we expect to spend an estimated additional 95 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 134 billion or 268 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

the following table reflects our future expected investment as of december 31 2019 in millions 



the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 



during 2019 and 2018 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars 





1 in accordance with our adoption of asu 201815 capitalized implementation costs for cloudbased hosting arrangements were transferred out of property and equipment net and are now presented as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019 





liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and marketable securities balances as of december 31 



our restricted cash and marketable securities include among other things restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts and permits and relating to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations and restricted cash related to a payment for a certain maturing taxexempt financing 

the following table summarizes our restricted cash and marketable securities as of december 31 



intended uses of cash 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

summary of cash flow activity 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2019 and 2018 are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 2276 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of 2163 million in 2018 primarily as a result of the following 

• our accounts receivable exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits increased 383 million during 2019 primarily due to growth in our revenue compared to a 296 million increase in 2018 as of december 31 2019 our days sales outstanding were 398 or 279 days net of deferred revenue compared to 397 or 275 days net of deferred revenue as of december 31 2018 

• our prepaid expenses and other assets increased 1097 million in 2019 compared to an increase of 1525 million in 2018 primarily due to the timing of our estimated tax payments cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was approximately 31 million and 210 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively cash paid for income taxes net of refunds for 2019 was favorably affected by 100 equipment deductions primarily attributable to capital expenditures and acquisitionrelated activity during the year and tax credits related to our investments in solar energy assets income taxes paid net of refunds in 2018 was favorably affected by the tax act and tax credits related to our investments in solar energy assets 

• our accounts payable increased 64 million during 2019 compared to an increase of 859 million during 2018 due to the timing of payments 

• cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations was 63 million higher during 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in cash paid for capping closure and postclosure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and postclosure payments at certain of our landfill sites 

• cash paid for remediation obligations was 03 million higher during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the timing of obligations 

in addition cash paid for interest was 3468 million and 3510 million excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps for 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2019 and 2018 are summarized below 

• capital expenditures during 2019 were 12071 million as compared to 10718 million for 2018 during 2019 we entered into finance leases with future lease liabilities of 159 million including finance leases acquired in business combination acquisitions 

• proceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2019 were 217 million as compared to 316 million for 2018 

• during 2019 and 2018 we used 5751 million and 2773 million respectively for acquisitions and investments net of cash acquired during 2019 and 2018 we received 428 million and 892 million for business divestitures respectively 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2019 and 2018 are summarized below 

• during 2019 we issued 9000 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 8911 million during 2018 we issued 8000 million of senior notes for cash proceeds net of discounts and fees of 7818 million net payments of notes payable and longterm debt were 5814 million during 2019 compared to net payments of 6531 million in 2018 for a more detailed discussion see the financial condition section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• during 2019 we repurchased 49 million shares of our stock for 3994 million during 2018 we repurchased 107 million shares of our stock for 7369 million in october 2017 our board of directors added 20 billion to the existing share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2019 there was 7046 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization 

• in july 2019 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to 0405 per share dividends paid were 4912 million and 4618 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively 

• during 2019 and 2018 cash paid for purchase price holdback releases related to acquisitions was 172 million and 121 million respectively 

financial condition 

debt obligations 

changes in our outstanding principal debt balances from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 were primarily attributable to debt cash borrowings net of principal debt payments of 3336 million and new finance leases which increased our debt obligations by 159 million 

as of december 31 2019 we had 9307 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months which includes certain senior notes variable rate taxexempt financings and finance lease obligations all of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful however if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us in the event of a failed remarketing we currently have availability under our 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully accordingly we have classified these borrowings as longterm in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 

for further discussion of the components of our overall debt see note 9 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

credit facilities 

in june 2018 we entered into a 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which replaced our 10 billion and 125 billion unsecured credit facilities that would have matured in may 2021 and june 2019 respectively the 

replaced credit facilities the credit facility matures in june 2023 we may request two oneyear extensions of the maturity date but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension the credit facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 10 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the credit facility agreement 

the credit facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facility and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2019 our ebitda to interest ratio was 754 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 299 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2020 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreement in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement this could also have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated 

availability under our credit facility totaled 16969 million and 16941 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the credit facility can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had 1844 million and 1590 million of borrowings under our credit facility respectively we had 3514 million and 3796 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we also have an uncommitted credit facility which bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had 116 million and 334 million of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility respectively 

senior notes and debentures 

as of december 31 2019 we had 72570 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2041 as of december 31 2018 we had 69988 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2041 our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations 

during 2019 we issued 9000 million of 2500 senior notes due 2024 the 2500 notes we used the net proceeds from the 2500 notes to repay 6500 million of 5500 senior notes that matured in september 2019 the remaining proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facilities as well as for general corporate purposes 

during 2018 we issued 8000 million of 3950 senior notes due 2028 the 3950 notes we used the net proceeds from the 3950 notes to repay 7000 million of 3800 senior notes that matured in may 2018 and the remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our replaced credit facilities in connection with this offering we terminated interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of 6000 million resulting in net proceeds of 311 million the proceeds will amortize over the term of the 3950 notes using the effective interest method there was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges 

interest rate swap and lock agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2019 these swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for 2019 

and 2018 we recognized 10 million and 19 million respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

as of december 31 2019 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 5750 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1330 to 3000 as of december 31 2018 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 7250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 3250 we entered into these transactions to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes in 2019 through 2021 upon the expected issuance of the senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31 2019 were assets of 36 million which were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet and liabilities of 157 million which were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31 2018 was 103 million and was recorded in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet 

see note 18 financial instruments  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further detail regarding the effect of our fair value and cash flow hedging on interest expense 

derivative contracts 

contemporaneously with the issuance of our 2500 notes in august 2019 we amended interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of 3750 million extending the mandatory maturity date from 2019 to 2024 and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges the extended interest rate swaps there was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges in addition we entered into an offsetting interest rate swap to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the extended interest rate swaps the offsetting interest rate swaps the fair value of these free standing derivatives was determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

as of december 31 2019 the fair value of the extended interest rate swaps was a liability of 222 million which was included in other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and the fair value of the offsetting interest rate swaps was an asset of 29 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a loss of 34 million on the change in fair value of the extended interest rate swaps with an offsetting gain of 29 million on the offsetting interest rate swaps the change in fair value was recorded directly in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2019 we had 11162 million of certain fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2049 as of december 31 2018 we had 10368 million of certain fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2044 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we refinanced 350 million of taxexempt financings and issued 300 million of new taxexempt financings in addition during the three months ended december 31 2019 we issued 500 million of variablerate taxexempt debt the proceeds from the issuance were used to fund qualifying landfillrelated capital expenditures in the state of california 

finance leases 

we had finance lease liabilities of 1193 million and 1095 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2049 and 2019 to 2046 respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2019 for variable rate debt the effect of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2019 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2019 and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2020 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than shortterm operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

contingencies 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  note 11 income taxes and note 19 commitments and contingencies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

• landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 

• landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping closure and postclosure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

landfill development costs 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 

• studies performed could be inaccurate which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 

• actions by neighboring parties private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain maintain or expand permits could result in denial revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit improved technical information as a project progresses or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment 

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 

• technical design requirements as approved may need modifications at some future point in time 

• technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

• estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 

• the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions including waste compaction practices site design climate and the nature of the waste 

• capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in yearoveryear cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

• actual future costs of construction materials and thirdparty labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions regulatory changes or legislative changes 

landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

• changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 17 in 2019 and 2018 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 43 in 2019 and 2018 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

• changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping closure activities or postclosure monitoring activities types and quantities of materials used or term of postclosure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 

• changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 

• actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping closure and postclosure liabilities 

• changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 

• changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the creditadjusted riskfree rate used to discount the liabilities which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities assets and expense 

• amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design postclosure monitoring requirements or the inflation or discount rate 

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

• we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement 

• we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources 

• there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project including political impediments 

• progress is being made on the project 

• the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame and 

• we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit 

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

• we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure accruals an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 

environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates 

of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly see our results of operations section in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

• we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events thus our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified the financial viability of those parties and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs and any adjustments could be material 

• actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 

• an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of income 

insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million to 10 million the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 

residual risks 

• incident rates including frequency and severity and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change which would be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 

• recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims adjustments if any to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

• the settlement costs to discharge our obligations including legal and health care costs could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our insurance reserves to change

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forwardlooking statement 



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 1001 million 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2019 our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

as of december 31 2019 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 5750 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1330 to 3000 as of december 31 2018 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 7250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 3250 we entered into these transactions to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes in 2019 through 2021 upon the expected issuance of senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties 

as of december 31 2019 we had 13184 million of floating rate debt and 3000 million of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 16 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk as of december 31 2019 we had no fuel hedges in place while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately 26 million per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3479 million in 2019 or 34 of revenue compared to 3914 million in 2018 or 39 of revenue and 3498 million in 2017 or 35 of revenue 

commodities price risk 

we market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling processing centers changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices in prior periods we have entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities as of december 31 2019 we had no recycling commodity hedges in place 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 13 million and 13 million respectively 

revenue from recycling processing and commodity sales during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 2732 million 2978 million and 5392 million respectively

business 

tableend overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2018  we operated facilities in 41 states and puerto rico through 349 collection operations 207 transfer stations 190 active landfills 91 recycling processing centers 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11 salt water disposal wells we are engaged in 75 landfill gastoenergy and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 129 closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

the five pillars of our strategy  profitable growth through differentiation 

we believe that our products and services are valuable and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation is built on five key pillars including 1 market position 2 operating model 3 people and talent agenda 4 customer zeal and 5 digital platform 

market position 

the goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 



markets where customers are demanding these services and demonstrating a willingness to pay and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

 external growth 

 we continue to invest in valueenhancing acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 200 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent highquality service to all of our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business 

organizational structure 

a key enabler of the republic way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

our senior management evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states each field group is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our field groups and all of our areas provide collection transfer recycling and landfill services see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

through this operating model we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way 

fleet automation 

approximately 75 of our residential routes have been converted to automated singledriver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng 

approximately 20 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is the most prudent approach to realizing the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 13 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2018 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2018  we operated 37 cng fueling stations 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the seventh largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2018  our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs the entire fleet was certified under onefleet by the second quarter of 2017 

people and talent agenda 

the goal of our people and talent agenda pillar is to create an environment to attract and retain the best talent our people continue to be the most critical component in successfully executing our strategy we strive to make republic a desirable place to work for our approximately 36000 fulltime employees by creating learning experiences and programs that develop train engage and motivate as well as compensation and benefits that attract and retain the best workforce with a focus on safety learning and talent development and diversity and inclusion we aspire to be a company where the best people want to work and are engaged every day 

safety 

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve due to the nature of our industry we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 10 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 40 better than the industry average our think choose live slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think about what you are doing choose the safe answer and live to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition that they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

we are proud of our two safety incentive programs dedicated to safety and dedicated to excellence for dedicated to safety employees must meet all safety requirements for the year including no preventable accidents and no safety warnings for dedicated to excellence employees must earn the dedicated to safety award and meet additional criteria for customer service attendance and other performance metrics further our safety training program focus 6 provides employees with tips and techniques to prevent the six most common types of serious accidents backing intersections pushpulllift rear collisions rollover and pedestrian 

we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award the national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year republic drivers have won 73 of the driver of the year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009 

learning and talent development 

we are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers targeted onboarding experiences including our driver training center supervisor onboarding and sales acceleration programs focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role our leadership trainee program an 18month rotational experience for recent college graduates is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth 

developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda from our leadership fundamentals program a program for all leaders of people to our leadership trainee and general manager acceleration programs for early career leaders we have developed programs and experiences to help ensure that as our leaders progress they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level our leadership fundamentals program was awarded the 2018 brandon hall group excellence award for best advance in leadership development our leadership trainee program has enabled us to place new leaders in key positions in the field and at our phoenix headquarters our general manager acceleration program is designed to enable its participants to become the next generation of general managers ongoing support for leaders is provided by way of a biweekly leadership videocast that reinforces the concepts from our leadership trainings challenges employees to continue to apply the key learnings and offers ongoing tools for addressing the more seasonal aspects of leading throughout the year over the last three years more than 4600 leaders have completed our leadership fundamentals program creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees 

diversity and inclusion 

we are actively and intentionally creating an environment in which all individuals are welcomed and valued our mosaic council continues to develop new strategies and activities to create a more diverse workforce and inclusive work environment through these efforts we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers in 2017 the mosaic council launched the women of republic networking group which was developed to provide a platform to empower members and enrich a diverse culture that values develops and advances women in leadership advancing women in leadership roles will provide greater diversity of thought and perspective which has been proven to drive better decision making 

we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2018 for example 50 of maintenance managers and 25 of general managers that we hired selfidentified as having served in the us army navy marines air force or coast guard 

customer zeal 

the goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs we believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

in addition to being committed to our customers and employees we are also committed to the communities we serve and to the environment we strive to be america’s preferred recycling and waste services partner at republic we believe in the preservation of our blue planet ®  to support a cleaner safer and healthier world 

we believe we have a responsibility to regenerate our planet with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day by driving increased recycling generating renewable energy and helping our customers be more resourceful additionally regulatory and market developments that are related to concerns about potential impacts from climate change present us with a strategic business opportunity to reduce our own emissions while also providing our customers with sustainable solutions that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions leading by example we are working diligently to improve our relationship with the environment and society in our own operations through decreased vehicle emissions innovative landfill technologies use of renewable energy community engagement and employee growth opportunities sustainability contributes to a cleaner world while also providing opportunities to improve brand awareness to increase customer loyalty to grow our business to motivate our employees and to differentiate republic from our competitors 

to maximize our efforts we have chosen to focus our sustainability platform around the following five areas 

 each of these areas has a significant effect on the environment and society and contributes to preserving our blue planet while enhancing the foundation of our business going forward we developed programs that enabled us to reduce our emissions by 25 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the five year period ended december 31 2018  including development of at least two landfill gastoenergy projects each year adding at least 150000 tons per year of recycling capacity and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet by 3 we achieved these goals in 2018 and will introduce new goals in 2019 in addition we have a safety goal to reduce our ohsa recordable rates by 7 year over year from 2013 to 2017 republic reduced its scope 1  2 greenhouse gas emissions by 156 

we have been steadily building on our sustainability progress and performance we were named to the north american and world dow jones sustainability indices djsi for a third consecutive year in 2018 we believe the djsi is the gold standard for corporate sustainability in addition we earned the cdp climate and supply chain climate management level distinctions 

these achievements demonstrate our ability to connect financial performance with environmental and social performance including addressing various risks and opportunities posed by climate change the rankings also highlight republics leadership in corporate governance environmental social and financial aspects of sustainability finally we released our fourth sustainability and gri reports which are available on our website at republicservicescomsustainability 

given the importance of corporate sustainability to our stakeholders republic created a dedicated sustainability and corporate responsibility committee of the board of directors in 2015 this committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance our corporate responsibilities our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risk including cyber security environmental and climate related risks and reputational risks we believe that republics environmental social and governance initiatives require a dedicated board committee due to the unique nature of sustainability risks which includes the time frame in which some of these risks will play out the difficulty in quantifying the impact of these risks the interconnected aspects of these risks and the challenges associated with managing uncertainty 

cash utilization strategy 

we take a consistent and balanced approach to capital allocation to drive longterm sustainable value for our shareholders our ability to steadily increase free cash flow allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy which includes investing in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa2 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2018  such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2018  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 0375 per share which represents an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year over the last five years our dividends have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 76 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2017 our board of directors added 20 billion to the existing share repurchase authorization that now extends through december 31 2020 as of december 31 2018  there was 11 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock and the parameters around which we repurchase our shares 

shareholder value 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management we have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters including governance executive compensation environmental and social matters 

management team 

we believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets will contribute to what we call our “composite strength” composite strength combines the vast varied experience and capability of both strong wasteindustry veterans and talented people from other industries additionally composite strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry  many of them from blue chip companies

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we have a strong national verticallyintegrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate where appropriate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 68 of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific verticallyintegrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling processing centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority it is profitable to do so and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste recovering and recycling of certain materials and energy services 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer and largecontainer solid waste collection services through 349 collection operations in 2018  approximately 75 of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 22 of our 

total revenue relates to residential services approximately 31 relates to smallcontainer services and approximately 22 relates to largecontainer services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling processing centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure through competitive bids which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer business we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform smallcontainer collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal our smallcontainer services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer collection business the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

we also provide recycling collection services tailored to our customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services 

we own or operate 207 transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5 of our revenue during 2018  our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling processing centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 190 active landfills our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue during 2018  as of december 31 2018  we had 37800 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2018  we operated 75 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

we also have responsibility for 129 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 91 recycling processing centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 3 of our revenue during 2018  approximately 73 of our recycling processing center volume is fiber based and includes occ onp and other mixed paper of the 51 million tons we sold during 2018  28 million tons moved through our recycling processing centers and 23 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 18 million and 18 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or largecontainer customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty processing facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

energy services 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11 salt water disposal wells energy services waste is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity including waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well production wastes and water produced during a wells operating life contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation and substances that require cleanup after a spill revenue is therefore primarily generated through waste managed from vertical and horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing production and cleanup activity as well as other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products in 2018  approximately 2 of our revenue was derived from energy services energy services activity varies across market areas that are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering quality of service and price from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations recycling facilities certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 



many of which are found in common household waste among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past several years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 

2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

 state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste food waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the 

technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally a decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental entities large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental entities we provide services to a number of these entities including numerous municipalities these governmental entities may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or energy services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on the quality of services andor price competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we 

were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers changes in refinery operations supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset increased fuel costs resulting from such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3914 million in 2018  or 39  of revenue compared to 3498 million in 2017  or 35 of revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2018  approximately 6 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements fuel hedges all of our fuel hedges settled on or before december 31 2018  additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for future years these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control for instance in 2017 the chinese government imposed strict limits on the import of recyclable materials including by restricting the amount of contaminants allowed in imported recycled paper these limitations decreased the demand for recyclable materials and resulted in lower commodity prices significant price fluctuations or increased operating costs may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows approximately 73 of our recycling processing center volume is fiber based and includes occ onp and other mixed paper 

historically to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2017 we entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted occ sales all of which expired in 2018 

at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 18 million and 18 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations although we have entered into hedging agreements to help offset volatility in recycled commodity prices in the past we cannot provide assurance that we will enter into these agreements in the future 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection transfer station and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required for our operations because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage such actions could also create risks related to our reputation which may limit our ability to do business responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation 

obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services including the operation of landfills cng fueling stations a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes including those relating to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances commonly referred to as pfas and other chemicals of emerging concern could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a 

specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions are part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these regulations may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental 

liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 84 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 



if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 24 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we contribute to 26 multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 18 of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of the five pillars of our strategy is to grow through enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings further any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws in addition emerging technologies that are used to recycle and process waste as an alternative to disposal of waste in landfills represent risks as well as opportunities to our current business model 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use information technology including computer and information networks in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information in connection with our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

legal proceedings 

tableend general legal proceedings 

we are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements in the normal course of our business we become involved in legal proceedings some may result in fines penalties or judgments against us which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as used herein the term legal proceedings refers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries excluding 1 ordinary course accidents general commercial liability and workers compensation claims which are covered by insurance programs subject to customary deductibles and which together with selfinsured employee health care costs are discussed in note 7 other liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k and 2 environmental remediation liabilities which are discussed in note 8 landfill and environmental costs to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k  

we accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable we have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately 23 million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of december 31 2018  as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our legal proceedings and where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range if we had used the high ends of such ranges our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 14 million higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2018  

legal proceedings over certain environmental matters involving governmental authorities with possible sanctions of 100000 or more 

item 103 of the secs regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions will not equal or exceed 100000 we are disclosing the following matters in accordance with that requirement

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2018  we operated facilities in 41 states and puerto rico through 349 collection operations 207 transfer stations 190 active landfills 91 recycling processing centers 7 treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11 salt water disposal wells we are engaged in 75 landfill gastoenergy and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 129 closed landfills 

on january 1 2018 we adopted financial accounting standards boards fasb asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customer topic 606 and other assets and deferred costscontracts with customer subtopic 34040 asu 201409 or the new revenue recognition standard using the modified retrospective approach the results presented below for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 reflect our historical presentation prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 remained consistent at 100409 million compared to 100415 million for the same period in 2017  excluding the impact from the new revenue recognition standard revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 increased in the aggregate by 40  this change in revenue is due to increases in total price including fuel recovery fees of 30  acquisitions net of divestitures of 15  volume of 04  and energy services of 02  partially offset by the impact of recycling processing and commodity sales of 11  the impact from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard entirely offset these increases in revenue 

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 13209 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 12821 million and 9659 million in 2017 and 2016  respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 10369 million  or 316 per diluted share for 2018  compared to 12784 million  or 377 per diluted share for 2017  and 6126 million  or 178 per diluted share for 2016  

during each of 2018  2017 and 2016  we recorded a number of charges other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our cost of operations  selling general and administrative expenses and income taxes discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

  

1 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2018  

2 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2017  

3 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2016  

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods although our business regularly incurs startup costs under municipal contracts we specifically identify in the table above the startup costs with respect to an individual municipal contract and do not adjust for other startup costs under other contracts in 2018 or 2017 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs involved with this particular municipal contract and the unusual nature for the time period in which they are incurred we adjusted for the impact associated with our adoption of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act due to the significant decrease in the federal corporate tax rate and the magnitude of the effect on our operating results in the case of the bridgeton insurance recovery we adjusted for the impact due to the significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often realize recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results our definitions of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds during 2017 and 2016  we recorded charges to earnings of 12 million and 56 million  respectively for withdrawal events at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute as we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

restructuring charges in january 2018 we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select backoffice functions including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations during 2018  we incurred restructuring charges of 264 million that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits the closure of offices with noncancelable lease agreements and the redesign of our backoffice functions 

and software systems we expect annual savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million as a result of these restructuring efforts we paid 247 million during 2018 related to these restructuring efforts 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters additionally in the second quarter of 2016 we began the redesign of our backoffice functions as well as the consolidation of over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the redesign of our backoffice functions and software systems continued into 2018 during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  we incurred 176 million and 407 million of restructuring charges respectively that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits transition costs relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms these savings have been reinvested in our customerfocused programs and initiatives 

in 2019 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 5 million primarily related to the consolidation of backoffice functions upgrades to backoffice software systems lease exit and contract termination costs and the relocation of certain employees substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment 

loss on extinguishment of debt during 2018  we incurred a 03 million loss on the extinguishment of certain financing arrangements in the fourth quarter of 2017  we retired 867 million of 525 taxexempt bonds due june 2023 resulting in a noncash charge for deferred issuance costs of 08 million  during 2016  we completed cash tender offers to purchase 5754 million of outstanding notes and debentures with coupons ranging from 57 to 74 the existing notes additionally we issued 5000 million of 290 senior notes due 2026 the 290 notes and used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase the 5754 million of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes we also used the net proceeds to pay a premium due of 1481 million and early tender consideration of 287 million 

gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments net during 2018  we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments related to business divestitures of 449 million  during 2017  we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments related to business divestitures of 271 million  we also recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments of 68 million due to the transfer of ownership of the landfill gas collection and control system and the remaining postclosure and environmental liabilities associated with one of our divested landfills during 2016  we recorded a charge to earnings of 46 million primarily related to environmental costs associated with one of our divested landfills during 2016  we also recorded a net gain related to a business divestiture of 47 million 

incremental contract startup costs  large municipal contract during 2018 and 2017  we incurred costs of 57 million and 82 million  respectively related to the implementation of a large municipal contract these costs did not meet the capitalization criteria prescribed by the new revenue recognition standard 

adoption of the tax act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 among other things the tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional amounts based on our estimates of the tax acts effect to our deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and onetime transition tax these adjustments reduced our tax provision by 4639 million  during 2018  we adjusted the provisional amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 for the onetime transition tax deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions these adjustments increased our tax provision by 03 million  

bridgeton insurance recovery net during 2018  we collected an insurance recovery of 400 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri which we recognized as a reduction of remediation expenses in our cost of operations in addition we incurred 120 million of incremental costs attributable to the bridgeton insurance recovery 

recent developments 

2019 financial guidance 

in 2019  we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returned to our shareholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2019  specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2019 revenue to increase by approximately 425 to 475 comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue the majority of these restricted pricing arrangements are tied to fluctuations in a specific index primarily a consumer price index as defined in the contract the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial effect of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2019 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2018  adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap 



the 2019 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 24 and an approximately 60 million charge related to solar energy investments that qualify for tax credits the charge will be recorded as a loss from unconsolidated equity method investments 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes restructuring charges gain loss on business divestitures and impairments net incremental contract startup costs and certain insurance recoveries provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station landfill disposal recycling and energy services our residential smallcontainer and largecontainer collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from energy services consists mainly of fees we charge for the treatment and disposal of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



1 in accordance with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard municipal franchise fees are presented as a reduction to revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  similar fees are presented as a cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016

the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 25 26 and 23 for 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 42 43 and 37 for 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively 

revenue – 2018 compared to 2017 

during 2018  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2017  

 changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 18 million and 18 million  respectively 



revenue – 2017 compared to 2016 

during 2017  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2016  

 cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management costs which include casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



1 disposal fees and taxes included municipal franchise fees of 1568 million and 1532 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  respectively in accordance with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard these fees were presented as a reduction to revenue for the same respective period in 2018 

2 cost of goods sold included rebates paid to customers associated with recycled commodities for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  in accordance with our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard these rebates were presented as a reduction to revenue for the same respective period in 2018 

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

cost of operations  2018 compared to 2017 

our cost of operations decreased for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017  primarily due to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard for the year ended december 31 2018  we recognized 3370 million of municipal franchise fees and rebates paid to customers associated with recycled commodities as a reduction to revenue historically these costs were presented as a cost of operations 

excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard our cost of operations increased for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017  the following items impacted the major components of our cost of operations for the year ended december 31 2018  

 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million per year 

 during 2018  we collected a favorable insurance recovery of 400 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses 

 cost of operations – 2017 compared to 2016 

our cost of operations increased for 2017 compared to 2016  primarily as a result of the following

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2018 compared to 2017 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to the higher acquisition cost of replacement vehicles additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles 

landfill depletion and amortization increased due to higher landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by increased solid and special waste volumes coupled with an overall increase in our average depletion rate per ton this increase was offset by favorable adjustments related to our estimate of future landfill capping retirement obligations 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2017 compared to 2016 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to an increase in the cost of replacement vehicles increased trucks to support volume growth additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles

amortization of other intangible assets and other assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets and other assets were 564 million  710 million and 713 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively or 06  of revenue for 2018  07 for 2017 and 08 for 2016  our other intangible assets and other assets primarily relate to customer relationships franchise agreements other municipal agreements favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements in addition we historically recognized certain upfront payments to acquire customer contracts as a deferred charge in our consolidated balance sheet and amortized the asset as a component of depreciation amortization and depletion over the respective contract life in accordance with the new revenue recognition standard we amortized the asset as a reduction of revenue during the year ended december 31 2018  amortization expense further decreased due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets recognized in our 2008 acquisition of allied 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 807 million  798 million and 791 million  or 08  of revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016  accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period

selling general and administrative expenses – 2018 compared to 2017 

salaries remained relatively unchanged as compared to 2017  excluding the 120 million of incremental costs we incurred attributable to the bridgeton landfill insurance recovery 

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in third party consulting costs 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2017 compared to 2016 

salaries increased primarily due to higher wages benefits and other payroll related items resulting from merit increases 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a favorable legal settlement during 2016 additionally we had an increase in acquisitionrelated transaction costs associated with our increased acquisition activity during the year 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds 

during 2017 and 2016  we recorded charges to earnings of 12 million and 56 million respectively for withdrawal events at multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute as we obtain updated information regarding the multiemployer pension funds the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

gain on business divestitures and impairments net 

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets asset or business divestitures could result in gains losses or asset impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

during 2018  we recorded a net gain on business divestitures net of asset impairments of 449 million  

during 2017  we recorded a net gain on business divestitures net of asset impairments of 271 million  we also recorded a gain on business divestitures of 68 million due to the transfer of ownership of the landfill gas collection and control system and the remaining postclosure and environmental liabilities associated with one of our divested landfills

in january 2018 we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select backoffice functions including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations during 2018  we incurred restructuring charges of 264 million that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits the closure of offices with noncancelable lease agreements and the redesign of our backoffice functions and upgrades to certain of our software systems we paid 247 million during 2018 related to these restructuring efforts 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters additionally in the second quarter of 2016 we began the redesign of our backoffice functions as well as the consolidation of over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the redesign of our backoffice functions and upgrades to certain of our software systems continued into 2018 during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  we incurred 176 million and 407 million of restructuring charges respectively that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits transition costs relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms the savings realized from these restructuring efforts have been reinvested in our customerfocused programs and initiatives 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 



total interest expense for 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the increase in debt outstanding during the period and higher interest rates on floating rate debt total interest expense for 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to the issuance of 5000 million of 290 senior notes in july 2016 that were used to purchase outstanding notes and debentures with coupons ranging from 570 to 740 as a result of the debt that was extinguished in 2016 total interest expense for 2016 increased primarily due to 72 million of unamortized cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings as noncash interest expense 

during 2018  2017 and 2016  cash paid for interest excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps was 3510 million  3269 million and 3302 million  respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during 2018  we incurred a 03 million loss on the extinguishment of certain financing arrangements 

during 2017  we retired 867 million of 525 taxexempt bonds resulting in a noncash charge of 08 million  

during 2016  we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt we paid a cash premium of 1481 million  early tender consideration of 287 million and 16 million of associated legal and other fees we also incurred a noncash charge related to the proportional share of unamortized discounts and deferred issuance costs of 178 million the unamortized proportional share of certain cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings as noncash interest expense was 72 million 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 2833 million  31 million and 3527 million for 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively our effective income tax rate was 215  02 and 365 for 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively we made income tax payments net of refunds of approximately 210 million  370 million and 265 million for 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively cash paid for income taxes net of refunds for 2018 was favorably affected by the tax act and our investment in solar energy assets 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 limits deductions for among other things interest expense executive compensation and meals and entertainment while enhancing deductions for equipment and other fixed assets the tax act also requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides up to a one year measurement period from the tax acts enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under asc 740 

in accordance with sab 118 for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded provisional amounts based on our estimate of the tax acts effect on our deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and the onetime transition tax in aggregate the provisional amounts reduced our 2017 tax provision by approximately 464 million  

during the year ended december 31 2018 we adjusted the provisional amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 for the onetime transition tax deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in connection with the filing of our 2017 tax return these adjustments resulted in a net charge to the tax provision of 03 million  

as of december 31 2018 our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax act is complete 

the tax act also created a new requirement that certain global intangible low taxed income gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations cfcs must be included currently in gross income of the cfcs us shareholder under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes the deferral method as we do not expect to have significant future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti we have selected the period cost method 

outside of the impact of the tax act our 2018 tax provision was reduced by 64 million due to the realization of tax credits and lower state tax rates due to changes in estimates following the completion of our 2017 tax returns 

we reduced our 2018 tax provision by 121 million due to excess tax benefits required to be recorded to the income statement resulting from the adoption of fasbs asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 prior to 2017 these benefits were recorded directly to shareholders’ equity 

in addition during 2018 we acquired noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code our 2018 tax provision was reduced by approximately 50 million due to the tax credits related to these investments we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investments in the loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statement of income for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting see note 3 business acquisitions investments and restructuring charges  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

we have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately 118 million available as of december 31 2018 these state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2018 and 2038 we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states in recognition of this risk as of december 31 2018 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 73 million  

as a result of the recent changes in us tax law as well as our ongoing efforts to streamline and maximize the efficiency of our tax footprint we could further adjust our valuation allowance in a future period if there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that certain of the state net operating loss carryforwards on which we currently provide a valuation allowance would be realized 

as noted above our 2017 tax provision reflected provisional amounts related to the tax act as a net reduction in our tax provision of approximately 464 million  in addition our 2017 tax provision was reduced by 196 million in excess tax benefits from asu 201609 approximately 13 million related to the tax credits acquired from noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets and approximately 9 million due to the resolution of various state and federal tax matters as well as the realization of tax credits and lower state tax rates due to changes in estimates 

our 2016 tax provision was reduced by approximately 13 million due to the resolution of various state and federal tax matters as well as the realization of tax credits and lower state tax rates due to changes in estimates and approximately 10 million related to tax credits acquired from noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets 

reportable segments 

our senior management evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states 

the two field groups group 1 and group 2 are presented below as our reportable segments which provide integrated waste management services consisting of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer recycling disposal and energy services 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2018 compared to 2017  and 2017 compared to 2016  are discussed below 

2018 compared to 2017   

group 1 

revenue for 2018 decreased 13 from 2017 primarily due to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and a decrease in recycling processing and commodity sales excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard revenue increased due to positive pricing and an increase in volumes in all lines of business 

operating income for group 1 increased from 11351 million for 2017  or a 233 operating margin to 11569 million for 2018  or a 240 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

 group 2 

revenue for 2018 increased 31 from 2017 primarily due to positive pricing in all lines of business which was partially offset by a decrease attributable to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and a decrease in recycling processing and commodity sales additionally volume increased in our landfill transfer stations and largecontainer collection lines of business partially offset by volume declines in our commercial and residential lines of business attributable to nonregrettable losses 

operating income in group 2 decreased from 9459 million for 2017  or a 192 operating margin to 9385 million for 2018  or an 185 operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities decreased from 4125 million for 2017 to 3596 million for 2018  the operating loss for 2018 was favorably impacted by certain onetime actuarial developments and an insurance recovery of 400 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2018 which was offset by 120 million of incremental costs attributable to the recovery in addition we recognized cng tax credits that were enacted in 2018 and retroactively effective in 2017 

2017 compared to 2016   

group 1 

revenue for 2017 increased 69 from 2016 primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all lines of business additionally we recognized increased recycled commodity revenue due to the increase in commodity prices 

operating income for group 1 increased from 10594 million for 2016  or a 232 operating margin to 11351 million for 2017  or a 233 operating margin primarily as a result of increased revenue the increase in operating income was offset by the following items 

 group 2 

revenue for 2017 increased 60 from 2016 primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer collection and disposal lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes these increases were partially offset by declines in our residential collection and smallcontainer collection lines of business 

operating income in group 2 increased from 8630 million for 2016  or an 186 operating margin to 9459 million  or a 192 operating margin primarily as a result of an increase in revenue the increase in operating income was offset by the following items 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased from 3849 million for 2016 to 4125 million for 2017  the operating loss for 2017 was favorably impacted by a decrease in restructuring charges of 231 million from the same period in 2016 and gain on disposition of businesses offsetting these favorable items were increases in salaries and related benefits due to certain employees relocating from our field operations to our corporate segment as a result of our restructuring increased hourly and salaried wages as a result of merit increases increased facility costs as a result of our restructuring as well as unfavorable actuarial developments in certain of our insurance programs additionally we had favorable legal settlements in 2016 that did not recur in 2017 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment transportation and disposal costs methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 







changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or operated 190 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 51 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2018  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 47 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 03 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  twelve of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these twelve landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 56 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 63 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2018  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2018  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 12920 million  of which 767 million were current and 12153 million were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill during the year ended december 31 2018  we paid 162 million related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts from time to time this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures which could result in changes to our expected liability as of december 31 2018  the remediation liability recorded for this site was 1611 million  of which approximately 15 million is expected to be paid during 2019  we believe the remaining reasonably possible highend of our range would be approximately 171 million higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2018  

during 2018  we collected an insurance recovery of 400 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations 

west lake landfill superfund site  our subsidiary bridgeton landfill llc is one of several currently designated potentially responsible parties for the west lake landfill superfund site west lake in missouri on september 27 2018 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a record of decision amendment for west lake that includes a total undiscounted cost estimate of 229 million over a four to five year design and construction timeline at this time we are neither able to predict the final design of that remedy nor estimate how much of the future response costs of the site our subsidiary may agree or be required to pay during any subsequent administrative proceedings or litigation our subsidiary will vigorously contest liability for the costs of remediating radiologicallyimpacted materials generated on behalf of the federal government during the manhattan project and delivered to the site by an atomic energy commission licensee and its subcontractor currently we believe we are adequately reserved for our expected remediation liability however subsequent events related to remedy design divisibility or allocation may require us to modify our expected remediation liability 

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016 in millions 





  

as of december 31 2018  we expect to spend an estimated additional  94 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  132 billion  or  260 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

the following table reflects our future expected investment as of december 31 2018 in millions 



the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



during 2018 and 2017  our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016 in millions of dollars 













liquidity and capital resources 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2018  2017 and 2016 are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

2018 compared to 2017   

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 2163 million in 2018  compared to a decrease of 2309 million in 2017  primarily as a result of the following 

 in addition cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was approximately 210 million and 370 million for 2018 and 2017  respectively income taxes paid net of refunds in 2018 was favorably affected by the tax act and our investment in solar energy assets income taxes paid net of refunds in 2017 reflect the passage of the tax act which provided for 100 equipment expensing on qualified assets placed in service after september 27 2017 and the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act which provided for bonus depreciation deductions on assets placed in service in 2017 at 50 of the capitalized value cash paid for interest was 3510 million and 3269 million  excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps for 2018 and 2017  respectively 

2017 compared to 2016   

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decrease d our cash flow from operations by 2309 million in 2017  compared to a decrease of 2052 million in 2016  primarily as a result of the following 



 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 370 million and 265 million for 2017 and 2016  respectively income taxes paid in 2017 reflect the passage of the tax act which provided for 100 equipment expensing on qualified assets placed in service after september 27 2017 and the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act which provided for bonus depreciation deductions on assets placed in service in 2017 at 50 of the capitalized value income taxes paid in 2016 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 cash paid for interest was 3269 million and 3302 million for 2017 and 2016  respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2018  2017 and 2016 are summarized below 

 we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2018  2017 and 2016 are summarized below 



financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2018  we had 705 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1081 million of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 295 million of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 786 million of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

credit facilities 

in june 2018 we entered into a 225 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which replaced our 10 billion and 125 billion unsecured credit facilities that would have matured in may 2021 and june 2019 respectively the replaced credit facilities the credit facility matures in june 2023 we may request two oneyear extensions of the maturity date but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension the credit facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 10 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the credit facility agreement 

the credit facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facility and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2018  our ebitda to interest ratio was 744 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 296 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2019 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreement in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement this could also have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated 

availability under our credit facility totaled 16941 million as of december 31 2018  the credit facility can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2018  we had 1590 million of borrowings under our credit facility and as of december 31 2017 we had 1300 million of borrowings under the replaced credit facilities we had 3796 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2018 and  4627 million of letters of credit outstanding under our replaced credit facilities as of december 31 2017  

during 2016 we amended our existing unsecured bilateral credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility to increase the size to 1350 million with all other terms remaining unchanged our uncommitted credit facility bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin and is subject to facility fees defined in the uncommitted credit facility agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2018  we had 334 million of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility and no borrowings as of december 31 2017 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2018 we issued 8000 million of 3950 senior notes due 2028 the 3950 notes we used the net proceeds from the 3950 notes to repay 7000 million of 3800 senior notes that matured in may 2018 and the remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our replaced credit facilities in connection with this offering we terminated interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of 6000 million resulting in net proceeds of 311 million  the proceeds will amortize over the term of the 3950 notes using the effective interest method there was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges 

during 2017  we issued 6500 million of 3375 notes due 2027 the 3375 notes we used the net proceeds from the 3375 notes to repay amounts borrowed under our replaced credit facilities 

during 2016 we completed cash tender offers to purchase up to 5754 million combined aggregate principal amount of the 620 notes due march 2040 570 notes due may 2041 740 debentures due september 2035 and 609 notes due march 2035 collectively the existing notes subject to priority levels and the other terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase during 2016 we issued 5000 million of 290 senior notes due 2026 the 290 notes the sale of the 290 notes and the tender offers closed on july 5 2016 we used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase 5754 million of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes tendered as well as premium due of 1481 million and early tender consideration of 287 million  

as of december 31 2018 and 2017  we had 69988 million and 69130 million  respectively of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2041  our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations 

interest rate swap and lock agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2018  these swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for 2018  2017 and 2016  we recognized 19 million  48 million and 63 million  respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

as of december 31 2018  our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 7250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 3250  as of december 31 2017 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 8250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 2418  we entered into these transactions to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes in 2019 and 2020 upon the expected issuance of the senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties the aggregate fair values of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31 2018 and 2017 were 103 million and 191 million  respectively and were recorded in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017  we had 10368 million and 10360 million  respectively of certain fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2044  approximately 100 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds 

during 2017 we retired 867 million of 525 taxexempt bonds in advance of the maturity date additionally the california pollution control financing authority cpcfa adopted a resolution approving the issuance and sale of up to 1000 million of solid waste disposal revenue bonds for the benefit of republic under which cpcfa issued 500 million of variablerate taxexempt debt on our behalf the proceeds from the issuance were used to fund qualifying landfillrelated capital expenditures in the state of california 

intended uses of cash 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2018 for variable rate debt the effect of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2018  

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2018 and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2019  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

contingencies 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  note 10 income taxes and note 18 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

landfill development costs 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 



 technical landfill design   upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in yearoveryear cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and 

value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 17 in both 2018 and 2017 and 18 in 2016 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 43 in both 2018 and 2017 and 375 in 2016 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity

environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

 insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million to 10 millio n the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 

residual risks 



loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1st or when an indicator of impairment exists we compare the fair value of our reporting units with the carrying value including goodwill we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value not to exceed the total amount of recorded goodwill as applicable 

during 2018 we managed and evaluated our operations through two field groups group 1 and group 2 in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to be approximately 3 annually 2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 27  3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7 and 8  and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 we conclude that we may not recover a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our two reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of october 1 2018 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control 

as of october 1 2018 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 110 on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

 income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred taxes and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 when it is not more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement”   



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 1077 million  

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2018  our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

as of december 31 2018  our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 7250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 3250  as of december 31 2017  our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of 8250 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900 to 2418  we entered into these transactions to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes in 2019 and 2020 upon the expected issuance of senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties 

as of december 31 2018  we had 12347 million of floating rate debt and 3000 million of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 15 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3914 million in 2018  or 39  of revenue compared to 3498 million in 2017  or 35 of revenue and 3170 million in 2016  or 34 of revenue 

previously we have entered into fuel hedge swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices as of december 31 2018  all of our fuel hedges have settled and we have not entered into any additional hedges see note 17 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for additional discussion 

commodities price risk 

we market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling processing centers changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices we have previously entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 18 million and 18 million  respectively as of december 31 2018  all of our recycling commodity hedges settled and we have not entered into any additional derivative instruments

business 

tableend overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2017  we operated in 40 states and puerto rico through 343  collection operations 204  transfer stations 195  active landfills 90  recycling centers 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11  salt water disposal wells we also operated 68  landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 124  closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

based on an industry trade publication the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 60 billion of which approximately 45 is generated by publicly owned waste companies industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous solid waste services industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35 and 20 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to population growth and growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

the five pillars of our strategy  profitable growth through differentiation 

we believe that our products and services are valuable and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation   is built on five key pillars including 1 market position 2 operating model 3 people and talent agenda 4 customer zeal and 5 digital platform 

market position 

the goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts market changes and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 



 external growth 

 we continue to invest in accretive acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 100 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent highquality service to all of our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business 

a key enabler of the republic way is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient and environmentally sound way 

fleet automation 

approximately 75 of our residential routes have been converted to automated singledriver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng   

approximately 19 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is the most prudent approach to realizing the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 30 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2017  were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2017  we operated 37 cng fueling stations 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the seventh largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2017  our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs we have implemented standardized maintenance programs for 100 of our fleet maintenance operations as of december 31 2017  the entire fleet was certified under onefleet by the second quarter of 2017 

organizational structure 

our senior management evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western and portions of the midwestern united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in texas the southeastern and portions of the midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states each field group is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our field groups and all of our areas provide collection transfer recycling and landfill services see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

people and talent agenda 

the goal of our people and talent agenda pillar is to create an environment to attract and retain the best talent our people continue to be the most critical component in successfully executing our strategy we strive to make republic a desirable place to work for our approximately 35000 fulltime employees by creating learning experiences programs compensation and benefits that attract develop train engage motivate reward and retain the best workforce with a focus on safety learning and talent development and diversity and inclusion we aspire to be a company where the best people want to work and are engaged every day 

safety   

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve due to the nature of our industry we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 10 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 41 better than the industry average our think choose live  slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think  about what you are doing choose  the safe answer and live  to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and the equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition that they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

we are proud of our two safety incentive programs dedicated to safety and dedicated to excellence for dedicated to safety employees must meet all safety requirements for the year including no preventable accidents and no safety warnings for dedicated to excellence employees must earn the dedicated to safety award and meet additional criteria for customer service attendance and other performance metrics further our safety training program focus 6 provides employees with tips and techniques to prevent the six most common types of serious accidents backing intersections pushpulllift rear collisions rollover and pedestrian 

we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award the national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year republic drivers have won 75 of the driver of the year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009 

learning and talent development 

we are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers targeted onboarding experiences including our driver training center supervisor onboarding and sales acceleration programs focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role our leadership trainee program an 18month rotational experience for recent college graduates is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth 

developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda from leadership fundamentals a program for new front line supervisors to our leadership trainee and general manager acceleration programs for early career leaders we have developed programs and experiences to help ensure that as our leaders progress they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level our leadership trainee program has enabled us to place new leaders in key positions in the field and at our phoenix headquarters our general manager acceleration program is designed to enable its participants to become the next generation of general managers and we are positioned to begin our next class in the third quarter of 2018 over the last three years more than 2800 leaders have completed our leadership fundamentals program creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees 

diversity and inclusion 

we are actively and intentionally creating an environment in which all individuals are welcomed and valued in 2013 we launched mosaic as our renewed approach and commitment to diversity and inclusion through mosaic we have developed new strategies and activities to continue creating a more diverse workforce and inclusive work environment in this way we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers in 2017 we launched the women of republic networking group which was developed to provide a platform to empower members and enrich a diverse culture that values develops and advances women in leadership 

we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2017 for example 20 of general managers 30 of operations managers and 27 of maintenance managers that we hired selfidentified as having served in the us army navy marines air force or coast guard 

customer zeal 

the goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs we believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service 

to help our sales team with their ability to identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering we use a priority based selling pbs technique and our capture pricing tool nationwide 



 in response to our customers’ requests we expanded our suite of products to include electronics recycling with blueguard ®  universal recycling and allinone office ®  for those services that we don’t provide we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship 

to help ensure a consistent customer experience we invested in our customer service capabilities and have made continued progress on the consolidation of our over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the new stateoftheart facilities and the technology deployed provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service across a myriad of touch points including voice email text social media channels and live chat the stateoftheart centers enhance the customer experience and will lower the cost to service our customers

 we believe that leveraging technology to improve our core business strengthens our existing model and customer relationships and will serve to solidify our differentiated offering 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

in addition to being committed to our customers and employees we are also committed to the communities we serve and to the environment we strive to be america’s preferred recycling and waste services partner at republic we believe in the preservation of our blue planet ®   to support a cleaner safer and healthier world 

we believe we have a responsibility to regenerate our planet with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day by driving increased recycling generating renewable energy and helping our customers be more resourceful additionally regulatory and market developments that are related to concerns about potential impacts from climate change present us with a strategic business opportunity to reduce our own emissions while also providing our customers with sustainable solutions that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions leading by example we are working diligently to improve our relationship with the environment and society through decreased vehicle emissions innovative landfill technologies use of renewable energy community engagement and employee growth opportunities sustainability contributes to a cleaner world while also providing opportunities to improve brand awareness to increase customer loyalty to grow our business to motivate our employees and to differentiate republic from our competitors 

to maximize our efforts we have chosen to focus our sustainability platform around the following five areas 



 each of these areas has a significant effect on the environment and society and contributes to preserving our blue planet while forming the foundation of our business going forward we have developed programs that we believe will enable us to reduce our emissions by 25 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by the end of 2018 including developing at least two landfill gastoenergy projects each year adding at least 150000 tons per year of recycling capacity and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet by 3 by the end of 2018 we added a safety goal in 2017 to prospectively reduce our ohsa recordable rates by 7 per year from 2013 through 2016 republic reduced its scope 1  2 greenhouse gas emissions by 127 

we have been steadily building on our sustainability progress and performance recently we were named to the north american and world dow jones sustainability indices djsi for a second consecutive year we believe the djsi is the gold standard for corporate sustainability republic is the only recycling and solid waste collection provider in the world to be named to either the north american or world indices in addition we have earned the cdp climate management level and supplier climate management distinctions republic uses these tools as a way to identify our strengths and weaknesses as they relate to climaterelated impacts and enhance our management processes to reduce our carbon footprint 

these achievements demonstrate our ability to connect financial performance with environmental and social performance including addressing various risks and opportunities posed by climate change the rankings also highlight republics leadership in corporate governance environmental social and financial aspects of sustainability finally we released our third sustainability report that follows the gri g4 protocol which is available on our website at wwwrepublicservicescomsustainability 

republic is one of the few fortune 500 companies whose board has a sustainability and corporate responsibility committee this committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance our corporate responsibilities our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risk including cyber security environmental and climate related risks and reputational risks 

cash utilization strategy 

we take a consistent and balanced approach to capital allocation to drive longterm sustainable value for our shareholders our ability to steadily increase free cash flow allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy which includes investing in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa3 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2017  such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2017  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 0345 per share which represents an increase of approximately 8 over the prior year over the last five years our dividend has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 80 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2017  our board of directors added 20 billion  to the existing share repurchase authorization that now extends through december 31 2020 as of december 31 2017  there was 18 billion  remaining under our share repurchase authorization on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock 

shareholder value 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management we have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters including governance and executive compensation 

management team 

we believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets will contribute to what we call our “composite strength” composite strength combines the vast varied experience and capability of both strong wasteindustry veterans and talented people from other industries additionally composite strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry  many of them from blue chip companies

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe republic is a company with a strong national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 68  of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority it is profitable to do so and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste recovering and recycling of certain materials and energy services 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer and largecontainer solid waste collection services through 343  collection operations in 2017  approximately 74  of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 23  of our total revenue relates to residential services approximately 30  relates to smallcontainer services and approximately 21  relates to largecontainer services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure through competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer business we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform smallcontainer collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our smallcontainer services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer collection business the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

we also provide recycling collection services tailored to our customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services 

we own or operate 204  transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2017  our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 195  active landfills our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 12  of our revenue during 2017  as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 37400  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2017  we operated 68 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

we also have responsibility for 124  closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 90  recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2017  approximately 77  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper of the 50 million tons we sold during 2017  25 million moved through our recycling centers and 25 million we collected and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 20 million  and 20 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or largecontainer customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

energy services 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11  salt water disposal wells energy services waste is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity including waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well production wastes and water produced during a wells operating life contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation and substances that require cleanup after a spill revenue is therefore primarily generated through waste managed from vertical and horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing production and cleanup activity as well as other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products in 2017  approximately 2  of our revenue was derived from energy services energy services activity varies across market areas that are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publicly owned companies several regional publicly and privately owned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations recycling facilities certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 



subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past several years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

 state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations  section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or energy services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an adequate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers changes in refinery operations supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3498 million  in 2017  or 35  of revenue compared to 3170 million  in 2016  or 34  of revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2017  approximately 9 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers at current consumption levels a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for future years these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows approximately 77  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper 

historically to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2017  we entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted occ sales at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 20 million  and 20 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection transfer station and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services including the operation of landfills cng fueling stations a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions are part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these regulations may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 83 billion  in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 24  of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we contribute to 25  multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 19  of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of the five pillars of our strategy is to grow through enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use information technology including computer and information networks in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information while we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

legal proceedings 

tableend general legal proceedings 

we are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements in the normal course of our business we become involved in legal proceedings some may result in fines penalties or judgments against us which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as used herein the term legal proceedings  refers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries excluding 1 ordinary course accidents general commercial liability and workers compensation claims which are covered by insurance programs subject to customary deductibles and which together with selfinsured employee health care costs are discussed in note 7 other liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k and 2 environmental remediation liabilities which are discussed in note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k  

we accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable we have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately 44 million  relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of december 31 2017  as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our legal proceedings and where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range if we had used the high ends of such ranges our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 44 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2017

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in item 8 of this form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue as of december 31 2017  we operated in 40  states and puerto rico through 343  collection operations 204  transfer stations 195  active landfills 90  recycling centers 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 11  salt water disposal wells we also operated 68  landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had 124  closed landfills 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  increased by 70  to 100415 million  compared to 93877 million  in 2016  this change in revenue is due to increases in total price including fuel recovery fees of 29  volume of 18  acquisitions net of divestitures of 08  recycled commodities of 09  and energy services of 06  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 12821 million  9659 million  and 11959 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 12784 million  or 377  per diluted share for 2017  compared to 6126 million  or 178  per diluted share for 2016  and 7499 million  or 213  per diluted share for 2015  

during each of 2017  2016  and 2015  we recorded a number of charges other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ cost of operations ” “ selling general and administrative expenses ” and “ income taxes ” discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings 

  

1 the aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than 001 for the year ended december 31 2017 

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods although our business regularly incurs startup costs under municipal contracts we specifically identify in the table above the startup costs with respect to an individual municipal contract and do not adjust for other startup costs under other contracts in 2017 we do this because of the magnitude of the costs involved with this particular municipal contract and the unusual nature for the time period in which they are incurred in the case of the bridgeton insurance recovery we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often incur recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results we are adjusting for the impact associated with our adoption of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act due to the significant decrease in the federal corporate tax rate and the magnitude of the effect on our operating results our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds   during 2017  we recorded charges to earnings of 12 million  for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute during 2016  and 2015  we recorded charges to earnings of 56 million  and 45 million  respectively for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute related to our operations in puerto rico 

restructuring charges in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters these changes included reducing administrative staffing levels relocating office space and closing certain office locations the savings realized from the realignment were reinvested in our customerfocused programs and initiatives additionally in the second quarter of 2016 we began the redesign of our backoffice functions as well as the consolidation of over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers 

during 2017  and 2016  we incurred 176 million  and 407 million  of restructuring charges respectively that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms 

in january 2018 we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select back office functions including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and closing of certain office locations in 2018 we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately 25 million to 30 million primarily related to employee severance costs lease exit and contract termination costs and the relocation of certain employees we expect annual savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment 

loss on extinguishment of debt   in the fourth quarter of 2017  we retired 867 million of 525 taxexempt bonds due june 2023 resulting in a noncash charge for deferred issuance costs of 08 million during 2016  we priced cash tender offers to purchase 5754 million of outstanding notes and debentures with coupons ranging from 57 to 74 the existing notes additionally we issued 5000 million of 290 senior notes due 2026 the 290 notes and used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase the 5754 million of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes we also used the net proceeds to pay a premium due of 1481 million and early tender consideration of 287 million 

gain loss on business divestitures and impairments net   during 2017 we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and asset impairments related to business divestitures of 271 million  we also recorded a net gain on business divestitures and asset impairments of 68 million  due to the transfer of ownership of the landfill gas collection and control system and the remaining postclosure and environmental liabilities associated with one of our divested landfills during 2016 we recorded a charge to earnings of 46 million primarily related to environmental costs associated with one of our divested landfills during 2016 we also recorded a net gain related to a business divestiture of 47 million 

incremental contract startup costs  large municipal contract during   2017   we incurred direct and incremental costs of 82 million  related to the implementation of a large municipal contract 

adoption of the tax act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 among other things the tax act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 accordingly we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future however we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances the provisional amount recorded at december 31 2017 reduced our tax provision by 4639 million  primarily due to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities 

bridgeton insurance recovery  during 2015  we collected an insurance recovery of 500 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations 

recent developments 

2018 financial guidance 

in 2018  we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returns to our shareholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2018  specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2018  revenue to increase by approximately 40 to 45  comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue the majority of these restricted pricing arrangements are tied to fluctuations in a specific index primarily a consumer price index as defined in the contract the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial effect of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2018  compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017  adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap 



the 2018  anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 27 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds restructuring charges loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on business divestitures and impairments net incremental contract startup costs and the impact of the tax act provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

property and equipment net 

in 2018  we anticipate receiving approximately 11 billion of property and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station landfill disposal recycling and energy services our residential and smallcontainer collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer and largecontainer collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from energy services consists mainly of fees we charge for the treatment and disposal of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 26 23 and 26 for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 43 37 and 40 for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

revenue – 2017  compared to 2016 

during 2017  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2016  

 changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 20 million  and 20 million  respectively 

 revenue – 2016  compared to 2015 

during 2016  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2015  



 cost of operations

cost of operations  2017  compared to 2016 

our cost of operations increased for 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of the following 



 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 

 cost of operations – 2016  compared to 2015 

our cost of operations increased for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of the following 



 depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2017  compared to 2016 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased  in aggregate dollars primarily due to an increase in the cost of replacement vehicles increased trucks to support volume growth additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased  primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion and amortization rate in addition we recognized favorable amortization adjustments related to our asset retirement obligations in 2016 that did not recur in 2017 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2016  compared to 2015 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles increased trucks to support volume growth additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion and amortization rate the increase in expense was partially offset by favorable amortization adjustments recorded during 2016  of 65 million  relative to asset retirement obligations compared to favorable amortization adjustments of 07 million during 2015  

amortization of other intangible assets and other assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets and other assets were 710 million  713 million  and 719 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively or 07  of revenue for 2017  and 08  for 2016  and 2015  our other intangible assets and other assets primarily relate to customer relationships franchise agreements other municipal agreements and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements and trade names the changes in amortization expense are the result of assets acquired in the acquisitions of various waste businesses throughout the year offset by certain intangible assets now being fully amortized 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 798 million  791 million  and 794 million  or 08  of revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  and 09  of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2017  compared to 2016 

salaries increased  primarily due to higher incentive pay and wages and other payroll related items resulting from merit increases 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due a favorable legal settlement during 2016 additionally we had an increase in acquisitionrelated transaction costs associated with our increased acquisition activity during the year 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2016  compared to 2015 

salaries increased primarily due to higher wages benefits and other payroll related items resulting from merit increases and increased headcount 

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily due to a reduction in acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisition of tervita in february 2015 that did not recur in 2016 and favorable legal settlements 

withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds 

during 2017  we recorded charges to earnings of 12 million  for withdrawal events at one of our multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute as we obtain updated information regarding the multiemployer pension plan the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liability will be subject to change which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs 

during 2016  and 2015  we recorded charges to earnings of 56 million and 41 million respectively for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute related to our operations in puerto rico during 2015 we also recorded 04 million of legal charges

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets asset or business divestitures could result in gains losses or asset impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

restructuring charges

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters these changes included reducing administrative staffing levels relocating office space and closing certain office locations the savings realized from these restructuring efforts were reinvested in our customerfocused programs and initiatives additionally in the second quarter of 2016 we began the redesign of our backoffice functions as well as the consolidation of over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers 

during 2016  we incurred 407 million  of restructuring charges that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms we paid 325 million related to these restructuring efforts 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 



total interest expense for 2017  decreased primarily due to the issuance of 5000 million of 290 senior notes in july 2016 that were used to purchase outstanding notes and debentures with coupons ranging from 570 to 740 as a result of the debt that was extinguished in 2016 total interest expense for 2016 increased primarily due to 72 million of unamortized cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings as noncash interest expense 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million and resulted in a 48 million  reduction in interest expense during 2017  compared to a 63 million  reduction in interest expense during 2016  and a 75 million  reduction in interest expense during 2015  

during 2017  2016  and 2015  cash paid for interest was 3269 million  3302 million  and 3276 million  respectively

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 31 million  3527 million  and 4455 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our effective income tax rate was 02  365  and 373  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we made income tax payments net of refunds received of approximately 370 million  265 million  and 321 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 limits deductions for among other things interest expense executive compensation and meals and entertainment while enhancing deductions for equipment and other fixed assets the tax act also requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as of december 31 2017 we have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax act however we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances uncertain tax positions and the onetime transition tax in the aggregate the provisional amounts recorded at december 31 2017 reduced our tax provision by approximately 464 million we anticipate that the completion of our 2017 income tax returns future guidance and additional information and interpretations with respect to the tax act will cause us to further adjust the provisional amounts recorded as of december 31 2017 

outside of the impact of the tax act our 2017 tax provision was reduced by approximately 9 million  due to the realization of tax credits and lower state tax rates due to changes in estimates following the completion of our 2016 tax returns and the favorable resolution of various state tax matters during 2017 these benefits were partially offset by the writeoff of goodwill associated with divestitures that had no corresponding tax basis 

we reduced our 2017 tax provision by 196 million  due to excess tax benefits required to be recorded to the income statement resulting from the adoption of the financial accounting standards boards fasb asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 prior to 2017 these benefits were recorded directly to shareholders’ equity 

in addition during 2017 we acquired noncontrolling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code our 2017 tax provision was reduced by approximately 13 million  mainly due to the tax credits related to these investments we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investments in “ loss from unconsolidated equity method investments ” within our consolidated statements of income for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting see note 3 business acquisitions investments and restructuring charges  included herein 

our 2016 tax provision was reduced by approximately 13 million  due to the resolution of various state and federal tax matters as well as the realization of tax credits and lower state tax rates due to changes in estimates 

in addition during 2016 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to construct a solar energy asset that qualified for an investment tax credit under section 48 of the internal revenue code our 2016 tax provision was reduced by approximately 10 million  primarily due to the tax credit related to this investment 

our 2015 tax provision was reduced by approximately 17 million due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in various states and puerto rico

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2017  compared to 2016  and 2016  compared to 2015  are discussed below 

2017  compared to 2016   

group 1 

revenue for 2017   increased   63  from 2016  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all lines of business additionally we recognized increased recycled commodity revenue due to the increase in commodity prices 

operating income for group 1 increased  from 8955 million  for 2016  or a 214  operating margin to 9407 million  for 2017  or a 211  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

 group 2 

revenue for 2017   increased   66  from 2016  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer collection and disposal lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes these increases were partially offset by volume declines primarily in our residential collection and smallcontainer collection lines of business 

operating income in group 2 increased  from 10269 million  or a 205  operating margin to 11402 million  or a 213  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income margin 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased  from 3849 million  for 2016  to 4124 million  for 2017  the operating loss for 2017 was favorably impacted by a decrease in restructuring charges of 231 million from the same period in 2016 and gain on disposition of businesses offsetting these favorable items were increases in salaries and related benefits due to certain employees relocating from our field operations to our corporate segment as a result of our restructuring increased hourly and salaried wages as a result of merit increases increased facility costs as a result of our restructuring as well as unfavorable actuarial developments in certain of our insurance programs additionally we had favorable legal settlements in 2016 that did not recur in 2017 

2016  compared to 2015   

group 1 

revenue for 2016   increased   40  from 2015  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all lines of business additionally we recognized increased recycled commodity revenue due to the increase in commodity prices 

operating income for group 1 increased  from 8572 million  for 2015  or a 213  operating margin to 8955 million  for 2016  or a 214  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income 

 group 2 

revenue for 2016   increased   18  from 2015  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer collection and disposal lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes these increases were partially offset by declines in our energy services business as well as volume declines primarily in our residential collection and smallcontainer collection lines of business and special waste volume declines in our landfill line of business 

operating income in group 2 increased  from 9535 million  for 2015  or a 194  operating margin to 10269 million  or a 205  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income 



corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased  from 2519 million  for 2015  to 3849 million  for 2016  primarily due to an insurance recovery of 500 million related to our bridgeton landfill that was recorded during 2015 restructuring charges of 407 million related to our 2016 restructuring and 56 million  for withdrawal events at our multiemployer pension plan in puerto rico during 2016  we also recognized increased risk management expenses primarily due to favorable actuarial developments in our workers compensation program recorded during 2015  that were less favorable for the same period in 2016  as well as unfavorable claims experience in our employeerelated health care benefits programs in 2016  as compared to 2015  partially offsetting these unfavorable items were reduced acquisitionrelated transaction costs for 2016  compared to the costs associated with our acquisition of tervita in february 2015 additionally during 2016  we recognized net favorable legal settlements from matters occurring in the ordinary course of business that were more favorable compared to net legal settlements in 2015 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 







changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or operated 195  active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 50860 million  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2017  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 47357 million  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 3503 million  inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates  section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  eleven  of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these eleven  landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 55 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 63 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2017  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2017  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 12577 million  of which 774 million  were current and 11803 million  were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill during the year ended december 31 2017  we paid 194 million  related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts from time to time this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures which could result in changes to our expected liability as of december 31 2017  the remediation liability recorded for this site was 1773 million  of which 206 million  is expected to be paid during 2018  we believe the remaining reasonably possible highend of our range would be approximately 177 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2017  

during 2015 we collected an insurance recovery of  500 million  related to our bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during the year ended december 31 2015  

west lake landfill superfund site  our subsidiary bridgeton landfill llc together with its subsidiary rock road industries inc is one of several currently designated potentially responsible parties for the west lake landfill superfund site west lake in missouri on february 6 2018 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a proposed record of decision amendment for west lake that includes a total cost estimate of 236 million  over a five year remediation timeline an initial 45 day public comment period follows the announcement and we expect at least one public meeting at this time we are neither able to predict the final remedy that epa may eventually select in its record of decision rod following the comment period nor estimate how much of the future response costs of the site our subsidiary may agree or be required to pay during any subsequent administrative proceedings or litigation our subsidiary will vigorously contest liability for the costs of remediating radiologicallyimpacted materials generated on behalf of the federal government during the manhattan project and delivered to the site by an atomic energy commission licensee and its subcontractor currently we believe we are adequately reserved for the rod that was issued in 2008 however issuance of the final rod and subsequent events related to remedy divisibility or allocation may require us to modify our expected remediation liability 

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions 





  

the following tables reflect our future expected investment as of december 31 2017 in millions 



the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 



during 2017 and 2016 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

as of december 31 2017 we expect to spend an estimated additional  91 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  127 billion  or  251  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions of dollars 













liquidity and capital resources 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2017  2016  and 2015  are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2017  and 2016  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased  our cash flow from operations by 2309 million  in 2017  compared to a decrease  of 2052 million  in 2016  primarily as a result of the following 

 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 370 million  and 265 million  for 2017  and 2016  respectively income taxes paid in 2017 reflect the passage of the tax act which provided for 100 equipment expensing on qualified assets placed in service after september 27 2017 and the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act which provided for bonus depreciation deductions on assets placed in service in 2017 at 50  of the capitalized value income taxes paid in 2016 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 cash paid for interest was 3269 million  and 3302 million  for 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2016  and 2015  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decrease d our cash flow from operations by 2052 million  in 2016  compared to a decrease  of 3167 million  in 2015  primarily as a result of the following 



in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 265 million  and 321 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively income taxes paid in 2016 and 2015 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 as well as the realization of certain tax credits cash paid for interest was 3302 million  and 3276 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2017  2016  and 2015  are summarized below 

 we received 500 million in connection with issuances of taxexempt bonds during 2017  funds received from issuances of taxexempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures or for repayments of the related taxexempt bonds are presented as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows such reimbursements amounted to 114 million 21 million and 187 million during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2017  2016  and 2015  are summarized below 



financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2017  we had 833 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 1411 million  of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 286 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 714 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

credit facilities 

in may 2016 we entered into a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the replacement credit facility which replaced our 10 billion  credit facility that would have matured in may 2017 the replacement credit facility matures in may 2021 and includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount up to 5000 million  through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the replacement credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the replacement credit facility 

contemporaneous with the execution of the replacement credit facility we entered into amendment no 1 to our existing 125 billion  unsecured credit facility the existing credit facility and together with the replacement credit facility the credit facilities to conform certain terms of the existing credit facility with those of the replacement credit facility amendment no 1 does not extend the maturity date of the existing credit facility which matures in june 2019 the existing credit facility also maintains the feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 5000 million  through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 

the credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends and repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2017  our ebitda to interest ratio was 771 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 296 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2018 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

availability under our credit facilities totaled 16391 million  and 15431 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 1300 million  and 2100 million  of borrowings under our credit facilities respectively we had 4627 million  and  4784 million  of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

during 2016 we amended our existing unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility to increase the size to 1350 million  with all other terms remaining unchanged our uncommitted credit facility bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin and is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had no  borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2017  we issued 6500 million  of 3375  notes due 2027 the 3375  notes we used the net proceeds from the 3375  notes to repay amounts borrowed under our credit facilities 

during 2016 we priced cash tender offers to purchase up to 5754 million  combined aggregate principal amount of the 620  notes due march 2040 570  notes due may 2041 740  debentures due september 2035 and 609  notes due march 2035 collectively the existing notes subject to priority levels and the other terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase during 2016 we priced an offering of 5000 million  of 290  senior notes due 2026 the 290  notes the sale of the 290  notes and the tender offers closed on july 5 2016 we used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase 5754 million  of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes tendered as well as premium due of 1481 million  and early tender consideration of 287 million  

during 2015 we issued 5000 million  of 320  notes due 2025 the 320  notes we used the net proceeds from the 320  notes to refinance debt incurred in connection with our acquisition of all of the equity interests of tervita during 2015 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 69130 million and 62677 million respectively of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2041 our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations 

interest rate swap and lock agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2017  these swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million  and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized 48 million  63 million  and 75 million  respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

during 2017 we entered into interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 2170 to 2418 to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned future issuance of senior notes during 2016 we also entered into a number of interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900  to 2280  upon the expected issuance of senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties the aggregate fair values of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31 2017  and 2016  were 191 million  and 202 million  respectively and were recorded in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets total loss gain recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax for interest rate locks was 07 million  and 122 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively no amount was recognized in other comprehensive income for 2015 

taxexempt financings 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we retired 867 million  of 525  taxexempt bonds in advance of the maturity date additionally the california pollution control financing authority cpcfa adopted a resolution approving the issuance and sale of up to 1000 million  of solid waste disposal revenue bonds for the benefit of republic under which cpcfa issued 500 million  of variablerate taxexempt debt on our behalf the proceeds from the issuance will be used to fund qualifying landfillrelated capital expenditures in the state of california as of december 31 2017  we had  1411 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 386 million  represented proceeds from the issuance of the taxexempt bonds 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 10360 million  and 10727 million  respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019  to 2044  approximately 98  of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as longterm because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

intended uses of cash 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2017  see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair value of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2017  was an asset of 30 million and has been recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016  the aggregated fair value of our outstanding fuel hedges was a liability of 27 million and has been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

total gain loss recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax for fuel hedges the effective portion was 34 million  207 million  and 20 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

during 2017  and 2016  approximately 10 and 20 respectively of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated containers occ and old newsprint from time to time we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities during 2016  we entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ sales the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales commodity hedges for further discussion see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair values of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2017  and 2016  were current liabilities of 02 million  and 08 million respectively and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

total gain loss recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax for recycling commodity hedges the effective portion was 04 million  and 05 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively no  amount was recognized in other comprehensive income for 2015 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2017  for variable rate debt the effect of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2017  

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2017  and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2018  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table calculates our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions of dollars 



for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow see our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and  cash flows used in investing activities  contained elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures the following table reconciles property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in millions of dollars 



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that presenting free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine executive compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 



permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 17 in 2017 18 in 2016 and 20 in 2015 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 43 in 2017 375 in 2016 and 475 in 2015 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 



 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 



environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

 insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million  to 75 millio n the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 

residual risks 



loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1st or when an indicator of impairment exists as of october 1 2017 we early adopted accounting standards update “asu” 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  “asu 201704” asu 201704 eliminated step 2 of the goodwill impairment test in which an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities in accordance with the new standard we compare the fair value of our reporting units with the carrying value including goodwill we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value as applicable 

during 2017 we managed and evaluated our operations through two field groups group 1 and group 2 in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to be approximately 3  annually 2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 27  3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7  and 8  and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 we conclude that we may not recover a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our two  reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of october 1 2017 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control 

as of october 1 2017 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 90  on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

 income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred taxes and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 when it is not more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 

residual risks 

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the benefits of all current plan participants are frozen 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our employee benefits committee as of december 31 2017  the plan assets were invested in fixed income funds equity funds and cash the employee benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary as of december 31 2017  and 2016 the plan was overfunded by 141 million  and 62 million  respectively 

residual risk 

 assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates mortality rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 19 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 22 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned there are no participants in the plan that continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement”   



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 943 million  additionally during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2017  our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

during 2017  we entered into interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 3000 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 2170  to 2418  during 2016 we also entered into a number of interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900  to 2280  to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned future issuance of senior notes upon the expected issuance of the senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties 

as of december 31 2017  we had 11473 million  of floating rate debt and 3000 million  of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 15 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3498 million  in 2017  or 35  of revenue compared to 3170 million  in 2016  or 34  of revenue and 3624 million  in 2015  or 40  of revenue 

for additional discussion and detail of our fuel hedges see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling centers market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 20 million  and 20 million  respectively 

revenue from sales of these products in 2017  2016  and 2015  was 5392 million  4204 million  and 3720 million  respectively

business 

tableend overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2016  we operated in 39 states and puerto rico through 333  collection operations 204  transfer stations 192  active landfills 64  recycling centers 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 10  salt water disposal wells we also operated 71 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 124  closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

based on an industry trade publication the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 60 billion of which approximately 45 is generated by publicly owned waste companies industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous solid waste services industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35 and 20 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to population growth and growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

the five pillars of our strategy  profitable growth through differentiation 

we believe that our products and services are valuable and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation   is built on five key pillars including 1 market position 2 operating model 3 people and talent agenda 4 customer zeal and 5 digital platform 

market position 

the goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts market changes and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 



 external growth 

 we continue to invest in accretive acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 100 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allow us to reduce capital and expense requirements associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent high quality service to all of our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business 

a key enabler of the republic way is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360 degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient and environmentally sound way 

fleet automation 

approximately 74 of our residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng   

approximately 18 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng our preferred alternative fuel technology as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 36 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2016  were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront capital costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2016  we operated 38 cng fueling stations 

standardized maintenance   

based on an industry trade publication we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2016  our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs we have implemented standardized maintenance programs for approximately 92 of our fleet maintenance operations as of december 31 2016  we expect the entire fleet will be certified under onefleet by the second quarter of 2017 

organizational structure 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters following our restructuring our senior management now evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western and portions of the midwestern united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in texas the southeastern and portions of the midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states each field group is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our field groups and all of our areas provide collection transfer recycling and landfill services see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments

learning and talent development 

we are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers targeted onboarding experiences including our driver training center supervisor onboarding and sales acceleration programs focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role our leadership trainee program an 18month rotational experience for recent college graduates is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth 

developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda from leadership fundamentals a program for new front line supervisors to our leadership trainee and general manager acceleration program for early career leaders we have developed programs and experiences to help ensure that as our leaders progress they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level over the last two years more than 2000 leaders have completed our leadership fundamentals program creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees 

diversity and inclusion 

we are actively and intentionally creating an environment in which all individuals are welcomed and valued in 2013 we launched mosaic as our renewed approach and commitment to diversity and inclusion through mosaic we have developed new strategies and activities to continue creating a more diverse workforce and inclusive work environment in this way we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers 

we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2016 for example 22 of general managers 25 of operations managers and 27 of maintenance managers that we hired selfidentified as having served in the us army navy marines air force or coast guard 

customer zeal 

the goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs we believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service 

to help our sales team with their ability to identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering we use a priority based selling pbs technique and our capture pricing tool nationwide 

 in response to our customers’ requests we expanded our suite of products to include electronics recycling with blueguard tm  universal recycling and allinone office for those services that we don’t provide we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship 

to help ensure a consistent customer experience we invested in our customer service capabilities and have made continued progress on the consolidation of our over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the new stateoftheart facilities and the technology deployed provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service across a myriad of touch points including voice email text social media channels and live chat the stateoftheart centers enhance the customer experience and will lower the company’s cost structure once the transition is complete by the end of 2017 

to help ensure our efforts are making an impact and building customer loyalty we also have enhanced the way we receive feedback from our customers including net promoter score so that every general manager receives recent relevant feedback that allows him or her the ability to reach out to customers directly and address issues immediately 

digital platform 

the goal of our digital platform pillar is to allow us to provide a consistent experience across our business while enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information 

we are responding to our customers requests for options to do business with us digitally by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our webbased market presence we believe we enhance customer satisfaction interaction and connectivity while lowering our costs these tools reinforce to our customers that they can rely on us to handle their recycling and waste service needs in a way that is easy and convenient for them 

 we believe that leveraging technology to improve our core business strengthens our existing model and customer relationships and will serve to solidify our differentiated offering 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

in addition to being committed to our customers and employees we are also committed to the communities we serve and to the environment we strive to be america’s preferred recycling and waste services partner at republic we believe in the preservation of our blue planet  a cleaner safer and healthier world 

we believe we have a responsibility to regenerate our planet with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day by driving increased recycling generating renewable energy and helping our customers be more resourceful additionally we must lead by example working diligently to improve our relationship with the environment and society through decreased vehicle emissions innovative landfill technologies use of renewable energy community engagement and employee growth opportunities sustainability contributes to a cleaner world while also providing opportunities to improve brand awareness to increase customer loyalty to grow our business to motivate our employees and to differentiate republic from our competitors 

to maximize our efforts we have chosen to focus our sustainability platform around the following five areas 

 each of these areas has a significant effect on the environment and society and contributes to preserving our blue planet while forming the foundation of our business going forward we have developed programs that will enable us to reduce our emissions by 25 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2018 including developing at least two landfill gastoenergy projects each year adding at least 150000 tons per year of recycling capacity and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet by 3 by 2018 we added a safety goal in 2016 to reduce our ohsa recordable rates by 7 per year 

we have been steadily building on our sustainability progress and performance we were announced as a cdp climate a list company less than 10 of companies worldwide who participate are named to the climate a list in addition we were inducted into both the north american and world dow jones sustainability indices djsi we believe the djsi is the gold standard for corporate sustainability republic is the only recycling and solid waste collection provider in the commercial services and supplies sector that is included in the 2016 djsi world index these achievements demonstrate our ability to connect financial performance with environmental and social performance the rankings also highlight republics leadership in corporate governance environmental social and financial aspects of sustainability finally we released our second sustainability report that follows the gri g4 protocol which is available on our website at wwwrepublicservicescom 

republic is one of the few fortune 500 companies whose board has a sustainability and corporate responsibility committee this committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance our corporate responsibilities our 

role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risk including cyber security environmental and reputational risks 

cash utilization strategy 

we believe our ability to consistently increase free cash flow drives shareholder value and provides confirmation regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes investments in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa3 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2016  such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2016  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 032 per share which represents an increase of approximately 7 over the prior year over the last five years our dividend has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 78 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2015  our board of directors added 900 million  to the existing share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2016  there was 4517 million  remaining under our share repurchase authorization at least annually our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock during 2017  we expect to use all our remaining authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock 

shareholder value 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management we have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters including governance and executive compensation 

management team 

we believe we have one of the most experienced management teams in the solid waste industry 

donald w slager  became our chief executive officer ceo and remained our president on january 1 2011 after having served as our president and chief operating officer coo from the allied waste industries inc allied acquisition in december 2008 until then prior to the allied acquisition mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations mr slager held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 35 years of experience in the solid waste industry mr slager has been a member of our board of directors since june 24 2010

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe republic is a company with a strong national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 68  of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority it is profitable to do so and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste recovering and recycling of certain materials and energy services 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial solid waste collection services through 333  collection operations in 2016  approximately 76  of our total revenue was derived from our collection business of which approximately 24  of our total revenue relates to residential services approximately 31  relates to smallcontainer commercial services and approximately 21  relates to largecontainer industrial services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer commercial business we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our smallcontainer commercial services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer industrial collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer industrial services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality and professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer industrial collection business the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

we also provide recycling collection services tailored to our customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services 

we own or operate 204  transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2016  our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 192  active landfills our tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 12  of our revenue during 2016  as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 37400  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides our economy with benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2016  we operated 71 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

we also have responsibility for 124  closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 64  recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated containers occ old newsprint onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2016  approximately 74  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper of the 50 million tons we sold during 2016  25 million moved through our recycling centers and 25 million we collected and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to purchase materials from municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

energy services 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 10  salt water disposal wells energy services waste is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity including waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well production wastes and water produced during a wells operating life contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation and substances that require cleanup after a spill revenue is therefore primarily generated through waste managed from vertical and horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing production and cleanup activity as well as other services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products in 2016  approximately 1  of our revenue was derived from energy services energy services activity varies across market areas that are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publicly owned companies several regional publicly and privately owned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer industrial and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on 

currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements as applicable operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up or protecting against the release of such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the clean water act or the safe drinking water act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities furthermore if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands we may be required to secure permits before such development starts in these situations permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts 

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past three years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks including tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

 state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others 

legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks can be subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs 

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations  section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

risk factors 

tableend this form 10k contains certain forwardlooking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” provided by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are statements that are not historical facts words such as “guidance” “expect” “will” “may” “anticipate” “plan” “estimate” “project” “intend” “should” “can” “likely” “could” “believe” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements about our plans strategies and prospects forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance these statements are based upon our managements current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties including the risks set forth below in these risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied or projected by the forwardlooking information and statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct accordingly you should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this form 10k except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form 10k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or energy services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill from time to time our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs improve our operating margins and earn an adequate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3170 million  in 2016  or 34  of revenue compared to 3624 million  in 2015  or 40  of revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2016  approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers at current consumption levels a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the 

availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for 2017  and beyond these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows approximately 74  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper 

historically to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2016  we entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted occ sales at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material effect to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection transfer station and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure 

to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the business and assets we operate expose us to safety operational and other risks including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties 

the provision of waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services including the operation of landfills cng fueling stations a substantial fleet of trucks and other wasterelated assets involves risks these risks include among others the risk of truck accidents equipment defects malfunctions and failures improper use of dangerous equipment the release of hazardous substances fire and explosion any of which could result in environmental liability personal injury loss of life business interruption or property damage or destruction while we carry insurance to cover many contingencies and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance training and compliance programs any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 on august 16 2016 the epa and the nhtsa issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on july 14 2016 the epa issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action finalized that same day the epa issued updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions are part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these regulations may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility eg generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 77 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs 

associated with lawsuits regulatory governmental and other legal proceedings we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative managerial and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 27  of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse effect on us 

we contribute to 26  multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 20  of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations if any of our key technology fails our business could be adversely affected 

our operations are increasingly dependent on technology our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience one of the five pillars of our strategy is to grow through enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and accordingly we have made substantial investment in our ecommerce platform problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect or temporarily disable all or a portion of our operations inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings additionally any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information while the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies 

resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue as of december 31 2016  we operated in 39  states and puerto rico through 333  collection operations 204  transfer stations 192  active landfills 64  recycling centers 7  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 10  salt water disposal wells we also operated 71  landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 124  closed landfills 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  increased by 30  to 93877 million  compared to 91150 million  in 2015  this change in revenue is due to increases in average yield of 21  volume of 10  acquisitions net of divestitures of 06  and recycled commodities of 05  partially offset by decreases in fuel recovery fees of 08  and energy services of 04  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 9659 million  11959 million  and 8853 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 6126 million  or 178  per diluted share for 2016  compared to 7499 million  or 213  per diluted share for 2015  and 5476 million  or 153  per diluted share for 2014  

during each of 2016  2015  and 2014  we recorded a number of charges other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ cost of operations ” “ selling general and administrative expenses ” and “ income taxes ” discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings 

  



1 the aggregate effect of the noted items to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to 001 for the year ended december 31 2014 

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods in the case of the bridgeton remediation charges and insurance recovery we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often incur remediation charges and recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies

during 2016  we incurred 407 million  of restructuring charges that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms we paid 325 million  related to these restructuring efforts we expect to incur additional charges of approximately 15 million  over the next year related to our field realignment the consolidation of our customer service locations and the redesign of our backoffice functions substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment 

during 2014  we incurred costs of 18 million  due to a change in estimate of amounts recoverable from sublet income associated with abandoned office space with noncancellable lease terms 

loss on extinguishment of debt   during 2016  we priced cash tender offers to purchase 5754 million of outstanding notes and debentures with coupons ranging from 57 to 74 the existing notes additionally we issued 5000 million of 290 senior notes due 2026 the 290 notes and used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase the 5754 million of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes we also used the net proceeds to pay a premium due of 1481 million and early tender consideration of 287 million the tender of the existing notes and sale of the 290 notes closed on july 5 2016 in 2014  we refinanced our credit facilities and certain of our taxexempt financings resulting in noncash charges for deferred issuance costs of 14 million  for a more detailed discussion of

recent developments 

2017 financial guidance 

in 2017  we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returns to our shareholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2017  specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2017  revenue to increase by approximately 45 to 50  comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue of these restricted pricing arrangements 

 the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial effect of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2017 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap 

the 2017 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 395 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes withdrawal costs  multiemployer pension funds restructuring charges loss on extinguishment of debt and gain loss on business dispositions and impairments net provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

property and equipment net 

in 2017  we anticipate receiving approximately 975 million of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment as follows 



results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station landfill disposal recycling and energy services our residential and smallcontainer commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from energy services consists mainly of fees we charge for the treatment of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 23 26 and 15 for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 37 40 and 34 for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

revenue – 2016  compared to 2015 

during 2016  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2015  



 changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

 revenue – 2015  compared to 2014 

during 2015  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2014  

 cost of operations

cost of operations  2016  compared to 2015 

our cost of operations increased for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of the following 

 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 



 cost of operations – 2015  compared to 2014 

excluding the effect of the bridgeton insurance recovery our cost of operations increased for 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of the following

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased  primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles increased trucks to support volume growth additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased  primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion and amortization rate the increase in expense was partially offset by favorable amortization adjustments recorded during 2016  of 65 million  relative to asset retirement obligations compared to favorable amortization adjustments of 07 million  during 2015

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 791 million  794 million  and 780 million  or 08  of revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  and 09  of revenue for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions in millions of dollars 



as a result of the debt that was extinguished in 2016 total interest expense for 2016  increased primarily due to 72 million  of unamortized cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings as noncash interest expense total interest expense increased  during 2015  due to the issuance of 5000 million  of 320  notes in march 2015 as well as borrowings under our credit facilities 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million and resulted in a 63 million  reduction in interest expense during 2016  compared to a 75 million  reduction in interest expense during 2015  and a 77 million  reduction in interest expense during 2014  additionally during 2014 there were lower variable rates on our taxexempt financings which also contributed to the increase in 2015 interest expense

our 2016  tax provision was reduced by approximately 13 million  due to the resolution of various state and federal tax matters as well as the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates 

in addition during 2016 we acquired a noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company that qualifies for a federal investment tax credit under section 48 of the internal revenue code our 2016 tax provision was reduced by approximately 10 million  mostly due to a federal tax credit related to this investment which was recognized currently and not deferred we account for this investment using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investment in “ loss from unconsolidated equity method investment ” within our consolidated statements of income during 2016 we reduced the carrying value of this investment by 61 million  as a result of the tax credits allocated to us cash distributions and our share of income and loss pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement 

our 2015  tax provision was reduced by approximately 17 million  due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in various states and puerto rico our 2014  tax provision was reduced by approximately 5 million  due to the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates 

income taxes paid in 2016 and 2015 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 this legislation extends bonus depreciation for property placed in service through 2019 bonus depreciation deductions for assets placed in service in 2015 to 2017 is 50  of the capitalized value and decreases to 40  in 2018 and 30  in 2019 

income taxes paid in 2014 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the tax increase protection act of 2014 signed into law in december 2014 this legislation extended 50  bonus depreciation for property placed in service during 2014

reportable segments 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining our three regions into two field groups consolidating our areas and streamlining select operational support roles at our phoenix headquarters following our restructuring our senior management now evaluates oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups referred to as group 1 and group 2 group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western and portions of the midwestern united states and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in texas the southeastern and portions of the midwestern united states and the eastern seaboard of the united states 

the two field groups group 1 and group 2 are presented below as our reportable segments which provide integrated waste management services consisting of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer recycling disposal and energy services 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of operating margin 



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2016  compared to 2015  and 2015  compared to 2014  are discussed below 

2016  compared to 2015   

group 1 

revenue for 2016   increased   40  from 2015  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all lines of business additionally we recognized increased recycled commodity revenue due to the increase in commodity prices 

operating income for group 1 increased  from 8572 million  for 2015  or a 213  operating margin to 8955 million  for 2016  or a 214  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income 



group 2 

revenue for 2016   increased   18  from 2015  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer industrial collection and disposal lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and municipal solid waste volumes these increases were partially offset by declines in our energy services business as well as volume declines primarily in our residential collection and smallcontainer commercial collection lines of business and special waste volume declines in our landfill line of business 

operating income in group 2 increased  from 9535 million  or a 194  operating margin to 10269 million  or a 205  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased  from 2519 million  for 2015  to 3849 million  for 2016  primarily due to an insurance recovery of 500 million related to our bridgeton landfill that was recorded during 2015  restructuring charges of 407 million  related to our 2016 restructuring and 56 million  for withdrawal events at our multiemployer pension plan in puerto rico during 2016  we also recognized increased risk management expenses primarily due to favorable actuarial developments in our workers compensation program recorded during 2015  that were less favorable for the same period in 2016  as well as unfavorable claims experience in our employeerelated health care benefits programs in 2016  as compared to 2015  partially offsetting these unfavorable items were reduced acquisitionrelated transaction costs for 2016  compared to the costs associated with our acquisition of tervita in february 2015 additionally during 2016  we recognized net favorable legal settlements from matters occurring in the ordinary course of business that were more favorable compared to net legal settlements in 2015 

2015  compared to 2014   

group 1 

revenue for 2015   increased   50  from 2014  primarily due to acquisitions including a waste management contract with the county of sonoma california that was executed in april 2015 excluding the effect of acquisitions revenue increased due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all collection lines of business additionally revenue increased due to volume increases in our landfill municipal solid waste and construction and demolition lines of business partially offsetting these revenue increases was lower recycled commodity revenue due to the decline in commodity prices 

operating income in group 1 increased  from 8260 million  for 2014  or a 215  operating margin to 8572 million  for 2015  or a 213  operating margin the following cost categories impacted our operating income 



group 2 

revenue for 2015   increased   28  from 2014  primarily due to acquisitions excluding the effect of acquisitions revenue increased due to increases in average yield in all collection lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer industrial and residential collection and transfer station lines of business these increases were partially offset by declines in volume in our landfill line of business resulting from lower base energy services waste volumes additionally we recognized lower recycled commodity revenue due to the decline in commodity prices 

operating income in group 2 increased  from 9386 million  for 2014  or a 196  operating margin to 9535 million  for 2015 or a 194  operating margin overall our operating margins were unfavorably impacted due to the effect of commodity prices on our recycling business and higher integration transition and operating costs in our acquired energy services business 

the following cost categories impacted our operating income 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities decreased  from 5315 million  for 2014  to 2519 million  for 2015  primarily due to an insurance recovery of 500 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2015 compared to unfavorable remediation and litigation adjustments in 2014 of 2271 million  

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 







changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or operated 192  active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 49944 million  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2016  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 47076 million  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2868 million  inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates  section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  thirteen  of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these thirteen  landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 44 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 64 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2016  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2016  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 12246 million  of which 648 million  were current and 11598 million  were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill during the year ended december 31 2016  we paid 230 million  related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts from time to time this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures which could result in changes to our expected liability as of december 31 2016  the remediation liability recorded for this site is 1972 million  of which 264 million  is expected to be paid during 2017  we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately 156 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2016  

during 2015 we collected an insurance recovery of 500 million  related to our bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during the year ended december 31 2015  

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2016 in millions 





  



the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 



during 2016 and 2015 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

as of december 31 2016 we expect to spend an estimated additional  86 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  122 billion  or  244  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 in millions of dollars 













liquidity and capital resources 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2016  2015  and 2014  are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2016  and 2015  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased  our cash flow from operations by 2052 million  in 2016  compared to a decrease  of 3167 million  in 2015  primarily as a result of the following 

 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 265 million  and 321 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively income taxes paid in 2016 and 2015 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 as well as the realization of certain tax credits cash paid for interest was 3302 million  and 3276 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2015  and 2014  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decrease d our cash flow from operations by 3167 million  in 2015  compared to a decrease  of 2956 million  in 2014  primarily as a result of the following 



 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 321 million  and 382 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively income taxes paid in 2015 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 cash paid for interest was 3276 million  and 3202 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2016  2015  and 2014  are summarized below 

 we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2016  2015  and 2014  are summarized below 



financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2016  we had 678 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 905 million  of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 279 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 626 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

credit facilities 

in may 2016 we entered into a 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the replacement credit facility which replaced our 10 billion  credit facility maturing in may 2017 the replacement credit facility matures in may 2021 and includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount up to 5000 million  through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the replacement credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 

contemporaneous with the execution of the replacement credit facility we entered into amendment no 1 to our existing 125 billion  unsecured credit facility the existing credit facility and together with the replacement credit facility the credit facilities to conform certain terms of the existing credit facility with those of the replacement credit facility amendment no 1 does not extend the maturity date of the existing credit facility which matures in june 2019 the existing credit facility also maintains the feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 5000 million  through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 

the credit agreements require us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends and repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2016  our ebitda to interest ratio was 705 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 296 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2017 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

availability under our credit facilities totaled 15431 million  and 17277 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 2100 million  and no borrowings under our credit facilities 

respectively we had 4784 million  and  5033 million  of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

during 2016  we amended our existing unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility to increase the size to 1350 million  with all other terms remaining unchanged our uncommitted credit facility bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin and is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2016  we had no borrowings and as of december 31 2015  we had 190 million  of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2016  we priced cash tender offers to purchase up to 5754 million  combined aggregate principal amount of the 620  notes due march 2040 570  notes due may 2041 740  debentures due september 2035 and 609  notes due march 2035 collectively the existing notes subject to priority levels and the other terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase during 2016  we priced an offering of 5000 million  of 290  senior notes due 2026 the 290  notes the sale of the 290  notes and the tender offers closed on july 5 2016 we used the net proceeds of the offering together with borrowing under our credit facilities to purchase 5754 million  of the combined aggregate principal amount of the existing notes tendered as well as premium due of 1481 million  and early tender consideration of 287 million  

during 2015  we issued 5000 million  of 320  notes due 2025 the 320  notes we used the net proceeds from the 320  notes to refinance debt incurred in connection with our acquisition of all of the equity interests of tervita during 2015  

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 62677 million and 63303 million respectively of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2041 our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations 

interest rate swap and lock agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2016  these swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized 63 million  75 million  and 77 million  respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

during 2016 we entered into a number of interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900  to 2280  to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned future issuance of senior notes upon the expected issuance of senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31 2016  was 202 million  and was recorded in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  the effective portion of the interest rate locks recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax was 122 million  

during 2015 we entered into a number of interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 2000 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 2155  to 2270  to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of the planned issuance of the 320  notes upon issuance of the 320  notes we terminated the interest rate locks and received 12 million  from the counterparties 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had 10727 million  and 10721 million  respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2044 approximately 90 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as longterm because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

intended uses of cash 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from 

our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2016  see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were current liabilities of 27 million  and 378 million  respectively and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2016  and 2015  net of tax of 16 million and 223 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

during 2016  and 2015  approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated containers and old newsprint from time to time we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities during 2016  we entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ sales the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales commodity hedges for further discussion see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair value of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2016  was a current liability of 08 million  and has been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

the effective portion of the changes in fair value as of december 31 2016  net of tax of 05 million  has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2016  for variable rate debt the effect of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2016  

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2016  and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2017  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table calculates our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions of dollars   

for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow see our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities  contained elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures the following table reconciles property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in millions of dollars 



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that presenting free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine executive compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  note 10 income taxes  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 18 in 2016 20 in 2015 and 23 in 2014 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 375 in 2016 475 in 2015 and 45 in 2014 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 



after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

 environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

 insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance policies for workers compensation commercial general liability commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible or retention programs the deductibles or retentions range from 3 million to 75 million the employeerelated health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 

residual risks 

 loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually or when an indicator of impairment exists during 2015 we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for our reporting units to october 1 st  this voluntary change in the annual goodwill testing date is a change in accounting principle which we believe is preferable as it better aligns the timing of the assessment with our planning and forecasting process and also provides additional time to complete our annual assessment in advance of our yearend reporting this change in assessment date was applied prospectively and did not delay accelerate or avoid a potential impairment charge 

we test goodwill for impairment using a twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

during 2016 we managed and evaluated our operations through two field groups group 1 and group 2 in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 3  to 5  2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40  3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7  and 8  and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of october 1 2016 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control 

as of october 1 2016 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 80  on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

 income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred taxes and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future deferred tax 

assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 when it is not more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 

we consider the earnings from our puerto rican subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis that the earnings from our puerto rican subsidiaries are reinvested in operating our puerto rican subsidiaries we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and puerto rican withholding taxes on approximately 48 million of undistributed earnings from our puerto rican subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states if we decide to repatriate the puerto rican earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 

residual risks 

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the benefits of all current plan participants are frozen 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our employee benefits committee as of december 31 2016  the plan assets were invested in fixed income funds equity funds and cash the employee benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary as of december 31 2016  and 2015 the plan was overfunded by 62 million  and underfunded by 54 million  respectively 

residual risk 

 assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates mortality rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 21 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 25 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned there are no participants in the plan that continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement”   



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling 896 million  additionally during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2016  our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

during 2016 we also entered into a number of interest rate lock agreements having an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million  with fixed interest rates ranging from 1900  to 2280  to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned future issuance of senior notes upon the expected issuance of senior notes we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties 

as of december 31 2016  we had 11773 million  of floating rate debt and 3000 million  of floating interest rate swap contracts if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately 15 million this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy see note 9 debt  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent  per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3170 million  in 2016  or 34  of revenue compared to 3624 million  in 2015  or 40  of revenue and 5000 million  in 2014  or 57  of revenue 

for additional discussion and detail of our fuel hedges see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling centers market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10  per 

ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

revenue from sales of these products in 2016  2015  and 2014  was 4204 million  3720 million  and 4058 million  respectively

business 

tableend overview 

republic is the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer disposal recycling and energy services in the united states as measured by revenue as of december 31 2015  we operated in 41 states and puerto rico through 340  collection operations 201  transfer stations 193  active landfills 67  recycling centers 8  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 12  salt water disposal wells we also operated 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 126  closed landfills we were incorporated in delaware in 1996 

based on an industry trade publication the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 60 billion of which approximately 45 is generated by publicly owned waste companies industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous solid waste services industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35 and 20 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to population growth and growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

the five pillars of our strategy  profitable growth through differentiation 

we believe that our products and services are valuable and that by developing a superior team and delivering superior products we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors differentiation allows us to attract and retain the best talent win more customers increase loyalty and ultimately drive higher revenue and profits our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation   is built on five key pillars including 1 market position 2 operating model 3 people and talent agenda 4 customer zeal and 5 digital platform 

market position 

the goal of our market position pillar is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

we have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships additionally our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge including the effects of demographic shifts market changes and the competitive landscape 

internal growth 

 2 

 external growth 

 we continue to invest in accretive acquisitions in existing markets generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 100 million annually given our free cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we have the flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on growth through publicprivate partnerships which include the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments we believe we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

we realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships which allow us to reduce capital and expense requirements associated with truck routing personnel fleet maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

operating model 

the goal of our operating model pillar is to deliver a consistent high quality service to all of our customers through the republic way one way everywhere every day  this approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence the republic way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business 

a key enabler of the republic way is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360 degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with general management supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise this structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics 

we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient and environmentally sound way 

fleet automation 

approximately 72 of our residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng   

approximately 16 of our fleet operates on cng we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng our preferred alternative fuel technology as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 33 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2015  were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront costs are higher using cng reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses as of december 31 2015  we operated 38 cng fueling stations 

standardized maintenance   

based on an industry trade publication we operate the ninth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2015  our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



onefleet our standardized vehicle maintenance program enables us to use best practices for fleet management truck care and maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet by one year we believe operating a more reliable greener safer and more efficient fleet will lower our operating costs we have implemented standardized maintenance programs for approximately 78 of our fleet maintenance operations as of december 31 2015  we expect to finish implementing our standardized maintenance program in 2016 

organizational structure 

during 2015 we managed and evaluated our operations through three geographic regions  east central and west  which we identified as our reportable segments each region was organized into several areas and each area contained multiple business units or operating locations each of our regions and all of our areas provided collection transfer recycling and landfill services see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining two organizational layers into one this included the elimination of our three regions the consolidation of our 20 areas into 10 and the streamlining of select roles at our phoenix headquarters we will reinvest and deploy resources into our areas by creating 10 area offices equipped with enhanced teams of operators and functional support roles these area teams will be the resource epicenter for the company’s business units that are closest to and serve our customers the areas will be grouped and overseen by two executive vice presidents of operations in connection with our restructuring we will further evaluate our 2016 reporting segments 

people and talent agenda 

the goal of our people and talent agenda pillar is to create an environment to attract and retain the best talent our people continue to be the most critical component in successfully executing our strategy we strive to make republic a desirable place to work for our approximately 33000 fulltime employees by creating learning experiences programs compensation and benefits that attract develop train engage motivate reward and retain the best workforce we aspire to be a company where the best people want to work and are engaged every day we accomplish this through our focus on safety learning and talent development and diversity and inclusion 

safety   

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve due to the nature of our industry we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 8 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 42 better than the industry average our think choose live  slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think  about what you are doing choose  the safe answer and live  to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition that they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

we are proud of our two safety incentive programs dedicated to safety and dedicated to excellence for dedicated to safety employees must meet all safety requirements for the year including no preventable accidents and no safety warnings for dedicated to excellence employees must earn the dedicated to safety award and meet additional criteria for customer service attendance and other performance metrics further our industryleading safety training program focus 6 provides employees with tips and techniques to prevent the six most common types of serious accidents backing intersections pushpulllift rear collisions rollover and pedestrian 

we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award the national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year republic drivers have won 14 of the 18 driver of the year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009 

learning and talent development 

we are committed to developing our employees throughout their careers targeted onboarding experiences including our driver training center supervisor onboarding and sales acceleration programs focus on providing the fundamental skills each employee needs to succeed in his or her role our leadership trainee program an 18month rotational experience for recent graduates is another example of our commitment to providing opportunities for growth 

developing our leaders is also a critical part of our people and talent agenda from leadership fundamentals a program for new front line supervisors to our republic services executive institute a program for our highest potential executives we have developed programs and experiences to ensure that as our leaders progress they are accumulating the skills necessary to be successful at each level over the last year more than 1000 leaders have completed our leadership fundamentals program creating a common language and toolkit for how we coach and develop employees 

diversity and inclusion 

we are actively and intentionally creating an environment in which all individuals are welcomed and valued in 2013 we launched mosaic as our renewed approach and commitment to diversity and inclusion through mosaic we have developed new strategies and activities to continue creating a more diverse workforce and inclusive work environment in this way we can leverage our best thinking to improve our culture and better serve our customers 

we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2015 for example 28 of general managers 27 of operations managers and 35 of maintenance managers that we hired selfidentified as having served in the us army navy marines air force or coast guard 

customer zeal 

the goal of our customer zeal pillar is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs we believe this increases customer loyalty and willingness to pay for a higher value service 

to help our sales team with their ability to identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering we launched priority based selling pbs and our capture pricing tool nationwide 

 5 

to ensure a consistent customer experience we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the new stateoftheart facilities and the technology deployed will provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service across a myriad of touch points including voice email text social media channels and live chat 

to ensure our efforts are making an impact and building customer loyalty we also have enhanced the way we receive feedback from our customers including net promoter score to ensure that every general manager receives recent relevant feedback that allows him or her the ability to reach out to customers directly and address issues immediately 

digital platform 

the goal of our digital platform pillar is to allow us to provide a consistent experience across our business while enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information 

we are responding to our customers requests for options to do business with us digitally by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our webbased market presence we believe we enhance customer satisfaction interaction and connectivity while lowering our costs these tools reinforce to our customers that they can rely on us to handle their recycling and waste needs in a way that is easy and convenient for them 

 we believe that leveraging technology to improve our core business strengthens our existing model and customer relationships and will serve to solidify our differentiated offering 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

in addition to being committed to our customers and employees we are also committed to the communities we serve and to the environment we strive to be america’s preferred recycling and waste services partner at republic we believe in the preservation of our blue planet  a cleaner safer and healthier world 

we believe we have a responsibility to regenerate our planet with the materials we are entrusted to handle every day by driving increased recycling generating renewable energy and helping our customers be more resourceful additionally we must lead by example working diligently to improve our relationship with the environment and society through decreased vehicle emissions innovative landfill technologies use of renewable energy community engagement and employee growth opportunities sustainability contributes to a cleaner world while also providing opportunities to improve brand awareness to increase customer loyalty to grow our business to motivate our employees and to differentiate republic from our competitors 

to maximize our efforts we have chosen to focus our sustainability platform around the following five areas 

 each of these areas has a significant impact on the environment and society and contributes to preserving our blue planet while forming the foundation of our business going forward we have developed programs that will enable us to reduce our emissions by 25 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next four years including developing at least two landfill 

gastoenergy projects each year adding at least 150000 tons per year of recycling capacity and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our fleet by 3 by 2018 

we are tracking our progress and performance and benchmarking against our industry peers and other companies outside of our industry in 2015  we participated in the carbon disclosure project cdp sp 500 climate change assessment the resulting report represents the progress companies achieve in reducing emissions responding to climaterelated risks and opportunities and mobilizing influence to manage climate change our 2015 cdp report score improved strongly from the prior year in 2014 our inaugural year we established our baseline for future submissions in 2015 we earned a disclosure score of 98 out of 100 which reflects our strong commitment to transparency thoroughness and responsibility and an a band in performance which is one of the highest performance scores possible we also released a sustainability report that modeled the gri g4 protocol which is available on our website at wwwrepublicservicescom 

additionally our board of directors formed a sustainability and corporate responsibility committee during 2015 this committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance our corporate responsibilities our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risk including cyber security environmental and reputational risks 

cash utilization strategy 

we believe our ability to consistently increase free cash flow drives shareholder value and also provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes investments in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa3 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2015  such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2015  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 030 per share representing a 71 increase over the prior year over the last 5 years our dividend has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 84 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2015  our board of directors added 900 million  to the existing share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2015  there were 8555 million  remaining under our share repurchase authorization at least annually our board of directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock during 2016  we expect to use approximately 400 million of our remaining authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock 

shareholder value 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management we have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters including governance and executive compensation 

management team 

we believe we have one of the most experienced management teams in the solid waste industry 

donald w slager  became our chief executive officer ceo and remained our president on january 1 2011 after having served as our president and chief operating officer coo from the allied waste industries inc allied acquisition in december 2008 until then in addition to his duties as ceo mr slager resumed the role of principal operating executive from november 2011 until august 2012 and then from october 2013 to june 2014 prior to the allied acquisition mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations mr slager held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was

our local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities we believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe republic is a company with a strong national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 68  of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority it is profitable to do so and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste recovering and recycling of certain materials and energy services 

collection services 

we provide residential smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial solid waste collection services through 340  collection operations in 2015  approximately 76  of our revenue was derived from our collection business within collection approximately 25  of our revenue relates to residential services approximately 31  relates to smallcontainer commercial services and approximately 21  relates to largecontainer industrial services 

our residential collection business involves the curbside collection of waste for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities these contracts usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market collection frequency type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service 

in our smallcontainer commercial business we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our smallcontainer commercial services are typically offered to small business complexes multifamily housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants retail realestate and professional and other services 

our largecontainer industrial collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships for the recurring portion we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform the collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal our recurring largecontainer industrial services are typically offered to larger facilities hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing retail hospitality and professional and other services 

for the temporary portion of our largecontainer industrial collection business the majority of the waste relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically eventdriven we provide temporary waste collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to oneyear or longer 

we also provide recycling collection services tailored to our customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services 

we own or operate 201  transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2015  our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services 

we own or operate 193  active landfills we charge tipping fees to third parties which accounted for approximately 12  of our revenue during 2015  as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 37100  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 5 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

republic is committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it to energy the use of landfill gas provides our economy with benefits including reducing air pollution through the capture and use of methane as of december 31 2015  we operated 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

we also have responsibility for 126  closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services 

we own or operate 67  recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ old newspaper onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 4  of our revenue during 2015  approximately 70  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper of the 51 million tons we sold during 2015  25 million moved through our recycling centers and 26 million we collected and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

energy services 

in addition to certain of our landfill disposal sites we own or operate 8  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 12  salt water disposal wells energy services waste is generated from the byproducts of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity including waste created throughout the initial drilling and completion of an oil or natural gas well production wastes and water produced during a wells operating life contaminated soils that require treatment during site reclamation substances that require cleanup after a spill as well as waste generated by coalfired power plants revenue is therefore primarily generated through vertical and horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing production and cleanup activity as well as other complementary services including closed loop collection systems and the sale of recovered products in 2015  approximately 1  of our revenue was derived from energy services energy services activity varies across market areas that are tied to the natural resource basins in which the drilling activity occurs and reflects the regulatory environment pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market 

other services 

other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publicly owned companies several regional publicly and privately owned companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from timetotime our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of largecontainer industrial and residential waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation 

the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 11 

damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 “substances” characterized by the epa as “hazardous” many of which are found in common household waste among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past two years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pickup trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 on june 19 2015 epa and nhtsa proposed additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 in issuing the proposed fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks and tractor trailers the government estimated that the increased equipment cost would be recouped over a period of two years for a tractortrailer combo and over a period of 6 years for a garbage truck and each vehicle would continue to save fuel costs over its operating life 

 state and local regulation 

each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a 

number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results

we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations  section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in item 7 of this form 10k and to note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

risk factors 

tableend this form 10k contains certain forwardlooking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” provided by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are statements that are not historical facts words such as “guidance” “expect” “will” “may” “anticipate” “plan” “estimate” “project” “intend” “should” “can” “likely” “could” “outlook” “believe” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements about our plans strategies and prospects forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance these statements are based upon our managements current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties including the risks set forth below in these risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied or projected by the forwardlooking information and statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct accordingly you should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this form 10k except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form 10k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial or energy services clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill from time to time our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the 

consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 3624 million  in 2015  or 40  of revenue compared to 5000 million  in 2014  or 57  of revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2015  approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers in general we recover approximately 80 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 22 million  on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 22 million  accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for 2016  and beyond these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows approximately 70  of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper 

historically to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range we currently have no  hedges outstanding at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 3° to 12° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure postclosure and remediation costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized further we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure postclosure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure postclosure and remediation obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure postclosure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure postclosure and remediation could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure postclosure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state 

and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 on june 19 2015 epa and nhtsa proposed additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2027 we cannot assure you that federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills on august 14 2015 the epa issued proposed amendments to its regulations that would require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases in a separate action commenced that same day the epa proposed updates to its 1996 emission guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills both actions are part of the obama administrations climate action plan  strategy to reduce methane emissions these regulations if finally adopted may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs we cannot assure you that the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur environmental liabilities arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of approximately 400 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 76 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our litigation matters obligations we could underestimate such accruals such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs 

valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 26  of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse impact on us 

we contribute to 27  multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 21  of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information while the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

overview 

republic is the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue as of december 31 2015  we operated in 41  states and puerto rico through 340  collection operations 201  transfer stations 193  active landfills 67  recycling centers 8  treatment recovery and disposal facilities and 12  salt water disposal wells we also operated 69  landfill gas and renewable energy projects and had postclosure responsibility for 126  closed landfills 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  increased by 35  to 91150 million  compared to 88033 million  in 2014  this change in revenue is due to increases in average yield of 23  volume of 11  and acquisitions net of divestitures of 22  partially offset by decreases in fuel recovery fees of 14  and recycled commodities of 07  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 11959 million  8853 million  and 8512 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 7499 million  or 213  per diluted share for 2015  compared to 5476 million  or 153  per diluted share for 2014  and 5889 million  or 162  per diluted share for 2013  

during each of 2015  2014  and 2013  we recorded a number of charges other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ cost of operations ” “ selling general and administrative expenses ” and “ income taxes ” discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings 

  



1 the aggregate impact of the noted items to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to 001 for the year ended december 31 2014 

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods in the case of the bridgeton remediation charges and insurance recovery we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often incur remediation charges and recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income – republic and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

bridgeton insurance recovery  remediation charge and other  during 2015  we collected an insurance recovery of 500 million  related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during 2014  we updated our cost and timeline estimates to build and operate a leachate management facility and related infrastructure manage the remediation area and monitor the site accordingly we recorded environmental remediation charges of 2106 million  additionally we recorded certain remediation charges for the superfund site and ongoing litigation costs during 2013  we recorded environmental remediation charges in the amount of 1087 million  to manage the remediation area and monitor the site 

negotiation and withdrawal costs  central states pension and other funds   during 2015  we recorded charges to earnings of 41 million  for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute related to our operations in puerto rico as well as 04 million of legal charges during 2014  we recorded charges to earnings of 15 million  primarily related to costs associated with our 2013 withdrawal from the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund during 2013  we recorded charges to earnings of 1577 million  primarily related to our negotiation and withdrawal liability from the fund 

restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of 2012 we announced a restructuring of our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes included consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels during 2014  we incurred costs of 18 million  due to a change in estimate of amounts recoverable from sublet income associated with abandoned office space with noncancellable lease terms during 2013  we incurred 86 million  of restructuring charges which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancelable terms for a detailed discussion of our 2016 restructuring see our “ recent developments ” discussion contained in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

loss on extinguishment of debt   we refinanced our credit facilities and certain of our taxexempt financings in 2014 resulting in noncash charges for deferred issuance costs of 14 million  during 2013  we refinanced certain of our taxexempt financings that resulted in a 21 million  noncash charge for deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net   during 2014 we recorded a charge to earnings of 200 million  primarily related to costs associated with one of our divested landfills of which 141 million  is related to closure and postclosure costs and 59 million  is related to remediation expenditures during 2013  we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets of and impairments related to a divestiture of 19 million  for a more detailed discussion of the components of this see our “ loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tax valuation allowance adjustment   during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reduced our valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards due to our determination that it is more likely than not that a portion of these carryforwards would be utilized in future years 

recent developments 

2016 financial guidance 

in 2016  we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returns to our shareholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2016  specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2016  revenue to increase by approximately 25 to 30 comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue of these restricted pricing arrangements 

 the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial impact of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2016 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap 

the 2016 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 395 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes restructuring charges bridgeton insurance recovery and withdrawal costs  other funds provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

property and equipment net 

in 2016  we anticipate receiving approximately 900 million of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment as follows 



restructuring 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining two organizational layers into one this includes the elimination of our three regions the consolidation of our 20 areas into 10 and the streamlining of select roles at our phoenix headquarters we will reinvest and deploy resources into our areas by creating 10 area offices equipped with enhanced teams of operators and functional support roles we expect to reduce administrative staffing levels relocate office space and close certain office locations as such we will incur restructuring charges of approximately 25 million primarily for severance benefits transition costs and lease termination costs substantially all of these charges will be recorded in our corporate segment and we expect the majority of the charges to be incurred in the first half of 2016 we expect the savings realized from these restructuring efforts will be reinvested in our customerfocused programs and other initiatives we recently launched 

additionally as part of these customer initiatives we also will be consolidating our call center operations over the next two years we will consolidate over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers the new stateoftheart facilities and the technology deployed will provide our customer service employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better service to customers across a myriad of touch points including voice email text social channels and live chat we expect severance and other restructuring related charges may approximate 10 million over the consolidation period 

results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station landfill disposal recycling and energy services our residential and smallcontainer commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities our revenue from energy services consists mainly of fees we charge for the treatment of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas as well as waste generated by coalfired power plants other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in components of our revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies average yield as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 26 15 and 14 for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively core price as a percentage of relatedbusiness revenue was 40 34 and 36 for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

revenue – 2015  compared to 2014 

during 2015  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2014  

 changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

 revenue – 2014  compared to 2013 

during 2014  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2013  

 32 

accounts contracts partially offset by declines in our residential collection and transfer station lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased special waste volumes 

 cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management costs which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycled commodities and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

cost of operations  2015  compared to 2014 

excluding the impact of the bridgeton insurance recovery our cost of operations increased for 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of the following 

 33 

 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 22 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 22 million  per year 

 cost of operations – 2014  compared to 2013 

our cost of operations increased for 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of the following

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2015  compared to 2014 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles increased trucks to support volume growth additional assets acquired with our acquisitions and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational over the past several quarters 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion rate additionally during 2015  we recorded favorable amortization adjustments of 07 million  relative to asset retirement obligations compared to favorable amortization adjustments of 133 million  during 2014  

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2014  compared to 2013 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion rate offsetting these increases were favorable amortization adjustments of 133 million  that were recognized in 2014 relative to asset retirement obligations compared to favorable adjustments of 03 million in 2013 included in these favorable adjustments are increases in deemed probable expansion airspace at certain of our active solid waste landfills 

amortization of other intangible assets and other assets 

expenses for amortization of other intangible assets and other assets were 719 million  684 million  and 707 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively or 08  of revenue for each of 2015  2014  and 2013  our other intangible assets and other assets primarily relate to customer relationships franchise agreements other municipal agreements favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements and trade names the increase in amortization expense is the result of assets acquired in the acquisitions of various waste businesses throughout the year partially offset by certain intangible assets now being fully amortized 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 794 million  780 million  and 766 million  or 09  of revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively accretion expense has remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period

these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2015  compared to 2014 

salaries increased primarily due to higher wages benefits and other payroll related items resulting from merit increases and increased headcount as well as higher management incentive compensation 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with strategic growth initiatives as well as acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs primarily associated with our acquisition of tervita in february 2015 this increase was partially offset by favorable litigation results during 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2014  compared to 2013 

salaries increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from merit increases increased headcount and management incentive pay 

provision for doubtful accounts increased primarily due to a net favorable adjustment recorded in our corporate segment in 2013 of 83 million  resulting from a change in our estimated future bad debts 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with strategic growth initiatives as well as costs incurred with the acquisition of various solid waste businesses

we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time in situations where we cannot establish a leading market position or where operations are not generating acceptable returns we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets asset or business divestitures could result in gains losses or asset impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

restructuring charges

total interest expense increased during 2015  due to the issuance of 5000 million  of 320  notes in march 2015 as well as borrowings under our credit facilities 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million and resulted in a 75 million  reduction in interest expense during 2015  compared to a 77 million  reduction in interest expense during 2014  and a 20 million  reduction in interest expense during 2013  additionally there were lower variable rates on our taxexempt financings which also contributed to the reduction in interest expense during 2014

revenue for 2015  increased 11  from 2014  primarily due to increases in average yield in all collection lines of business and volume increases in our largecontainer industrial and residential collection and transfer station lines of business these increases were partially offset by declines in volume in our smallcontainer commercial collection line of business as well as a decline in volume in our landfill line of business resulting from lower special waste volumes additionally we recognized lower recycled commodity revenue due to the decline in commodity prices 

operating income in our east region increased from 4296 million  for 2014  or a 172  operating margin to 4750 million  for 2015 or an 188  operating margin the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 central region 

revenue for 2015  increased 20  from 2014  primarily due to average yield increases in all lines of business and volume increases in our smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial collection and landfill lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased municipal solid waste volumes offset by a decline in our special waste volumes additionally there was a decline in volume in our transfer station line of business and lower recycled commodity revenue due to the decline in commodity prices 

operating income in our central region increased from 5036 million  or a 191  operating margin to 5277 million  or a 197  operating margin the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 west region 

revenue for 2015  increased 70  from 2014  primarily due to acquisitions including a waste management contract with the county of sonoma california that was executed in april 2015 on an aggregate basis acquisitions increased revenue by 1421 million excluding the impact of acquisitions revenue increased due to increases in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all collection lines of business additionally revenue increased due to volume increases in our landfill line of business except for our base energy services waste volumes partially offsetting these revenue increases was lower recycled commodity revenue due to the decline in commodity prices 

operating income in our west region increased from 8257 million  for 2014  to 8324 million  for 2015  operating margin decreased from 236  for 2014  to 223  for 2015  overall our operating margins were unfavorably impacted due to the impact of commodity prices on our recycling business and higher integration transition and operating costs in our acquired energy services business the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities decreased from 5258 million  for 2014  to 2763 million  for 2015  primarily due to an insurance recovery of 500 million  related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2015 compared to unfavorable remediation and litigation adjustments in 2014  of 2271 million partially offsetting this improvement were additional costs associated with strategic growth initiatives as well as acquisitionrelated transaction costs primarily associated with our acquisition of tervita in february 2015 additionally we recognized an unfavorable impact from higher labor and related benefits including management incentive compensation 

2014  compared to 2013   

east region 

revenue for 2014  increased 18  from 2013  primarily due to increases in average yield in all lines of business except for landfill construction and demolition volumes increased in our smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial collection transfer station and landfill special waste and construction and demolition lines of business but were partially offset by the decline in volume in our residential collection line of business these increases were also partially offset by lower recycled commodity revenue 

operating income in our east region decreased from 4510 million  for 2013  or an 184  operating margin to 4296 million  for 2014  or a 172  operating margin the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 central region 

revenue for 2014  increased 47  from 2013  primarily due to average yield increases in our smallcontainer commercial and largecontainer industrial collection and transfer station lines of business as well as volume increases in all collection and landfill lines of business except for construction and demolition these increases were partially offset by lowered recycled commodity revenue and a decrease in volume in our transfer station line of business 

operating income increased and operating margin decreased in our central region from 4945 million  for 2013  or a 197  operating margin to 5036 million  for 2014 or a 191  operating margin 

the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 • for 2014 the depreciation and amortization of property and equipment margin impact was flat 

 west region 

revenue for 2014  increased 51  from 2013  due to increases in average yield in all core lines of business and increases in volume in our collection and landfill lines of business volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased special waste volumes 

operating income in our west region increased from 7666 million  for 2013  or a 231  operating margin to 8257 million  for 2014  or a 236  operating margin primarily as a result of increased revenue and the following 

 corporate entities 

operating loss in our corporate entities increased from 5018 million  for 2013  to 5258 million  for 2014  the increase in operating loss primarily relates to unfavorable remediation and litigation adjustments in 2014  of 2271 million recorded at our closed bridgeton landfill compared to 1087 million  recorded in 2013  additionally during 2013  we recorded a net favorable adjustment of 83 million  resulting from a change in our estimated future bad debts favorable remediation adjustments of 171 million relating to changes in the estimated timing of payments for our remediation obligations and a favorable remediation adjustment for a closed landfill site of 121 million which did not recur in 2014  partially offsetting this increase in operating loss was a charge to earnings of 1407 million in 2013  for our partial withdrawal liability from the fund and puerto rico multiemployer pension plans which also did not recur in 2014  

restructuring 

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining two organizational layers into one this includes the elimination of our three regions the consolidation of our 20 areas into 10 and the streamlining of select roles at our phoenix headquarters the areas will be grouped and overseen by two executive vice presidents of operations in connection with our restructuring we will further evaluate our 2016 reporting segments 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the 

site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 







changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2015  we owned or operated 193  active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 49666 million  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2015  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 46765 million  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2901 million  inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore 

included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates  section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  twelve  of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these twelve  landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 46 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 65 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2015  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2015  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 11816 million  of which 874 million  were current and 10942 million  were longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill during the year ended december 31 2015  we paid 345 million  related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts from time to time this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures which could result in changes to our expected liability as of december 31 2015  the remediation liability recorded for this site is 2175 million  of which 217 million  is expected to be paid during 2016  we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately 164 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2015  

during 2015 we collected an insurance recovery of 500 million  related to our bridgeton landfill as such we recorded a reduction of remediation expenses included in our cost of operations during the year ended december 31 2015  

congress landfill   in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2015 is 785 million  of which 34 million  is expected to be paid during 2016 we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately 16 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2015 because favorable developments have occurred with respect to 1 the volume of leachate pumped at the site and 2 our ability to dispose of leachate in the local publicly owned treatment works we no longer need to expand the onsite treatment facility and 

our expected costs have decreased from prior years further the majority of the final order requirements have been satisfied and the site now is primarily going through routine operation for a closed landfill accordingly we will omit the congress landfill from future reports 

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2015 in millions 





  

  





the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 



during 2015 and 2014 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

as of december 31 2015 we expect to spend an estimated additional  82 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  117 billion  or  236  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 in millions of dollars 













liquidity and capital resources 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2015  2014  and 2013  are discussed in the following paragraphs the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2015  and 2014  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 3167 million  in 2015  compared to a decrease of 2956 million  in 2014  primarily as a result of the following 

 47 

 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 321 million  and 382 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively income taxes paid in 2015 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the protecting americans from tax hikes act signed into law in december 2015 cash paid for interest was 3276 million  and 3202 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2014  and 2013  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 2956 million  in 2014  compared to a decrease of 2566 million  in 2013  primarily as a result of the following 

 in addition cash paid for income taxes was approximately 382 million  and 288 million  for 2014  and 2013  respectively the increase was primarily due to higher expected taxable income and the related deductible timing differences associated with certain remediation charges 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2015  2014  and 2013  are summarized below 

 48 

250 million in connection with issuances of taxexempt bonds during 2014  and 2013  respectively funds received from issuances of taxexempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures or for repayments of the related taxexempt bonds are presented as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows such reimbursements amounted to 187 million 511 million and 278 million during 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2015  2014  and 2013  are summarized below 

 financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2015  we had 324 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 1003 million  of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 21 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 168 million pursuant to a holdback arrangement 273 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 541 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

credit facilities 

in june 2014 we entered into a 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the replacement credit facility which replaced our 10 billion credit facility maturing in april 2016 the replacement credit facility matures in june 2019 and includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount up to 5000 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the replacement credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 

contemporaneous with the execution of the replacement credit facility we entered into amendment no 3 to our existing 125 billion unsecured credit facility the existing credit facility and together with the replacement credit facility the credit facilities to reduce the commitments under the existing credit facility to 10 billion and conform certain terms of the 

existing credit facility with those of the replacement credit facility amendment no 3 does not extend the maturity date of the existing credit facility which matures in may 2017 the existing credit facility also maintains the feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 5000 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 

the credit agreements require us to comply with financial and other covenants to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants we cannot pay dividends and repurchase common stock compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2015  our ebitda to interest ratio was 717 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 289 compared to the 375 maximum allowed by the covenants in connection with entering into the replacement credit facility and amendment no 3 to the existing credit facility our maximum total debt to ebitda ratio was increased to 375 for each fiscal quarter ending before and including december 31 2015 and 350 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2016 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

availability under our credit facilities totaled 17277 million  and 16154 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and can be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had no borrowings under our credit facilities we had 5033 million  and  6151 million  of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we also have a 1250 million  unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility bearing interest at libor plus an applicable margin our uncommitted credit facility is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2015  we had 190 million  of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2015  we issued 5000 million  of 320  notes due 2025 the 320  notes the 320  notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations we used the net proceeds from the 320  notes to refinance debt incurred in connection with our acquisition of all of the equity interests of tervita during 2015  

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 63646 million and 58636 million respectively of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2041 

interest rate swap agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2015  these swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for 2015  and 2014  we recognized 75 million  and 77 million  respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 10791 million  and 10838 million  respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2044 approximately 90 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as longterm because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

as of december 31 2015  we had 1003 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 21 million  represented proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2015  see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were current liabilities of 378 million  and 344 million  respectively and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2015  and 2014  net of tax of 223 million and 203 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

during 2015  and 2014 approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we generally recover approximately 80 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from customers 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper from time to time we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we had no outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  for further discussion see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2015  for variable rate debt the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2015  

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2015  and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2016  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table calculates our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars   

for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow see our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities  contained elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures the following table reconciles property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in millions of dollars 



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that presenting free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine executive compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  note 10 income taxes  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure 

and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs 

together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of 

performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 20 in 2015 23 in 2014 and 25 in 2013 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 475 in 2015 45 in 2014 and 50 in 2013 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

 56 

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity

 environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

 insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance programs for workers compensation commercial general and auto liability environmental and remediation liability and employeerelated health care benefits are subject to high deductible insurance policies accruals for insurance or 

deductible reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 30 million to 50 million 

residual risks 

 loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 58 

recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually as of december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists during 2015  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment for our reporting units to october 1 st  this voluntary change in the annual goodwill testing date is a change in accounting principle which we believe is preferable as it better aligns the timing of the assessment with our planning and forecasting process and also provides additional time to complete our annual assessment in advance of our yearend reporting this change in assessment date was applied prospectively and did not delay accelerate or avoid a potential impairment charge 

we test goodwill for impairment using a twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

during 2015 we managed and evaluated our operations through three regions east central and west in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 3  to 5  2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40  3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 6  and 8  and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of october 1 2015 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control 

as of october 1 2015 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 50  on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment

in january 2016 we realigned our field support functions by combining two organizational layers into one this includes the elimination of our three regions the consolidation of our 20 areas into 10 and the streamlining of select roles at our phoenix headquarters the areas will be grouped and overseen by two executive vice presidents of operations in connection with our restructuring we will further evaluate our 2016 reporting segments we have considered the implications of our restructuring on our reporting units used to measure for goodwill impairment and we have noted no indicators of goodwill impairment 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred taxes and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available

defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our employee benefits committee as of december 31 2015  the plan assets were invested in fixed income funds equity funds and cash the employee benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary as of december 31 2015  and 2014 the plan was underfunded by 54 million  and 42 million  respectively 

residual risk 

 assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates mortality rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 20 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 24 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned there are no participants in the plan that continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement”   



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 616 million  additionally during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2015  our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 22 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 22 million  per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 3624 million  in 2015  or 40  of revenue compared to 5000 million  in 2014  or 57  of revenue and 5167 million  in 2013  or 61  of revenue 

for additional discussion and detail of our fuel hedges see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our recycling centers market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million  and 18 million  respectively 

revenue from sales of these products in 2015  2014  and 2013  was 3720 million  4058 million  and 3746 million  respectively

business 

tableend overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste services industry as measured by revenue as of december 31 2014 we operate in 39 states and puerto rico we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 340  collection operations we own or operate 198  transfer stations 189  active solid waste landfills and 60  recycling centers we also operate 72 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

based on an industry trade publication the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 55 billion of which approximately 45 is recognized by publicly owned waste companies industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous solid waste services industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35 and 20 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

we manage and evaluate our operations through three geographic operating regions that are also our reportable segments east central and west each region is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our regions and all of our operating areas provide collection transfer recycling and landfill services we believe this structure facilitates integrating our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy it also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while minimizing administrative overhead costs and maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

our core priorities 

commitment to safety 

republic is dedicated to the safety of our employees customers and the communities we serve due to the nature of our industry we prioritize safety above all else and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records over the past 7 years our safety performance based on osha recordable rates has been 42 better than the industry average our think choose live  slogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to think  about what you are doing choose  the safe answer and live  to go home to your family with the phrase printed on numerous items including hard hats and equipment our employees touch there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition that they came to work our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night 

we are proud of our two safety incentive programs dedicated to safety and dedicated to excellence for dedicated to safety employees must meet all safety requirements for the year including no preventable accidents and no safety warnings for dedicated to excellence employees must earn the dedicated to safety award and meet additional criteria for customer service attendance and other performance metrics during 2014 approximately 12000 of our employees earned the dedicated to safety award and almost 6000 earned the dedicated to excellence recognition further our industryleading safety training program focus 6 provides employees with tips and techniques to prevent the six most common types of serious accidents backing intersections pushpulllift rear collisions rollover and pedestrian 

we take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award national waste  recycling association’s driver of the year since 2009 republic drivers have won driver of the year for the large truck category 10 out of 12 times in 2014 republic swept the category with all three winners large residential large industrial and large commercial 

commitment to compliance 

we also are dedicated to compliance compliance with laws and our policies and procedures is essential to our efforts to gain and keep the confidence and support of customers regulatory and other governmental agencies suppliers and the public most important compliance is simply the right thing to do and is a critical part of the way we do business thus we require all of our employees and independent contractors to comply with all applicable laws and rules our compliance program and our code of business ethics and conduct we also require them to report any violation or illegal activity to us so that we may deal with it appropriately 

environmental and social 

republic has made and continues to make significant investments in highimpact areas of our business to provide meaningful improvements in environmental and social conditions and we publicly report on our efforts in these areas 

environmental   in 2014 we participated in the carbon disclosure project cdp sp 500 climate change report the report represents the progress companies achieve in reducing emissions responding to climaterelated risks and opportunities and mobilizing influence to manage climate change for our first year which creates a baseline for future submissions we earned a disclosure score of 93 out of 100 which reflects our strong commitment to transparency thoroughness and responsibility and a c band in performance which we see as a strong starting point for a firstyear responder we also recently released a sustainability report which modeled the cdp protocol our sustainability report which is available on our website at wwwrepublicservicescom reflects our work in republic’s five pillars of sustainability operations materials management communities safety and people 

with approximately 16000 trucks on the road republic operates the 8th largest vocational fleet in the country approximately 2200 of our vehicles are powered by compressed natural gas cng at our 36 natural gas fueling stations nationwide roughly 35 of the vehicles we bought in 2014 are powered by this domestic fuel source we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage while reducing the amount of fuel required for our operations improving air emissions and significantly reducing vehicle noise profiles our cng fleet has carbon emission reduction benefits equal to removing nearly 13000 taxis from the roads 

republic has 60  recycling centers across the nation we collected nearly 5 million tons of recyclable materials in 2014 enabling discarded items to be regenerated into newspaper cardboard glass and plastic bottles tissue paper towels and metal cans recycling this quantity of material saves 15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e which is nearly as much as our entire carbon footprint 

republic is equally committed to harnessing landfill gas the natural byproduct of decomposing waste and converting it into energy we operate 72  landfill gas and renewable energy projects across the country annually these projects generate enough electricity to power approximately 400000 households meeting the needs of a community the size of austin texas in addition the carbon emission reductions benefit from our current landfill gas and renewable energy projects is equal to removing more than 4 million cars from the roads 

social   we believe there is no better way to protect our planet than to recruit and hire the heroes who have protected our country we actively recruit and hire veterans  those transitioning from military life as well as those long discharged from active duty we value the skills experience and operational excellence they bring to our organization as well as their commitment to a better tomorrow historically we have had great success hiring veterans in 2012 for example 33 of general managers 20 of operations managers and 38 of maintenance managers that we hired selfidentified as having served in the us coast guard army navy marines or air force 

customer experience 

we strive to provide the highest level of customer service this means placing the focus squarely on our customers by listening and responding as well as anticipating their wants and needs we then determine how to best meet our customers expectations by delivering and implementing superior customized solutions we frequently visit customers to ensure customer service and satisfaction and confirm their expectations are being met we also have municipal marketing representatives who are responsible for working with municipalities or communities to which we provide residential service

our local management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities each regional management team includes a region 

president vice president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe our strong regional management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions areas and business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe we have created a company with a strong national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 68  of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority and it is profitable to do so 

growth initiatives 

our growth initiatives are designed to deliver total waste stream solutions to our customers while creating sustainable economic value for our shareholders we believe focusing on the following growth initiatives will improve profitability and generate value for our shareholders 

internal growth 

within our markets our goal is to deliver sustainable longterm profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate attractive rates of return we allocate capital to businesses markets and development projects both to support growth and to achieve acceptable rates of return the key components of our internal growth strategy are 

price growth we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in vehicles equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling centers 

volume growth we believe waste volumes are driven by population growth household formation and new business formation volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste under residential collection contracts with municipalities exclusive franchise agreements and commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets in addition by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue we are better able to protect our market position from competition we work to increase volumes while ensuring that prices charged for services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

sales and marketing activities and national accounts we manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate while most of our marketing activity is local in nature we also employ a national accounts selling organization in response to the needs of national and regional customers the national accounts team is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts team centralizes certain services like customer support and billing to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize costs with our extended geographic reach this team effectively serves our customers nationwide 

acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships 

our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies we also will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies generally we expect to maintain a steady pace of tuckin acquisition investment of approximately 100 million annually given our free 

cash flow availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets we also have the flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform or larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves 

we also focus on the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governmental authorities for growth opportunities we believe our ability to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing is growing as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

expansion of recycling capabilities 

based on an industry trade publication we believe approximately 34 of municipal solid waste is recycled communities have increasingly committed to their residents to enhance and expand their recycling programs we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices we currently own or operate 60  recycling centers during 2014 we invested approximately 20 million to develop and upgrade our recycling centers we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our recycling capabilities in markets where these services are desired and provide an appropriate return on our investment 

development activities 

we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated where appropriate we obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate return on investment of capital where operations are not generating acceptable returns we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through integrating additional assets if such enhancements are not possible we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

cost control initiatives 

our cost control initiatives are designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient productive and environmentally sound way possible 

fleet automation 

approximately 69 of our residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng 

approximately 14 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng our preferred alternative fuel technology as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 35 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2014 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission objectives or initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront costs are higher we expect that using natural gas will reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses during 2014 we added 7 cng fueling stations to our operations to bring our total cng fueling stations that we operate to 36 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2014 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality while extending the service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable safer and efficient fleet will lower our operating costs we have implemented standardized maintenance programs for approximately 60 of our fleet maintenance operations as of december 31 2014 

cash utilization strategy 

key components of our cash utilization strategy include increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for a discussion and reconciliation of free cash flow you should read the free cash flow section of our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this form 10k 

we believe free cash flow drives shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes investments in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2003 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 004 per share our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter the latest increase occurring in july 2014 to 028 per share representing a 77 increase over that of the prior year over the last 5 years our dividend has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 81 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value 

share repurchases 

in october 2013 our board of directors added 650 million to the existing share repurchase authorization originally approved in november 2010 from november 2010 to december 31 2014 we used  14395 million to repurchase 466 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost per share of 3088  as of december 31 2014 there were 3602 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization during 2015 we expect to use our remaining authorization to repurchase more of our outstanding common stock 

strong capital structure 

since our merger with allied on december 5 2008 we have refinanced 52882 million in senior notes and 12601 million in taxexempt financings this reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and taxexempt financings on a weighted average basis by more than 175 basis points while extending our debt maturities and giving greater stability to our capital structure our debt maturity and revolver capacity profile is as follows dollars in millions 

a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings services bbb by fitch ratings inc and baa3 by moody’s investors service inc as of december 31 2014 such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operations 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and recovering and recycling certain materials 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 340  collection operations in 2014 77  of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 25  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 31  is from services provided to commercial customers and 21  is from services provided to industrial both permanent and temporary and other customers 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential solid waste collection services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste to either a transfer station or directly to a landfill for disposal 

we also provide recycling services based on our collection customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services we own or operate 198  transfer stations revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2014 our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services we own or operate 189  active landfills we charge tipping fees to third parties which accounted for approximately 12  of our revenue during 2014 as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 37000  permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of 48 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

we also have responsibility for 125  closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services we own or operate 60  recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ old newspaper onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 4  of our revenue during 2014 approximately 70 of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper of the 49 million tons we sold during 2014 23 million moved through our recycling centers and 26 million we collected and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 28 million  and 16 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at thirdparty facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

other services other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in a competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 10 

its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 “substances” characterized by the epa as “hazardous” many of which are found in common household waste among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past two years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories 

for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pickup trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 in issuing the fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks and tractor trailers the government estimated the standards would increase the cost of the average tractortrailer by approximately 6200 but that the vehicle would save fuel costs over its operating life 

 state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and 

regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations  section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in item 7 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions or deductibles provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

tableend this form 10k contains certain forwardlooking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” provided by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are statements that are not historical facts words such as “guidance” “expect” “will” “may” “anticipate” “plan” “estimate” “project” “intend” “should” “can” “likely” “could” “outlook” “believe” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements about our plans strategies and prospects forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance these statements are based upon our managements current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties including the risks set forth below in these risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied or projected by the forwardlooking information and statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct accordingly you should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this form 10k except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form 10k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 7 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

weakness in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

weakness in the us economy reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition weakness in the economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill from time to time our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 5000 million  in 2014 or 57  of revenue compared to 5167 million in 2013 or 61 of our revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2014 approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers for 2014 we were able to recover approximately 78  of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million  on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for 2015 and beyond these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2014 approximately 6  of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 28 million  and 16 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 4° to 11° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure or postclosure costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and 

regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 we cannot assure you that federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as it relates to stationary sources of greenhouse gases in may 2010 the epa finalized the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations based upon such sources total greenhouse gas emissions recent efforts to challenge the tailoring rule before the us court of the appeals for the district of columbia the dc circuit have failed most recently a federal appellate court decision has called into question certain regulatory deferrals that had been established for biogenic carbon dioxide emissions including those from landfills the dc circuit struck down the epa’s july 2011 rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to biogenic carbon emissions subsequently on july 17 2014 the epa proposed updates to its regulations that would require large landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after july 17 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain nonmethane gases which are recognized as greenhouse gases that same day the epa also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking input on whether and how to update emissions limits for existing landfills to further reduce their emissions of methane and nonmethane greenhouse gases these regulations if finally adopted may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems with resulting capital or operating costs we cannot assure you that the application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability 

notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because among other things hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired environmental laws may change or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us for example during 2012 through 2014 we recorded an aggregate of 3934 million in charges relating to environmental remediation at our closed landfill in bridgeton missouri actual costs for liabilities at bridgeton or other sites could be significantly greater than amounts we have accrued for these purposes environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 27  of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse impact on us 

we contribute to 27  multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 20  of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa except as discussed in note 11 employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

a cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cyber security risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information while the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk if we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

legal proceedings 

tableend general legal proceedings 

we are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements in the normal course of our business we become involved in legal proceedings some may result in fines penalties or judgments against us which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

as used herein the term legal proceedings  refers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries excluding 1 ordinary course accidents general commercial liability and workers compensation claims which are covered by insurance programs subject to customary deductibles and which together with selfinsured employee health care costs are discussed in note 7 other liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k and 2 environmental remediation liabilities which are discussed in note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k  

we accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable we have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately 68 million  relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of december 31 2014 as of the end of each applicable reporting period we review each of our legal proceedings and where it is probable that a liability has been incurred we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to such a matter we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we use the amount that is the low end of such range if we had used the high ends of such ranges our aggregate potential liability would be approximately 74 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2014

revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  increased by 44  to 87883 million  compared to 84172 million  in 2013  this change in revenue is due to increases in average yield of 14  fuel recovery fees of 01  volume of 20  recycled commodities of 01  and acquisitions net of divestitures of 08  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue   



our pretax income was 8853 million  8512 million  and 8239 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 5476 million  or 153  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 5889 million  or 162  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2013  and 5718 million  or 155  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2012

1 the aggregate impact of these items noted to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to 001 for the year ended december 31 2014 

we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods in the case of the bridgeton remediation charges we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often incur remediation adjustments that we do not adjust from our operating results our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2015 the guidance includes the expected financial impact from the acquisition of tervita llc in february 2015 specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2015 revenue to increase by approximately 40 to 50 comprised of the following 



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue of these restricted pricing arrangements 

 28 

 the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial impact of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

diluted earnings per share 

we expect 2015 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 198 to 204 

property and equipment net 

in 2015 we anticipate receiving approximately 885 million of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment as follows 



results of operations 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station services landfill disposal and recycling our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 



the following table reflects changes in our revenue for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



revenue – 2014  compared to 2013 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2013  

 30 

93 per ton for 2013  our recycled commodity volume for 2014  of 23 million tons sold was approximately 4 higher than the volume in 2013  as a result of our continued investment in recycling centers along with increases in brokering of recycled commodity volumes on behalf of our national accounts customers 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 28 million  and 16 million  respectively 

revenue – 2013  compared to 2012 

during the year ended december 31 2013  we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2012  

 cost of operations

cost of operations  2014  compared to 2013 

our cost of operations increased 3934 million or as a percentage of revenue 18 for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of the following 

 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 26 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 

 32 

 cost of operations – 2013  compared to 2012 

our cost of operations increased 2290 million or as a percentage of revenue an increase of 05 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the following

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2014  compared to 2013 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in aggregate dollars increased primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational over the past several quarters 

landfill depletion and amortization expense in aggregate dollars increased primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes and an overall increase in our average depletion rate offsetting these increases were favorable amortization adjustments of 133 million that were recognized in 2014 relative to asset retirement obligations compared to favorable amortization adjustments of 03 million in 2013 included in these favorable adjustments are increases in deemed probable expansion airspace at certain of our active solid waste landfills 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2013  compared to 2012

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 







changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2014  we owned or operated 189  active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 48458 million  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2014  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 45841 million  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2617 million  inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates  section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2014  ten  of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these ten  landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 49 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 66 years we have 

other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2014  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2014  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 11443 million  of which 879 million  are current and 10564 million  are longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill as of december 31 2014 the remediation liability recorded for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri was 2403 million  of which 30 million  is expected to be paid during 2015 during the year ended december 31 2014 we paid 643 million  related to construction of a leachate management facility and related infrastructure as well as management and monitoring of the remediation area during the three months ended march 31 2014 we recorded a charge to earnings of 361 million  primarily related to the design and construction of a leachate management facility as the nature and extent of our leachate remediation efforts continued to change it became necessary to upgrade treatment facility design features and infrastructure in the third quarter of 2014 we completed construction of the leachate management facility but it was not functioning at full capacity and was still in a testing mode in the fourth quarter of 2014 we updated our cost and timeline estimates to operate the leachate management facility manage the remediation area and monitor the site accordingly we recorded an environmental remediation charge of 1745 million  we expect the facility will function at full capacity in the first half of 2015 we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts from time to time this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures which could result in changes to our expected liability we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately 160 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2014  

congress landfill  in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2014  is 834 million  of which 50 million  is expected to be paid during 2015 we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately 70 million  higher than the amount recorded as of december 31 2014  

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2014 in millions 





  

  





the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 



during 2014 and 2013 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

as of december 31 2014 we expect to spend an estimated additional  77 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  111 billion  or  229  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 in millions of dollars 













liquidity and capital resources 

the major components of changes in cash flows for 2014 2013 and 2012 are discussed below the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions of dollars 



cash flows provided by operating activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2014  and 2013  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 2956 million  in 2014 compared to a decrease of 2566 million in 2013 primarily as a result of the following 

 47 

 the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2013  and 2012  are summarized below 

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 2566 million in 2013 compared to a decrease of 3770 million in 2012 primarily as a result of the following 

 cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities are summarized below 

 48 

million during 2013 is primarily due to investments in restricted cash related to our insurance program we received 500 million 250 million and 247 million in connection with an issuance of taxexempt bonds during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures or for repayments of the related taxexempt bonds are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows such reimbursements amounted to 511 million 278 million and 224 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2012 we paid 295 million to settle a legal matter that was funded through a restricted escrow account in 2011 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to use primarily cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities are summarized below 

 financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2014 we had  752 million  of cash and cash equivalents and  1156 million  of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 209 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 168 million pursuant to a holdback arrangement 267 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 504 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

credit facilities 

in june 2014 we entered into a 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the replacement credit facility which replaced our 10 billion credit facility maturing in april 2016 the replacement credit facility matures in june 2019 and includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount up to 5000 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the replacement credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 

contemporaneous with the execution of the replacement credit facility we entered into amendment no 3 to our existing 125 billion unsecured credit facility the existing credit facility and together with the replacement credit facility the credit facilities to reduce the commitments under the existing credit facility to 10 billion and conform certain terms of the existing credit facility with those of the replacement credit facility amendment no 3 does not extend the maturity date of the existing credit facility which matures in may 2017 the existing credit facility also maintains the feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount of up to 5000 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders 

the credit agreements require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2014 our ebitda to interest ratio was 637 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 316 compared to the 375 maximum allowed by the covenants in connection with entering into the replacement credit facility and amendment no 3 to the existing credit facility our maximum total debt to ebitda ratio was increased to 375 for each fiscal quarter ending before and including december 31 2015 and 350 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2015 

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

availability under our credit facilities totaled 16154 million  and 15279 million  as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and can be used for working capital capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2014  and 2013 we had no borrowings under our credit facilities we had 6151 million  and  7221 million  of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

we have a 1250 million  unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility bearing interest at libor plus an applicable margin our uncommitted credit facility is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had no borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated at any time by either party 

in january 2015 we entered into a 200 million  uncommitted credit facility agreement the puerto rico facility that matures in 2016 and bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin we can use borrowings under the puerto rico facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

senior notes and debentures 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 58636 million and 58444 million respectively of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2041 

interest rate swap agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these transactions were entered into to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2014  our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we recognized 77 million  and 20 million  respectively as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements which mature in may 2023 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 10838 million  and 10877 million respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2015 to 2044 approximately 90 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as longterm because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

as of december 31 2014  we had 1156 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 209 million  represented proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2014  see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2014  and 2013  were current liabilities of 344 million  and 01 million  respectively and current assets of 67 million  as of december 31 2013  and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2014  and 2013  net of tax of 203 million and 39 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2014  approximately 20  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 78  of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from customers during 2013  approximately 19 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 74 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper sales these agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales recycling commodity hedges for a discussion of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013  see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

we had no outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2014  the aggregate fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013  were current assets of 03 million  and current liabilities of 06 million  and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portion of the change in fair value of our recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013  net of tax of 02 million has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

for 2014  and 2013  approximately 6  and 24 of our sales volume of commodities were subject to cash flow hedges respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  in millions 



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2014  for variable rate debt the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2014  

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2014  

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

debt covenants 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2014  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2015  

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of 

financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2015  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than operating leases and financial assurances which are not classified as debt we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations we have not guaranteed any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the following table calculates our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in millions of dollars   

for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities  contained elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures the following table reconciles property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  as follows in millions of dollars 



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that presenting free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric 

used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  note 10 income taxes  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

 54 

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 23 in 2014 and 25 in both 2013 and 2012 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 45 in 2014 50 in 2013 and 475 in 2012 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods timing of expenditures the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies

 insurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance programs for workers compensation commercial general and auto liability environmental and remediation liability and employeerelated health care benefits are subject to high deductible insurance policies accruals for insurance or deductible reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 30 million to 50 million

loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists we test goodwill for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments east central and west in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 3  to 5  2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40  3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7  and 8  and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2014  we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control 

as of december 31 2014  we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 50  on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

 income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties 

related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

residual risks 

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our employee benefits committee as of december 31 2014 the plan assets were invested in fixed income funds equity funds and cash the employee benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary as of december 31 2014  the plan was underfunded by 42 million compared to overfunded by 81 million as of december 31 2013  

residual risk 

 assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 23 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 27 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation 

increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned there are no participants in the plan that continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement”   



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 627 million  additionally during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 the goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2014  our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 26 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 25 million  per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

our fuel costs were 5000 million  in 2014 or 57  of revenue compared to 5167 million in 2013 or 61 of revenue and 5301 million in 2012 or 65 of revenue 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our recycling centers market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 28 million  and 16 million  respectively 

revenue from sales of these products in 2014  2013  and 2012  was approximately 3908 million  3746 million  and 3490 million  respectively

business 

tableend overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 336  collection operations in 39 states and puerto rico we own or operate 199  transfer stations 190  active solid waste landfills and 69  recycling centers we also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

based on an industry trade publication the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 55 billion of which approximately 45 is recognized by publicly owned waste companies industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 35 and 20 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

we manage our operations through three geographic operating regions that are also our reportable segments east central and west each region is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our regions and all of our operating areas provide collection transfer recycling and landfill services we believe this structure facilitates integrating our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy it also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while minimizing administrative overhead costs and maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments

our local management teams have extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities each regional management team includes a region president vice president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe our strong regional management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions areas and business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe we have created a company with a strong national operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal during the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 68  of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate internalization our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority and it is profitable to do so 

growth initiatives 

our growth initiatives are designed to deliver total waste stream solutions to our customers while creating sustainable economic value for our stockholders we believe focusing on the following growth initiatives will improve profitability and generate value for our stockholders 

internal growth 

within our markets our goal is to deliver sustainable longterm profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return we allocate capital to businesses markets and development projects both to support growth and to achieve acceptable rates of return the key components of our internal growth strategy are 

price growth we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in vehicles equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling facilities 

volume growth we believe waste volumes are driven by population growth household formation and new business formation volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste under residential collection contracts with municipalities exclusive franchise agreements as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets in addition by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue we are better able to protect our market position from competition we work to increase volumes while ensuring that prices charged for services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

sales and marketing activities and national accounts we manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate while most of our marketing activity is local in nature we also employ a national accounts selling organization in response to the needs of national and regional customers the national accounts team is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts team centralizes certain services like customer support and billing to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize costs with our extended geographic reach this team effectively serves our customers nationwide 

acquisitions and publicprivate partnerships 

our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies we also will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies we expect to maintain a steady pace of acquisition investment of approximately 100 million annually 

we also focus on the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governmental authorities for growth opportunities we believe our ability to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing is growing as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

expansion of recycling capabilities 

we believe approximately 26 of municipal solid waste is recycled communities have increasingly committed to their residents to enhance and expand their recycling programs we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices we currently own or operate 69  recycling centers during 2013 we invested approximately 30 million to develop and upgrade our recycling centers we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our recycling capabilities in markets where these services are desired and provide an appropriate return on our investment 

development activities 

we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated where appropriate we obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate return on investment of capital where operations are not generating acceptable returns we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through integrating additional assets if such enhancements are not possible we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

cost control initiatives 

our cost control initiatives are designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in the most efficient productive and environmentally sound way possible 

fleet automation 

approximately 66 of our residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we reduce labor costs improve driver productivity and create a safer work environment for our employees additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng 

approximately 12 of our fleet operates on natural gas we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng our preferred alternative fuel technology as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 50 of our replacement vehicle purchases during 2013 were cng vehicles we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission objectives or initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront costs are higher we expect that using natural gas will reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses 

standardized maintenance 

based on an industry trade publication we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2013 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality while extending the service life of our fleet we believe operating a more reliable safer and efficient fleet will lower our operating costs we have completed implementation of standardized maintenance programs for approximately 45 of our fleet maintenance operations as of december 31 2013 

cash utilization strategy 

key components of our cash utilization strategy include increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for a discussion and reconciliation of free cash flow you should read the free cash flow section of our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in item 7 of this form 10k 

we believe free cash flow drives shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes investments in acquisitions and returning a majority of free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade rating 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities as well as by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

dividends 

in july 2003 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 004 per share our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter the latest increase occurring in july 2013 to 026 per share representing a compound annual growth rate since 2003 of 206 and a 106 increase over that of the prior year we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance stockholder value 

share repurchases 

we have had a share repurchase program since november 2010 from november 2010 to december 31 2013 we used  10392 million to repurchase 355 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost per share of 2930  in october 2013 the board of directors added 650 million to the existing share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2013 there was 7606 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization during 2014 we expect to use approximately 400 million of our authorization to repurchase our outstanding shares of common stock 

strong capital structure 

since our merger with allied on december 5 2008 we have refinanced 52882 million in senior notes and 12062 million in taxexempt financings this reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and taxexempt financings on a weighted average basis by more than 175 basis points while extending our debt maturities and giving greater stability to our capital structure as a result of the refinancing our debt maturity and revolver capacity profile is as follows 

a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s bbb by fitch and baa3 by moody’s as of december 31 2013 such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operations 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and recovering and recycling certain materials 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 336  collection operations in 2013 77  of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 34  of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 40  is from services provided to commercial customers and 26  is from services provided to industrial both permanent and temporary and other customers 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential solid waste collection services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste to either a transfer station or directly to a landfill for disposal 

we also provide recycling services based on our collection customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services we own or operate 199  transfer stations revenue at transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for approximately 5  of our revenue during 2013 our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional gate to extend their geographic reach 

when our own collection operations use our transfer stations this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to thirdparty disposal sites it also allows us to manage costs associated with waste disposal because 1 transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks allowing us to deliver more waste to the landfill in each trip 2 waste is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency and 3 we can retain volume by managing the waste to one of our own landfills rather than to a competitor’s 

landfill services we own or operate 190  active landfills we charge tipping fees to third parties which accounted for approximately 12  of our revenue during 2013 as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 37000 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of 49 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

we also have responsibility for 124  closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services we own or operate 69  recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ old newspaper onp aluminum glass and other materials which accounted for approximately 4  of our revenue during 2013 approximately 70 of our recycling center volume relates to occ onp and other mixed paper of the 47 million tons we sold during 2013 22 million moved through our recycling centers and 25 million we collected and delivered to third parties 

changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 31 million  and 19 million  respectively 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recyclable materials a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recyclable materials at thirdparty facilities 

as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

we continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers for example advanced sorting equipment such as disk screens magnets and optical sorters identifies and separates different kinds of paper metals plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts 

other services other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators thus substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

competition 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions also tend to increase during the summer months our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our strong regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

  

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

  

 cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

   

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past two years the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty tucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 the epa and the nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 the epa and the nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pickup trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 the epa and the nhtsa finalized standards for heavyduty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 in issuing the fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks and tractor trailers the government estimated the standards would increase the cost of the average tractortrailer by approximately 6200 but that the vehicle would save fuel costs over its operating life 

  

 state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been considered or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations  section of our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in item 7 of this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including damages to the environment property employees or the general public although we focus on operating safely and prudently we occasionally receive claims alleging damages negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work which resulted in harm to the environment property employees or the general public these liabilities can be significant we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements we maintain various policies of insurance that subject to limitations exclusions deductibles or self insurance provide coverage for these types of claims while we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business we can neither assure you that such insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows we also cannot assure you that we would continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive 

accruals for self insurance or deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased selfinsurance or deductible retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we also purchase surety bonds insurance policies letters of credit or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 7 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing commercial and industrial accounts in general and the manufacturing and construction industries in particular we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the weak us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill from time to time our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 5167 million  in 2013 or 61  of revenue compared to 5301 million in 2012 or 65 of our revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2013 approximately 19  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers for 2013 we were able to recover approximately 74  of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 20 million  accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that the epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 the epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must contain renewable fuels as designated by regulation the total volume metrics for each year vary based upon a number of factors eg the availability of such fuels and it is difficult to predict the ultimate quantity that the epa will eventually mandate for 2014 and beyond these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2013 approximately 24  of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 31 million  and 19 million  respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the epa projecting a 4° to 11° fahrenheit temperature increase in the united states by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of these factors could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure or postclosure costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions the epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority the epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and the epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet the epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards the epa and the nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 we cannot assure you that federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavyduty vehicles will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as it relates to stationary sources of greenhouse gases in may 2010 the epa finalized the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations based upon such sources total greenhouse gas emissions recent efforts to challenge the tailoring rule before the us court of the appeals for the district of columbia the dc circuit have failed most recently a federal appellate court decision has called into question certain regulatory deferrals that had been established for biogenic carbon dioxide emissions including those from landfills the dc circuit struck down the epa’s july 2011 rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to biogenic carbon emissions at this time it is uncertain what action the epa will take with respect to regulating the biogenic carbon emissions from the management of municipal solid waste we cannot assure you that the eventual application of the tailoring rule to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment arising from our operations or properties we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar state laws or rcra in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

  

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results may differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation multiemployer pension plans employee benefit plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions selfinsurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 26  of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert managements attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse impact on us 

we contribute to 26 multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 20  of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa except as discussed in note 11 employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

a cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners we also rely on a payment card industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information while the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in item 8 of this form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue our operations are in 39  states and puerto rico we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 336  collection operations we own or operate 199  transfer stations 190  active solid waste landfills and 69  recycling centers we also operate 69  landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was 84172 million  compared to 81183 million for 2012 this 37  increase in revenue was made up of increases in average yield of 13  fuel recovery fees of 03  and acquisitions net of divestitures of 05  as well as increases in volume of 13  and recycling commodities increases of 03  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  

our pretax income was 8512 million  8239 million and 9063 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 5889 million  or 162  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 5718 million or 155 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2012  and 5892 million or 156 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2011  

during each of the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we recorded a number of charges and other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ cost of operations ” “ selling general and administrative expenses ” and “ income taxes ” discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings 

  



we believe that presenting adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods in the case of the bridgeton remediation charges we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results however in the ordinary course of our business we often incur remediation adjustments that we do not adjust from our operating results our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

negotiation and withdrawal costs  central states pension and other funds  during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  we recorded charges to earnings of  1577 million  and  358 million  respectively primarily related to our negotiation and withdrawal liability from the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund also included within these charges to earnings for 2013  is 21 million for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute related to our operations in puerto rico as well as costs of 170 million 51 million in 2012 related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements under which we had obligations to contribute to the fund 

restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of 2012 we announced a restructuring of our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes included consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels during the years ended december 31 2013   and 2012  we incurred  86 million  and  111 million  respectively of restructuring charges which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with noncancellable lease agreements 

loss on extinguishment of debt  during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we completed various refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase outstanding debt as well as noncash charges for unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

bridgeton remediation   we recorded environmental remediation charges at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri of  1087 million  in june 2013 and  741 million  during 2012 to manage the remediation area and monitor the site 

tax valuation allowance adjustment   during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reduced our valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards due to our determination that it is more likely than not a portion of these carryforwards would be utilized in future years 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net  for a more detailed discussion of the components of this see our “ gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2014 guidance 

in 2014 we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital we are committed to an efficient capital structure maintaining our investment grade rating and increasing cash returns to our stockholders 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2014 specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2014 revenue to increase by approximately 35 to 45 comprised of the following 

  



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual service revenue of these restricted pricing arrangements 

  

 the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition the initial impact of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

diluted earnings per share 

we expect 2014 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 193 to 198 

property and equipment net 

in 2014 we anticipate receiving approximately 820 million of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment as follows

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer station services landfill disposal and recycling our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

  



the following table reflects changes in our revenue for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  as compared to the previous year 



in 2013 we conformed the terms we use to describe components of price in an effort to better align with industry participants we have not changed our calculation methodology but we believe use of these terms allows for consistent comparison across the industry average yield which we formerly referred to as core price is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service expressed as a percentage we now use core price to mean price increases to customers and fees excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases to retain customers 

revenue – 2013 compared to 2012 

the increase in revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 is due to the following 

   

 

 

 

changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 31 million  and 19 million  respectively 

revenue – 2012 compared to 2011 

the decrease in revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the following 

 31 

 

 

 cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel tax credits disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance leachate disposal remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs risk management which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

  



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

cost of operations  2013 compared to 2012 

our cost of operations increased 2290 million or as a percentage of revenue 05 in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily as a result of the following 

 at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 20 million  per year 

 cost of operations – 2012 compared to 2011 

our cost of operations increased 1406 million or as a percentage of revenue 23 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily as a result of the following 

 

 depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2013 compared to 2012 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in aggregate dollars increased 240 million primarily due to higher costs of residential side loaders for automating our residential collection routes and an increased number of cng vehicles which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational over the past several quarters depreciation and amortization of property and equipment as a percentage of revenue remained relatively consistent at 65 for 2013 and 64 for 2012 

landfill depletion and amortization expense in aggregate dollars increased 43 million primarily due to increased landfill disposal volumes as well as an overall increase in our average depletion rate offsetting these increases were favorable amortization adjustments of 03 million that were recognized in 2013 relative to asset retirement obligations compared to net unfavorable adjustments of 49 million in 2012 landfill depletion and amortization as a percentage of revenue remained relatively consistent at 31 for 2013 and 32 for 2012 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment  2012 compared to 2011 

depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased 94 million for 2012 primarily due to higher costs of residential side loaders and an increased number of cng vehicles in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational in 2012 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased 21 million primarily due to unfavorable adjustments to landfill depletion and amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 49 million recorded during 2012 compared to favorable adjustments of 96 million recorded during 2011 offsetting the increase in costs relative to asset retirement obligations was an overall decline in landfill depletion due to lower disposal volumes 

amortization of other intangible assets and other assets 

expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were 707 million 701 million and 767 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively or as a percentage of revenue 08 for 2013 and 09 for 2012 and 2011 our other intangible assets and other assets primarily relate to customer lists franchise agreements municipal contracts trade names now fully amortized in 2013 favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars decreased during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to municipal agreement intangibles acquired from allied that are now fully amortized 

accretion expense 

accretion expenses were 766 million 784 million and 780 million or as a percentage of revenue 09 10 and 09 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively accretion expenses have remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties legal settlements marketing investor and community relations services directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges restructuring charges are excluded from selling general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately below 

the following table provides the components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2013 compared to 2012 

salaries increased 60 million but remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue at 65 and 66 for 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2013 we recorded severance costs due to management departures and higher salaries payroll taxes and benefits resulting from merit increases and management incentive pay partially offset by lower salaries expense in connection with the reorganization 

provision for doubtful accounts decreased 136 million and 02 of revenue primarily due to a net favorable adjustment recorded in our corporate segment of 83 million resulting from a change in our estimated future bad debts 

other selling general and administrative expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue increased 405 million and 03 respectively these increases are primarily related to charges for legal settlements of 296 million for 2013 which relate to legal matters occurring in the ordinary course of business as compared to net favorable legal settlement adjustments of 37 million for 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2012 compared to 2011 

salaries decreased 02 million and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue for 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease is primarily due to lower management incentive pay due to our revised financial expectations offset by merit wage increases and the expansion of our sales team in the second half of 2011 

provision for doubtful accounts increased due to an increase in unrecoverable amounts from certain customers and the recovery during 2011 of accounts previously writtenoff 

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 130 million or as a percentage of revenue 01 primarily as a result of a decrease in legal fees and settlements and consulting and professional fees partially offset by higher recruiting and relocation expenses 

negotiation and withdrawal costs  central states pension and other funds 

during 2013 we recorded charges to earnings of 1577 million primarily related to our negotiation costs of 170 million and our withdrawal liability from the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund of 1386 million also included in the 1577 million of charges for 2013 is 21 million for withdrawal events at the multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute related to our operations in puerto rico during 2012 we recorded charges to earnings of 358 million primarily related to our negotiation costs of 51 million and our partial withdrawal liability from the fund of 307 million the payments associated with any withdrawal liability ordinarily would be due in installments over a period of 20 years and the payments are unlikely to be material to our cash flow in any particular period 

for additional discussion and detail regarding our obligations to the fund see our central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund discussion in note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net 

during 2013 we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of 19 million primarily related to contingent sale price of 10 million received during the first quarter of 2013 in connection with a 2011 business divestiture in our west region and the disposal of a business in one market in our west region which resulted in a gain of 09 million and proceeds of 17 million 

during 2012 we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of 27 million primarily due to a 55 million net gain on a divestiture of a collection business in our east region and a sale of certain assets associated with our rail logistics business proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were 96 million during 2012 

during 2011 we disposed of businesses in various markets resulting in a gain of 210 million in connection with the dispositions we closed a landfill resulting in an asset impairment charge of 287 million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping closure and postclosure obligations additionally we recorded asset impairments of 204 million primarily related to certain longlived assets that are held for sale and losses on the divestiture of certain businesses and related goodwill proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were 142 million during 2011 

restructuring charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes include consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels during 2013 and 2012 we incurred 86 million and 111 million of restructuring charges respectively which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with noncancellable lease agreements substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment and were incurred as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 18 million  remains accrued for severance and other employee termination benefits and lease exit costs 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and selffunded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition in millions of dollars 

  



the decrease in interest expense and accretion of debt discounts for 2013 compared to 2012 and for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to refinancing certain of our higher interest rate debt in 2012 beginning august 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million and resulted in a 20 million reduction in interest expense during 2013 during 2013 2012 and 2011 cash paid for interest was 3240 million  3410 million  and 3962 million  respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the following table summarizes the refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to 

repurchase outstanding debt as well as noncash charges for unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions of dollars 



income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 2621 million 2518 million and 3174 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our effective income tax rate was 308 306 and 350 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our 2013 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately 42 million for adjustments to our valuation allowance for state loss carryforwards primarily due to our determination that it is more likely than not that a portion of these loss carryforwards will be utilized in future periods in addition our 2013 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division and the joint committee of taxation during the first quarter of 2013 for tax years 2009 and 2010 this settlement benefited our 2013 tax provision by approximately 14 million due to the reversals of previously accrued tax and interest 

our 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division for tax years 2004 to 2008 this settlement benefited our 2012 tax provision by approximately 35 million due to the reversals of previously accrued tax and interest in 2011 our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division for tax years 2000 to 2003 this settlement favorably impacted our 2011 tax provision by approximately 23 million due to reversals of previously accrued tax and interest 

in addition our 2013 2012 and 2011 tax provisions were favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately 96 million 160 million and 190 million respectively 

we made income tax payments net of refunds received of approximately 288 million 185 million and 173 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

income taxes paid in 2013 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the american tax relief act of 2012 signed into law on january 2 2013 this legislation extended 50 bonus depreciation for property placed in service during 2013 and helped mitigate the negative impact from the lack of property deductions due to bonus depreciation taken in prior years 

income taxes paid in 2012 and 2011 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 tax relief act that was signed into law in december 2010 the tax relief act included 100 bonus depreciation for property placed in service after september 8 2010 and through december 31 2011 and 50 bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2012

reportable segments 

our operations are managed and evaluated through three regions east central and west these three regions are presented below as our reportable segments the historical results discussion and presentation of our reportable segments for all periods presented reflect the impact of the restructuring of our operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 these reportable segments provide integrated waste management services consisting of collection transfer recycling and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources corporate accounts closed landfills and other administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments for 2013 compared to 2012 and 2012 compared to 2011 are discussed in the following paragraphs 

2013 compared to 2012   

east region 

revenue for 2013 increased 04 from 2012 primarily due to average yield and volume increases in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business and an average yield increase in our landfill line of business these increases were partially offset by declines in volume in our residential collection landfill and transfer station lines of business the volume declines in our residential collection line of business were primarily due to the loss of certain municipal contracts and volume decreases in our disposal lines of business were primarily related to the loss of certain disposal contracts 

operating income in our east region decreased from 4746 million for 2012 or a 194 operating margin to 4510 million for 2013 or an 184 operating margin primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 

 

central region 

revenue for 2013 increased 36 from 2012 primarily due to average yield and volume increases in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business increased volumes in our residential collection line of business increased municipal solid waste landfill volume and increased average yield for our disposal lines of business these increases were partially offset by declines in transfer station volumes 

operating income in our central region increased from 4745 million for 2012 or a 196 operating margin to 4945 million for 2013 or a 197 operating margin primarily as a result of the following 

 

 west region 

revenue for 2013 increased 53 from 2012 primarily due to increases in average yield and volume in substantially all core lines of business volume increases in the landfill line of business were primarily due to increased special waste event work 

operating income in our west region increased from 6859 million for 2012 or a 217 operating margin to 7666 million for 2013 or a 231 operating margin primarily as a result of the following 

 

 corporate entities 

during 2013 the corporate entities had operating losses of 5018 million compared to 3144 million for 2012 operating losses for 2013 were adversely impacted by a 1087 million charge recorded in connection with remediation at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri as compared to 741 million of charges recorded in 2012 a charge to earnings of 1407 million during 2013 for our withdrawal liability from the fund and puerto rico multiemployer pension plans as compared to 307 million of charges recorded in 2012 and certain legal settlement charges in 2013 of 313 million 

2012 compared to 2011   

east region 

revenue for 2012 declined 32 primarily due to declines in volume in our collection landfill and transfer station lines of business coupled with lower recycling commodity revenue and decreases in average yield in our collection line of business the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and the loss of certain disposal contracts these decreases were partially offset by price increases in the landfill and transfer station lines of business during 2012 

operating income in our east region decreased from 5507 million for 2011 or a 218 operating margin to 4746 million for 2012 or a 194 operating margin in addition to the impact of the decrease in revenue the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 

 

 

 central region 

revenue for 2012 declined 02 primarily due to a decline in volumes in our transfer station and landfill lines of business and a decline in recycling commodity revenue as a result of decreases in commodity prices the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and special waste event work not recurring in 2012 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in average yield in all lines of business and volume increases in all collection lines of business during 2012 

operating income in our central region decreased from 5293 million for 2011 or a 218 operating margin to 4745 million for 2012 or a 196 operating margin primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 41 

west region 

revenue for 2012 increased 06 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and an increase in volumes in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business these increases were partially offset by a decline in volumes in our residential collection landfill and transfer station lines of business as well as lower recycling commodity revenue the volume decline in our landfill line of business was primarily due to competitive disposal pricing and special waste event work not recurring in 2012 

operating income in our west region decreased from 7359 million for 2011 or a 234 operating margin to 6859 million for 2012 or a 217 operating margin primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 

 corporate entities 

during 2012 the corporate entities had an operating loss of 3144 million compared to an operating loss of 2632 million for 2011 

the operating loss for 2012 was favorably impacted by lower management incentive pay lower legal fees and lower consulting expenses these favorable adjustments were more than offset by unfavorable remediation adjustments due to a 741 million charge recorded in connection with environmental conditions at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri and adjustments to asset retirement obligations totaling 133 million at other closed landfills in addition during 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of 358 million primarily related to negotiation costs and our partial withdrawal from central states pension fund 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company we incurred 111 million of restructuring charges that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with noncancellable lease agreements with terms ranging from two to five years 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  





  



changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2013  we owned or operated 190  active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 49 billion  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2013  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 47 billion  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 02 billion  inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates  section of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2013  nine  of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these nine landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 53 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 66 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2013    



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2013  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10913 million  of which 936 million  are current and 9977 million  are longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10k 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

bridgeton landfill in june 2013 we recorded an environmental remediation charge at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri of 1087 million to manage the remediation area and monitor the site as of december 31 2013 the remediation liability recorded for this site is 939 million  of which 309 million  is expected to be paid during the next twelve months we believe the remaining reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 630 million  to 3420 million  

countywide landfill  in september 2009 republic services of ohio ii llc entered into final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december 31 2013 is 470 million of which 46 million is expected to be paid during the next twelve months we believe the remaining reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 46 million to 67 million 

congress landfill  in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2013 is 827 million of which 99 million is expected to be paid during the next twelve months we believe the remaining reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 53 million to 153 million 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2013 in millions 

  





  

  





the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  



during 2013 and 2012 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on a threeyear historical moving average 

as of december 31 2013 we expect to spend an estimated additional  75 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  108 billion  or  222  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

property and equipment 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions of dollars   









  



  



liquidity and capital resources

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures decreased our cash flow from operations by 3770 million in 2012 compared to a decrease of 4069 million in 2011 a decrease of 299 million primarily as a result of the following 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 cash flows used in investing activities 

the most significant items affecting our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

   

 

 we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we primarily expect to use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions 

cash flows used in financing activities 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows from financing activities for the periods presented are summarized below 

 

 

 

 

financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2013 we had  2133 million  of cash and cash equivalents and  1697 million  of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 219 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 560 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills and 884 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our selffunded insurance obligations 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs

in may 2012 we amended and restated our 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due september 2013 the amended and restated credit facility to extend the maturity to may 2017 the amended and restated credit facility includes a feature that allows us to increase availability at our option by an aggregate amount up to 500 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders at our option borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements 

contemporaneous with the execution of the amended and restated credit facility we entered into amendment no 1 to our existing 125 billion unsecured credit facility the existing credit facility and together with the amended and restated credit facility the credit facilities to reduce the commitments under the existing credit facility to 10 billion and conform certain terms of the existing credit facility to those of the amended and restated credit facility amendment no 1 does not extend the maturity date under the existing credit facility which matures in april 2016 

in connection with entering into the amended and restated credit facility and amendment no 1 to the existing credit facility the guarantees by our subsidiary guarantors of the amended and restated credit facility and the existing credit facility were released as a result the guarantees by our subsidiary guarantors of all of republics outstanding senior notes were automatically released in addition the guarantees by all of our subsidiary guarantors other than allied waste industries inc and allied waste north america inc of the 9250 debentures and the 7400 debentures issued by our subsidiary browningferris industries llc successor to browningferris industries inc also were automatically released 

as of december 31 2013  we had no borrowings under our credit facilities as of december 31 2012  we had 250 million  of eurodollar rate borrowings at an interest rate of 132  our credit facilities also are subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments regardless of usage availability under our credit facilities can be used for working capital capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes we had 7221 million  and  9094 million  of letters of credit using availability under our credit facilities leaving 15279 million  and  13156 million  of availability under our credit facilities as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities as of december 31 2013  

the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2013  our ebitda to interest ratio was 641 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 303 compared to the 375 maximum allowed by the covenants in july 2013 we amended our credit facilities to allow for our maximum total debt to ebitda ratio not to exceed 375 for each of the fiscal quarters ending june 30 2013 september 30 2013 december 31 2013 and march 31 2014 and 350 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2014  

ebitda which is a nonus gaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

in march 2012 we entered into a 750 million uncommitted unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility bearing interest at libor plus an applicable margin in july 2012 we amended the uncommitted credit facility to increase the size to 1250 million with all other terms remaining unchanged our uncommitted credit facility is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with certain covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time as of december 31 2013  we had no borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility as of december 31 2012  we had 139 million of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility at an interest rate of 135 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the noncash charges for unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in june 2012 we issued 8500 million of 3550 senior notes due 2022 the 3550 notes the 3550 notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations we used the net proceeds from the 3550 notes to fund the redemption of our subsidiary allied waste north america incs 7500 million 6875 senior notes maturing in 2017 and for general corporate purposes 

in august 2011 our 6750 senior notes matured and we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 3870 million  of principal due on these notes 

in may 2011 we issued 7000 million  of 3800  senior notes due 2018 the 3800 notes 5500 million  of 4750  senior notes due 2023 the 4750 notes and 6000 million  of 5700  senior notes due 2041 the 5700 notes together with the 3800 notes and the 4750 notes the 2011 notes we used the net proceeds from the 2011 notes as follows a 6214 million  to fund the redemption of our 6000 million   7125  senior notes maturing in 2016 b 816 million  to purchase 592 million  of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 9250  debentures maturing in 2021 c 2218 million  to purchase 1807 million  of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 7400  debentures maturing in 2035 d 6190 million  to repay borrowings under our credit facilities and e the remainder for general corporate purposes in may 2011 our 6375  senior notes matured and we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2169 million  of principal due on these notes 

in february 2011 our 5750  senior notes matured and we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2629 million  of principal due on these notes 

interest rate swap agreements 

during the second half of 2013 we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4750 fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023 these transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing costs and rebalancing our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates as of december 31 2013 our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 3000 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4750 for the year ended december 31 2013 net interest received from the swaps was 20 million these swap agreements mature in may 2023 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had 10877 million  and 10975 million  respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2038 approximately 85 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield certain of these variable rate taxexempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

as of december 31 2013  we had 1697 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 219 million  represented proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2013 see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were current assets of 67 million  and 31 million  respectively and current liabilities of 01 million  and 04 million  respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2013 and 2012 net of tax of 39 million and 16 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2013 approximately 19  of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 74  of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers during 2012 approximately 8 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 67 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from the sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper sales these agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales recycling commodity hedges for a summary of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013 see note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregate fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were current assets of 03 million  and 10 million  respectively and current liabilities of 06 million  and 12 million  respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values of our recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2013 and 2012 net of tax of 02 million and 01 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

for 2013 and 2012 approximately 24  and 41 of our sales volume of commodities were subject to cash flow hedges respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 in millions 

  



scheduled interest payment obligations in the above table were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable as of december 31 2013 for variable rate debt the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps on the interest payments of our 4750 fixed rate senior notes is also included based on the floating rates in effect as of december 31 2013 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2013 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

debt covenants 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2013 we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2014 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies the financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2014 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is calculated as follows in millions of dollars 

  



for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities  section contained elsewhere in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 is as follows in millions of dollars 

  



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our contingencies see note 10 income taxes  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

  

 

 56 

landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 57 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

  

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

  

 

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 25 in both 2013 and 2012 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 50 in 2013 and 475 in 2012 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

  

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

  

 environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied which were initially estimated on a discounted basis are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance programs for workers compensation commercial general and auto liability environmental and remediation liability and employeerelated health care benefits are either selfinsured or subject to high deductible insurance policies accruals for selfinsurance or deductible reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 20 million to 50 million 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks

asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

  

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

  

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists we test goodwill for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments east central and west in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 2 to 4 2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40 3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7 and 8 and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2013 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 

as of december 31 2013 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 40 on average and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

we will continuously monitor market trends in our business the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill additionally we would then be required to review our remaining longlived assets for impairment 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment

 income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

during the three months ended december 31 2013 we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our deferred tax asset related to certain state loss carryforwards this resulted in a reduction to our valuation allowance for these loss carryforwards of approximately 435 million significant factors used in our determination of the 435 million include

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee as of december 31 2013 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash the retirement benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary as of december 31 2013 the plan was overfunded by 81 million compared to our unfunded benefit obligation of 61 million as of december 31 2012 

residual risk 

  

 

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 20 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 24 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” 

  



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 818 million  additionally we entered into various interest rate swap agreements with the goal of reducing overall borrowing costs and rebalancing our debt portfolios ratio of fixed to floating interest rates these swap agreements which were designated as fair value hedges have a total notional value of 3000 million as of december 31 2013 our interest rate swap contracts have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new fuel hedges renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

at current consumption levels we believe a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 25 million  per year offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 20 million  per year 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our recycling centers market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a 10 per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 31 million  and 19 million  respectively 

revenue from sales of these products in 2013  2012  and 2011  was approximately 3746 million  3490 million  and 4386 million  respectively

business 

tableend overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 332 collection operations in 38 states and puerto rico we own or operate 195 transfer stations 191 active solid waste landfills and 71 recycling centers we also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 on december 5 2008 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of allied waste industries inc allied in a stockforstock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 121 billion which included 54 billion of debt at fair value 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 55 billion of which approximately 60 is managed by publicly owned waste companies we believe that we and one other public waste company generated in excess of 60 of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue industry data also indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 19 and 22 respectively of total industry revenue we believe growth in the solid waste industry historically has been linked primarily to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer 

we manage our operations through three geographic operating regions that are also our reportable segments east central and west each region is organized into several areas and each area contains multiple business units or operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe this structure facilitates integrating our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy it also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while minimizing administrative overhead costs and maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes included consolidating the regions from four to three which resulted in a change to our reportable segments to those described above and areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels we implemented this realignment to leverage our strong leadership team and organizational capabilities to refine how we operate we have not made any changes to the span of control at our business units keeping the appropriate leadership focus and decision making closest to our customers 

management team 

we believe we have one of the most experienced management teams in the solid waste industry 

donald w slager became our chief executive officer ceo and remained our president on january 1 2011 after having served as our president and chief operating officer coo from the allied acquisition in december 2008 until then in addition to his duties as ceo mr slager resumed the role of principal operating executive from november 2011 until august 2012 prior to the allied acquisition mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations mr slager held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 32 years of experience in the solid waste industry mr slager has been a member of our board of directors since june 24 2010 

glenn a culpepper was elected executive vice president  chief financial officer effective on january 9 2013 mr 

culpepper has more than 30 years of broadbased financial experience he joins republic from summit materials a leading business in the aggregates and building materials sector where he has been chief financial officer cfo for the last two years prior to that mr culpepper spent 21 years at crh plc a large publiclytraded multinational construction materials company based in dublin ireland including two years as its principal financial officer and member of its board of directors and 13 years as the cfo of its north american operations oldcastle materials prior to crh mr culpepper held roles of increasing responsibility in audit tax and mergers and acquisitions at price waterhouse

jeffrey a hughes was named executive vice president human resources in december 2008 before that mr hughes served as senior vice president eastern region operations for allied from 2004 until the allied acquisition in december 2008 mr hughes served as assistant vice president of operations support for allied from 1999 to 2004 and as a district manager for allied from 1988 to 1999 mr hughes has over 25 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

michael p rissman has served as our executive vice president general counsel and corporate secretary since august 2009 previously mr rissman had served as acting general counsel and corporate secretary from march 2009 mr rissman joined allied as vice president and deputy general counsel in july 2007 and continued in the same positions at republic following the allied acquisition in december 2008 prior to joining allied mr rissman was a partner at mayer brown llp in chicago where he worked from 1990 until coming to allied in 2007 

our local management team has extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities each regional management team includes a regional president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions areas and business units throughout our operations to continue improving operating margins 

integrated operations 

we believe we have created a company with a strong national operating platform we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through processing or disposal our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority and it is profitable to do so we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volumes 

we also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations in markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 67 of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization in a number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities flow control this provides us with an opportunity to compete effectively in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 

major initiatives 

our initiatives are designed to deliver total waste stream solutions including recycling to our customers while creating sustainable economic value for our stockholders we believe focusing on the following major initiatives will improve profitability and generate value for our stockholders 

customer experience 

we strive to provide the highest level of customer service our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer service and satisfaction we also have municipal marketing representatives who are responsible for working with municipalities or communities to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction additionally the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 

we will continue to exceed our customers’ expectations through consistently delivering high quality service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to do business with us our technology eventually will allow more customers to access information and perform functions like changing service requests and making payments over the internet that were previously done with the assistance of a customer service representative by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our webbased market presence we believe we will enhance customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs 

expansion of recycling capabilities 

we believe approximately 35 of municipal solid waste is recycled communities have increasingly committed to their residents to enhance and expand their recycling programs we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices we currently own or operate 71 recycling centers during 2012 we invested approximately 76 million on five recycling centers we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our recycling capabilities in markets where these services are desired and provide an appropriate return on our investment 

fleet automation 

through 2012 we have converted approximately 62 of our residential routes to automated single driver trucks by converting our residential routes to automated service we believe we can more efficiently service our customers improve driver safety increase productivity and reduce labor costs additionally communities using automated vehicles have higher participation rates in recycling programs thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities 

fleet conversion to compressed natural gas cng 

we currently operate 1300 cng vehicles out of our total 15000 active vehicles we expect to continue our gradual fleet conversion to cng our preferred alternative fuel technology as part of our ordinary annual fleet replacement process we believe a gradual fleet conversion is most prudent to realize the full value of our previous fleet investments approximately 54 of our vehicle purchases during 2012 were vehicles fueled by cng we believe using cng vehicles provides us a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission objectives or initiatives that focus on protecting the environment although upfront costs are higher we expect that using natural gas will reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower maintenance and fuel expenses 

standardized maintenance 

we believe we operate the eighth largest vocational fleet in the united states as of december 31 2012 our average fleet age in years by line of business was as follows 



we have historically spent approximately 5 of our revenue on fleet maintenance through standardization of core functions we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes resulting in higher vehicle quality and reliability and a safer more efficient fleet with lower operating costs we have standardized maintenance programs for approximately 50 of our fleet maintenance operations through december 31 2012 

cash utilization strategy 

key components of our cash utilization strategy include generating and growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes 

  

 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued landfill and environmental costs 

internal growth and acquisitions 

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal growth in price and volume as well as through development activities acquisitions and improving our operating margins within our markets our goal is to deliver sustainable longterm profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return we allocate capital to businesses markets and development projects both to support growth and to achieve acceptable rates of return the key components of our growth strategy are 

price growth we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in vehicles other equipment landfills transfer stations and recycling facilities 

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means to grow our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste with exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we can grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets in addition by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue we are better able to protect our market position from competition we work to increase volumes while ensuring that prices charged for services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

sales and marketing activities we manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate while most of our marketing activity is local in nature we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of national and regional customers this national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize costs with our extended geographic reach this program effectively serves our customers nationwide as an industry leader our mission is to use our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling centers and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital where operations are not generating acceptable returns we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through integrating additional assets if such enhancements are not possible we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

acquisitions our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held solid waste and recycling companies that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies in addition we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies 

publicprivate partnerships    in addition to privately held solid waste and recycling companies we also focus on the waste and recycling operations and facilities of municipal and other local governmental authorities for growth opportunities we believe our ability to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing is growing as they increasingly seek to raise capital and reduce risk 

the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations whether through acquisitions or publicprivate partnerships reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories and backoffice administration 

dividends 

in july 2003 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 004 per share our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2012 to 0235 per share representing a compound annual growth rate since 2003 of approximately 22 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance stockholder value 

share repurchases 

we have had a share repurchase program since november 2010 from november 2010 to december 31 2012 we used 8256 million to repurchase 290 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average cost per share of 2849 we expect to use the remaining authorization totaling 3244 million to repurchase outstanding shares during 2013 

strong capital structure 

debt since our merger with allied on december 5 2008 we have refinanced 52882 million in senior notes and 10223 million in taxexempt financings this reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and taxexempt financings on a weighted average basis by more than 175 basis points while extending our debt maturities and giving greater stability to our capital structure as a result of the refinancing our debt maturity profile is as follows 



credit ratings a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s bbb by fitch and baa3 by moody’s as of december 31 2012 such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates 

operations 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and recovering and recycling certain materials 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 332 collection operations in 2012 77 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 35 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 40 is from services provided to commercial customers and 25 is from services provided to industrial both permanent and temporary and other customers 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills or recycling centers we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights 

to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential solid waste collection services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market collection frequency type of equipment furnished type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs and the cost of disposal 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste to either a transfer station or directly to a landfill for disposal 

we also provide recycling services based on our collection customers requirements to complete our service offerings 

transfer services we own or operate 195 transfer stations revenue at transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees which accounted for 5 of our revenue during 2012 our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfill sites with an additional “gate” to extend their geographic reach 

disposal services we own or operate 191 active landfills we charge tipping fees to third parties which accounted for 12 of our revenue during 2012 as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 37000 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of 48 billion  inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

we also have responsibility for 128 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services we own or operate 71 recycling centers these facilities generate revenue through the collection processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ old newspaper onp aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are collected by our collection operations 

changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 29 million and 20 million respectively on an annual basis 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recyclable materials a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recyclable materials at thirdparty facilities 

of the current waste stream approximately 35 is recycled and we believe that percentage is growing faster than the overall waste stream as more volumes are diverted from landfills as consumer demand for recycling services has increased we have met that demand by integrating recycling components to each of our collection service offerings our goal is to provide a complete waste stream management solution to our customers in an environmentally sustainable way 

other services other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators thus substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

customers 

we provide services to a broad base of commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no single customer has individually accounted for more than 3 of our consolidated revenue in any of the last three years 

competition 

although we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies including waste management inc several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate among other things the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines penalties or settlements we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

  

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include 

landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

  

 cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability any such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

would also apply to landfill gas emissions see item 1a risk factors  – “ regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate ” in this form 10k 

in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past two years epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards epa and nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty tucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 epa and nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 epa and nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pickup trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 epa and nhtsa finalized standards for heavy duty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 in issuing the fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks and tractor trailers the government estimated the standards would increase the cost of the average tractortrailer by approximately 6200 but that the vehicle would save fuel costs over its operating life 

  

 state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the us supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number 

of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations table within item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”  contained elsewhere in this form 10k for further information 

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

we maintain commercial general and auto liability employment practices liability environmental and remediation liability directors and officers liability workers compensation and employers liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our insurance programs for workers compensation commercial general and auto liability environmental and remediation liability and employeerelated health care benefits are either selfinsured or subject to large deductible insurance policies claims in excess of selfinsurance or deductible levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased selfinsurance or deductible retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we purchase performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash and marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts financial assurance for closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making deposits in the form of cash or marketable securities or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

employees 

we work to create and maintain an environment that attracts develops and retains people who assure our success with customers differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to be an employer of choice for top talent as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 30000 fulltime employees approximately 26 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees and the communities we serve our longstanding commitment to safety is unwavering we will continue to improve our driver safety training program and reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner in all our lines of business

risk factors 

tableend this form 10k contains certain forwardlooking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” provided by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are statements that are not historical facts words such as “guidance” “expect” “will” “may” “anticipate” “plan” “estimate” “project” “intend” “should” “can” “likely” “could” “outlook” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements include statements about our plans strategies and prospects forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of performance these statements are based upon our managements current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties including the risks set forth below in these risk factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied or projected by the forwardlooking information and statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct according you should not place undue reliance on the forwardlooking statements which speak only as of the date of this form 10k except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form 10k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 7 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing commercial and industrial accounts in general and the manufacturing and construction industries in particular we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the weak us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors as a result of these factors from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries adverse weather and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees our fuel costs were 5301 million in 2012 or 65 of revenue compared to 5165 million in 2011 or 63 of our revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2012 approximately 8 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers for 2012 we were able to recover approximately 67 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 24 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 19 million accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements and separate volume 

requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must be renewable and must take into account the fuels impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs petrochemical prices and hence our operating and capital costs may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2012 approximately 41 of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 29 million and 20 million respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions including those brought about by climate change may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change some of which we may already be experiencing recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected with the world bank now projecting a 72° fahrenheit temperature increase by the end of the century in addition to sea level rise this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts floods and other extreme weather events any of this could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will 

increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the landfills permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated if our capping closure or postclosure costs exceed the amounts accrued or if such accruals are required to be accelerated this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidate balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in 

the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the collection treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging nuisance environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress our landfill operations emit methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleet emits among other things carbon dioxide which also is a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme courts april 2007 massachusetts v epa  ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and epas december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare with respect to our light and heavyduty vehicle fleet epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards epa and nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavyduty vehicles through modelyear 2018 and to lightduty vehicles through modelyear 2025 we cannot assure you that federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of lightduty and heavy duty vehicles will not have a material effect on our operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as it relates to stationary sources of greenhouse gases in may 2010 epa finalized the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations recent efforts to challenge the tailoring rule before the us court of the appeals for the district of columbia have failed nonetheless in july 2011 epa issued a rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to biogenic carbon emissions from solid waste landfills for three years which largely exempts landfills from the tailoring rule during this period we cannot assure you however that the eventual application of the tailoring rule to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar state laws or rcra in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or to expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

  

 

 

 

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities when we can by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that will differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on managements estimates actual results will differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation employee benefit and pension plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 26 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or our withdrawal from such plans may have an adverse impact on us 

we contribute to 27 multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering unionrepresented employees approximately 20 of our total current employees participate in such multiemployer plans we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa except as discussed in the following four paragraphs and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements employee benefit plans we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 

further under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a withdrawal event we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plans unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have cbas with local bargaining units of the teamsters under which we have obligations to contribute to the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund all of these cbas have been are or will be under negotiation in the remainder of 2013 as part of our negotiations we have proposed or intend to propose to withdraw from the fund withdrawal is only one of the issues in these negotiations and we do not know what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations in any locale will be with respect to each cba if we do withdraw this will constitute a withdrawal event and will require us to make payments to the fund for a proportionate share of its unfunded vested liabilities 

during 2012 we had withdrawal events with respect to two of our facilities based on information provided to us by the fund our actuarial calculations and a number of other variable factors including our estimated number of 2013 contribution based units we have estimated our liability to the fund associated with these two withdrawal events will be approximately 31 million which was charged to earnings during the three months ended september 30 2012 

if we do have an additional withdrawal event or events with respect to one or more of the remaining bargaining units the amount ultimately payable would depend upon a number of variable factors involving valuations and actuarial calculations we do not presently know what the result of those calculations and valuations would be however we believe our additional liability upon a complete withdrawal from the fund would be between 113 million and 146 million if it were to occur in 2013 based on current estimates in the future a loss may become probable at which time or times we will incur an expense that will reduce earnings any such expense may be material to our results of operations in the period or periods incurred 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 332 collection operations in 38 states and puerto rico we own or operate 195 transfer stations 191 active solid waste landfills and 71 recycling centers we also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was 81183 million compared to 81929 million for the same period in 2011 this 09 decrease in revenue was made up of increases in core price of 08 fuel surcharges of 01 and acquisitions net of divestitures of 04 that were more than offset by decreases in volumes of 10 and recycling commodities of 12 

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  

our pretax income was 8239 million 9063 million and 8770 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our net income attributable to republic services inc was 5718 million or 155 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 5892 million or 156 per diluted share in 2011 and 5065 million or 132 per diluted share in 2010 

during each of the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded a number of charges and other expenses and benefits that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ cost of operations ”  selling general and administrative expenses  and  income taxes  discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings 

  



we believe the presentation of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain nonoperational items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

negotiation and withdrawal costs  central states pension fund  during the year ended december 31 2012 we incurred costs related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements under which we have obligations to contribute to the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund during 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of 358 million primarily related to our partial withdrawal from the fund 

loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we completed refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase outstanding debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

costs to achieve synergies during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan that are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses these incremental costs primarily relate to our synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs we did not incur any such expenses during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

restructuring charges during the year ended december 31 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes include consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred restructuring and integration charges related to the allied acquisition these charges consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees we completed the allied restructuring plan in 2010 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net for more detailed discussion of the components of these costs see our “gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

2013 guidance 

our objectives for 2013 remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and efficiently using free cash flow we remain committed to continuing our broadbased pricing initiatives 

across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in 2013 specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2013 revenue to increase by approximately 20 to 25 this consists of the following 

  



changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual revenue these restrictions include 

  

 of these restricted pricing arrangements approximately 60 are based on a consumer price index 15 are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index such as the consumer price index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31 2013 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap 



this 2013 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 38 we expect cash taxes as a percentage of the overall tax provision to be 90  100 at this time we are unable to estimate the magnitude or timing of charges associated with our loss on extinguishment of debt negotiation and withdrawal costs from collective bargaining agreements under which we have obligations to contribute to the central states pension fund or gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which is not a measure determined in accordance with u s gaap provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain nonoperational items such as those detailed in the above table we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the 

ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

property and equipment 

in 2013 we anticipate receiving approximately 860 million of property and equipment as follows 

  



purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2013 are expected to be approximately 880 million the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is approximately 20 million of property and equipment received during 2012 but paid for in 2013 

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer stations landfill disposal and recycling our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer stations landfills and to a lesser extent our recycling centers generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials other noncore revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

  



the following table reflects the percentage changes in our revenue for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 



revenue – 2012 versus 2011 

the decrease in revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the following 

 

 

 

 

changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 29 million and 20 million respectively on an annual basis 

revenue – 2011 versus 2010 

the increase in revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to the following 

  

   

 

 

 

 cost of operations 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel credits disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes financial assurance remediation costs leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs risk management which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

  



the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies thus you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

cost of operations – 2012 versus 2011 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased 23 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 

at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 24 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 19 million 

 

 

 

these increases in costs were partially offset by 

 

 33 

 cost of operations – 2011 versus 2010 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased 06 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the following 

  

 

 

 

these increases were partially offset by 

  

 

 

 depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased 94 million for 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to higher costs of residential side loaders for automating our residential collection routes and an increased number of cng vehicles which are more expensive than diesel vehicles in addition we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational in 2012 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased 21 million for 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments to landfill depletion and amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 49 million recorded during 2012 versus favorable adjustments of 96 million recorded during 2011 offsetting the increase in costs relative to asset retirement obligations was an overall decline in landfill depletion due to lower disposal volumes as previously noted in our revenue  

2012 versus 2011 discussion 

landfill depletion and amortization expense increased in aggregate dollars slightly during 2011 versus 2010 due to increased volumes year over year 

amortization of other intangible and other assets 

expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were 701 million 767 million and 715 million or as a percentage of revenue 09 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists franchise agreements municipal contracts trade names favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars decreased during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to municipal agreement intangibles acquired from allied that are now fully amortized 

accretion expense 

accretion expenses were 784 million 780 million and 805 million or as a percentage of revenue 10 09 and 10 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the amounts have remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties marketing investor and community relations directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges 

the following table provides the components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies thus you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2012 versus 2011 

our salaries expenses decreased 02 million and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue for 2012 versus 2011 the decrease is primarily due to lower management incentive pay due to our revised financial expectations offset by merit wage increases and the expansion of our sales team in the second half of 2011 

provision for doubtful accounts increased due to an increase in unrecoverable amounts from certain customers and the recovery during 2011 of accounts previously writtenoff 

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 131 million or as a percentage of revenue 01 for 2012 versus 2011 primarily as a result of a decrease in legal fees and settlements and consulting and professional fees partially offset by higher recruiting and relocation expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2011 versus 2010 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased 326 million for 2011 versus 2010 or 05 as a percentage of 

revenue selling general and administrative expenses include an accrual for synergy bonus related to the allied acquisition of approximately 33 million in 2010 in 2011 we did not incur any additional costs to achieve synergies 

negotiation and withdrawal costs  central states pension fund 

during 2012 we incurred costs related to the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements under which we have obligations to contribute to the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund and charges for our partial withdrawal from the fund we expect to incur these types of additional charges in 2013 however at this time we are unable to estimate the magnitude or timing of these charges for 2013 during 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of 358 million primarily related to our partial withdrawal from the fund the payments associated with any withdrawal liability ordinarily would be due in installments over a period of 20 years and the payments are unlikely to be material to our cash flow in any particular period 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of 27 million primarily due to a 55 million net gain on a divestiture of a collection business in our east region and a sale of certain assets associated with our rail logistics business proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were 96 million during 2012 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we disposed of businesses in various markets resulting in a gain of 210 million including transaction costs in connection with the dispositions we closed a landfill resulting in an asset impairment charge of 287 million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping closure and postclosure obligations additionally we recorded asset impairments of 204 million primarily related to certain longlived assets that are held for sale and losses on the divestiture of certain businesses and related goodwill proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were 142 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

we divested certain assets throughout 2010 resulting in a net loss on disposition of assets of 40 million including transaction costs additionally we recorded an impairment loss of 151 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used 

restructuring charges 

during 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company these changes include consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20 relocating office space and reducing administrative staffing levels during 2012 we incurred 111 million of restructuring charges which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancellable terms ranging from 2 to 5 years we expect to incur approximately 15 million of additional expense during 2013 related to such activities substantially all of these charges were or will be recorded in our corporate segment and we expect the remaining charges will be paid primarily during 2013 we expect this restructuring will reduce our selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 23 million annually 

during 2010 we incurred 114 million of restructuring and integration charges related to the integration of allied which consisted of charges and adjustments for severance employee termination and relocation benefits the remainder of the charges primarily related to consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment we completed our restructuring plan in 2010 and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges related to the allied acquisition in 2011 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and selffunded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition in millions 

  



the decrease in interest expense and accretion of debt discounts is primarily due to refinancing certain of our higher interest rate debt following the allied acquisition during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 cash paid for interest was 3410 million 3962 million and 4178 million respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

the following table summarizes the refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to 

repurchase outstanding debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions 



income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 2518 million 3174 million and 3695 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our effective income tax rate was 306 350 and 421 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division of allieds federal tax years 2004  2008 this settlement benefited our 2012 tax provision by approximately 35 million due to the reversals of previously accrued tax and interest in 2011 our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division of allieds federal tax years 2000  2003 this settlement favorably impacted our 2011 tax provision by approximately 23 million due to reversals of previously accrued tax and interest 

in addition our 2012 and 2011 tax provisions were favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately 16 million and 19 million respectively 

during 2012 we did not dispose of any goodwill without corresponding tax basis during 2011 and 2010 we incurred charges of 71 million and 131 million respectively for dispositions of goodwill that had no corresponding tax basis and thus were nondeductible for tax purposes 

we made income tax payments net of refunds received of 185 million 173 million and 418 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively income taxes paid in 2012 and 2011 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 tax relief act that was signed into law in december 2010 the tax relief act included 100 bonus depreciation for property placed in service after september 8 2010 and through december 31 2011 and for certain longterm construction projects to be placed in service in 2012 and 50 bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2012 and for certain longterm construction projects to be placed in service in 2013 income taxes paid in 2010 includes 111 million related to the settlement of certain tax liabilities regarding

reportable segments 

our operations are managed through three geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments the historical results discussion and presentation of our reportable segments as set forth in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the impact of the realignment of our operating structure in the fourth quarter of 2012 summary financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

  



corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other typical administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing 2012 to 2011 and 2011 to 2010 are discussed in the following paragraphs 

2012 compared to 2011   

east region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 declined 32 due primarily to declines in volume in our collection landfill and transfer station lines of business coupled with lower recycling commodity revenue and price decreases in our collection line of business the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and the loss of certain disposal contracts these decreases were partially offset by price increases in the landfill and transfer station lines of business for 2012 

operating income margin in our east region decreased from 218 in 2011 to 194 in 2012 or 24 in addition to the impact of the decrease in revenue the following cost categories impacted operating income 

 

 

 

 central region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 declined 02 primarily due to a decline in volumes in our transfer station and landfill lines of business and a decline in recycling commodity revenue as a result of decreases in commodity prices the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and special waste event work not recurring in 2012 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in core price growth in all lines of business and volume increases in all collection lines of business for the year ended december 31 2012 

operating income margin in our central region decreased from 218 in 2011 to 196 in 2012 or 22 primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 west region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 06 due to an increase in core price in all lines of business and an increase in volumes in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business these increases were partially offset by a decline in volumes in our residential collection landfill and transfer station lines of business as well as lower recycling commodity revenue the volume declines in our landfill line of business were primarily due to competitive disposal pricing and special waste event work not recurring in 2012 

operating income margin in our west region decreased from 234 in 2011 to 217 in 2012 or 17 primarily as a result of the following 

 

 

 

 corporate entities 

during the year ended december 31 2012 the corporate entities had an operating loss of 3144 million versus a loss of 2632 million for 2011 

the operating loss for the year ended december 31 2012 was favorably impacted by lower management incentive pay lower legal fees and lower consulting expenses these favorable adjustments were more than offset by unfavorable remediation adjustments due to a 741 million charge recorded in connection with environmental conditions at a closed disposal facility in missouri and adjustments to asset retirement obligations totaling 133 million at other closed landfills in addition during 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of 358 million primarily related to our partial withdrawal from central states pension fund 

in october 2012 we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company we incurred 111 million of restructuring charges that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with noncancellable terms ranging from 2 to 5 years 

2011 compared to 2010 

east region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 declined 04 primarily due to volume decreases offset by increases in core price recycling commodity revenue and fuel recovery fees in addition revenue for 2011 declined as a result of business divestitures 

operating margin in our east region decreased 16 from 234 in 2010 to 218 in 2011 as a result of the following 

 

 

 central region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 30 due to core price and fuel recovery fee growth and an increase in recycling commodity revenue these increases were partially offset by volume declines in our residential collection transfer station and disposal lines of business in part due to the expiration of the city of toronto transportation and disposal contract 

operating income margin in our central region decreased 14 from 232 in 2010 to 218 in 2011 as a result of the following 

 

 

 west region 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 08 due to core price and fuel recovery fee growth and an increase in recycling commodity revenues the increases were partially offset by volume declines in all lines of business primarily due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract 

operating income margin in our west region decreased 05 from 239 in 2010 to 234 in 2011 as a result of the following 

 

 

 

corporate entities

during 2011 we recorded a gain on the disposition of assets and impairments of 12 million versus an impairment loss of 144 million related to certain longlived assets that were held and used for 2010 

during 2010 we incurred 333 million of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan and 114 million of restructuring and integration charges related to our acquisition of allied operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher litigation and management incentive plan costs 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the 

site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

available airspace 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  



  



  



changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 

as of december 31 2012  we owned or operated 191 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 48 billion  inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted 

airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2012  total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 46 billion  inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 02 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

as of december 31 2012  ten of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 55 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 64 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2012  

  



final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2012  accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10524 million  of which 1104 million  is current and 9420 million  is longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

in december 2009 we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied or a predecessor company that it had acquired had been identified as a potentially responsible party the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring see also note 2 summary of significant accounting policies – environmental remediation liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 975 discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

missouri closed landfill during 2012 we encountered certain environmental issues at a closed landfill in missouri during 2012 we recorded a charge of 741 million to manage the remediation area as well as future monitoring of the site the remediation liability for this site is  642 million  as of december 31 2012 of which  145 million  is expected to be paid during 2013 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is  50 million  to  240 million  

countywide landfill in september 2009 republic services of ohio ii llc entered into final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december 31 2012  is 524 million  of which 44 million  is expected to be paid during 2013  we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 50 million  to 71 million  

congress landfill in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2012  is 834 million  of which 75 million  is expected to be paid during 2013  we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 53 million  to 153 million  

investment in landfills 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2012 in millions 

  



  



  





the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  



during 2012 our average compaction rate was approximately 2000 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average as compared to 1900 pounds per cubic yard for 2011 our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

as of december 31 2012 we expect to spend an estimated additional  72 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be  105 billion  or  217  per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method

as of december 31 2012  and 2011 the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was 132  and 325  respectively our credit facilities also are subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments regardless of usage availability under our credit facilities can be used for working capital capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had 250 million  and 344 million  of base rate  prime and eurodollar rate borrowings respectively we had 9094 million  and 9502 million of letters of credit using availability under our credit facilities leaving 13156 million  and 15154 million of availability under our credit facilities at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively 

in march 2012 we entered into a new 750 million uncommitted unsecured credit facility agreement the uncommitted credit facility bearing interest at libor plus an applicable margin in july 2012 we amended the uncommitted credit facility to increase the size to 1250 million with all other terms remaining unchanged as of december 31 2012  the interest rate for our borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility was 135 our uncommitted credit facility also is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement regardless of usage we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with certain covenants the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time 

as of december 31 2012  we had 139 million  of libor borrowings 

the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity as of december 31 2012 our ebitda to interest ratio was 587 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 309 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2013 

ebitda which is a nongaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

senior notes and debentures 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in june 2012 we issued 8500 million of 3550 senior notes due 2022 the 3550 notes the 3550 notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations we used the net proceeds from the 3550 notes to fund the redemption of our subsidiarys allied waste north america inc 7500 million 6875 senior notes maturing in 2017 and for general corporate purposes 

in august 2011 our 6750 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 3870 million  of principal due on these notes 

in may 2011 we issued 7000 million  of 3800  senior notes due 2018 the 3800 notes 5500 million  of 4750  senior notes due 2023 the 4750 notes and 6000 million  of 5700  senior notes due 2041 the 5700 notes together with the 3800 notes and the 4750 notes the 2011 notes we used the net proceeds from the 2011 notes as follows a 6214 million  to fund the redemption of our 6000 million   7125  senior notes maturing in 2016 b 816 million  to purchase 592 million  of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 9250  debentures maturing in 2021 c 2218 million  to purchase 1807 million  of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 7400  debentures maturing in 2035 d 6190 million  to repay borrowings under our credit facilities and e the remainder for general corporate purposes in may 2011 our 6375  senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2169 million  of principal due on these notes 

in february 2011 our 5750  senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2629 million  of principal due on these notes 

in november 2010 our 650 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2216 million  of principal due on these notes 

in march 2010 we issued 8500 million  of 500 senior notes due 2020 the 2020 notes with an unamortized discount of 01 million  at december 31 2010 and 6500 million  of 620 senior notes due 2040 the 2040 notes and together with the 2020 notes the 2010 notes we used the net proceeds from the 2010 notes as follows a 4337 million  to redeem the 6125 senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102042   4250 million  principal outstanding b 6218 million  to redeem the 7250 senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103625   6000 million  principal outstanding and c the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had 10975 million  and 11264 million  respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2013 to 2037 approximately 85 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield certain of these variable rate taxexempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

as of december 31 2012  we had 1642 million  of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 247 million  represented proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a detailed listing of our outstanding fuel hedges during 2012 and 2011 see note 15 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges at december 31 2012 and 2011 were current assets of 31 million and 16 million respectively and current liabilities of 04 million and 47 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2012 and 2011 net of tax of 16 million and 18 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2012 approximately 8 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we were able to recover approximately 67 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted occ and onp sales the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales recycling commodity hedges for a detailed listing of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges during 2012 and 2011 see note 15 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges at december 31 2012 and 2011 were current assets of 10 million and 14 million respectively and current liabilities of 12 million and 07 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values of our recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2012 and 2011 net of tax of 01 million and 04 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

approximately 41 of our 2012 sales volume of commodities was subject to cash flow hedges 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 in millions 

  



we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated 

or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2012 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of 1 disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and 2 other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

debt covenants 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2012 we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2013 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies the financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2013 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is calculated as follows in millions 

  



for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities  contained elsewhere in this form 10k 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is as follows in millions 

  



the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our contingencies see note 10 income taxes  and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

  

 

 

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

  

 landfill development asset amortization to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

  

 

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at 

estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 25 in both 2012 and 2011 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 475 in 2012 and 60 in 2011 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 57 

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

  

 environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of 

allied that were recorded at estimated fair value environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance programs for workers compensation commercial general and auto liability environmental and remediation liability and employeerelated health care benefits are either selfinsured or subject to large deductible insurance policies accruals for selfinsurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 20 million to 50 million 

residual risks 

  

 

 

 loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

  

 

 

•        new claims may be asserted that are not included in our loss contingencies 

asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

residual risk 

  

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

  

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists we test goodwill for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments east central and west in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include 1 estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 2 to 3 2 future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40 3 future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital 4 estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7 and 8 and 5 the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and c estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include 1 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 2 an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 3 a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold 4 continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit 5 a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or 6 the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2012 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 

as of december 31 2012 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of approximately 30 to 40 and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

we will continuously monitor market trends in our business the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill additionally we would then be required to review our remaining longlived assets for impairment 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

  

 

 income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee at december 31 2012 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash we annually review and adjust the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was 61 million as of december 31 2012 compared to 399 million as of december 31 2011 

residual risk 

  

 

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 26 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 31 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” 

  



the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 797 million  

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new or renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

at current consumption levels a twentycent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 24 million on an annual basis offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers at current participation rates a twentycent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately 19 million 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our recycling centers market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 29 million and 20 million respectively on an annual basis 

revenue from sales of these products in 2012 2011 and 2010 was approximately 3490 million  4386 million and 3379 million respectively

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 334 collection operations in 39 states and puerto rico we own or operate 194 transfer stations 191 active solid waste landfills and 74 materials recovery facilities we also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 on december 5 2008 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of allied waste industries inc allied in a stockforstock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 121 billion which included 54 billion of debt at fair value 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 54 billion of which approximately 60 is generated by publicly owned waste companies we believe that we and one other public waste company generated in excess of 60 of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue additionally industry data indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 17 and 22 respectively of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we can drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer we implement this strategy through an organizational structure that groups our operations within a corporate region area and division structure we manage our operations through four geographic operating regions that are also our reportable segments eastern midwestern southern and western each of our regions is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple divisions or operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe this structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy it also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

we had revenue of 82 billion 81 billion and 82 billion and operating income of 16 billion 15 billion and 16 billion for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively a number of items impacted our 2011 2010 and 2009 financial results for a description of these items see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and consolidated results of operations in this form 10k 

we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our operating and cash utilization strategies we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics including increasing free cash flow achieving targeted earnings and maintaining and improving returns on invested capital our operating and cash utilization strategies are described further below 

  

operating strategy 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing these goals includes the following 

 

  

  

  

 experienced executive management team 

we believe we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry 

donald w slager became our ceo and remained our president on january 1 2011 after having served as our president and chief operating officer coo from the allied acquisition in december 2008 until then mr slager resumed the role of principal operating executive in november 2011 prior to the allied acquisition mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations mr slager held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 31 years of experience in the solid waste industry mr slager has been a member of our board of directors since june 24 2010 

tod c holmes has served as our chief financial officer since august 1998 mr holmes served as our vice president of finance from june 1998 until august 1998 and as vice president of finance of our former parent company’s solid waste group from january 1998 until june 1998 from 1987 to 1998 mr holmes served in various management positions with browningferris industries inc including vice president investor relations from 1996 to 1998 divisional vice president collection operations from 1995 to 1996 divisional vice president and regional controller – northern region from 1993 to 1995 and divisional vice president and assistant corporate controller from 1991 to 1993 mr holmes has over 24 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

jeffrey a hughes was named executive vice president human resources in december 2008 before that mr hughes served as senior vice president eastern region operations for allied from 2004 until allied’s merger with republic in december 2008 mr hughes served as assistant vice president of operations support for allied from 1999 to 2004 and as a district manager for allied from 1988 to 1999 mr hughes has over 24 years of experience in the solid waste industry

our regional senior vice presidents have an average of 26 years of experience in the industry 

  

decentralized management structure 

we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to more efficiently manage our daytoday operations our local management has extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets this allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities each regional management team includes a senior vice president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets compensation for area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager’s geographic area of responsibility in addition through longterm incentive programs including stock options we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions areas and divisions throughout our operations to continue improving operating margins 

strong integrated operating platform 

we believe we have created a company with a strong national operating platform we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through diversion to our materials recovery facilities for processing or disposal our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations transfer stations and landfills we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volumes 

we also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations in markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 66 67 and 68 respectively of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization in a number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities flow control this provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity 

our priorities and major initiatives to generate cash value 

our priorities are designed to deliver total waste stream solutions including recycling to our customers while creating sustainable economic value for our stockholders we believe focusing on the following priorities and major initiatives will improve profitability and generate value for our stockholders 

 

  

   

  

 we will continue to invest in our vehicles other equipment landfills recycling and other facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve in addition we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices 

we will continue to exceed our customers’ expectations through consistently delivering high quality service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to do business with us our technology eventually will allow more customers to access information and perform functions like changing service requests and making payments over the internet that were previously done with the assistance of a customer service representative by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our webbased market presence we believe we will enhance customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 for certain risks related to our operating strategy see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k  

cash utilization strategy 

key components of our cash utilization strategy include generating and growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our cash utilization strategy which includes 

 

  

  

  

   

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

internal growth and acquisitions 

within our markets our goal is to deliver sustainable longterm profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return we allocate capital to businesses markets and development projects both to support growth and to achieve acceptable rates of return we develop previously nonpermitted materials recovery facilities transfer stations and landfills we also expand our existing materials recovery facilities transfer stations and landfills when possible we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets such as landfills transfer stations materials recovery facilities and tuckin acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital where operations are not generating acceptable returns we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through integrating additional assets if such enhancements are not possible we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets 

share repurchases 

in august 2011 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through december 31 2013 this authorization is in addition to the 400 million repurchase program authorized in november 2010 from november 2010 to december 31 2011 we used 5008 million under these programs to repurchase 171 million shares at a weighted average cost per share of 2921 we expect to use the remaining funds totaling 6492 million to repurchase our outstanding shares of common stock throughout 2012 and 2013 

dividends 

in july 2003 our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 004 per share our quarterly dividend has increased from time to time thereafter the latest increase occurring in the third quarter of 2011 to 022 per share representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 24 we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance stockholder value 

strong capital structure 

debt following our december 5 2008 allied acquisition we initiated a debt reduction program that to date has resulted in a net reduction in borrowings of 08 billion funded by cash flow from operations and proceeds from disposition of assets we also refinanced 45 billion in senior notes and 8694 million in taxexempt financings which reduced the average coupon rate on our senior notes and taxexempt financings on a weighted average basis by more than 155 basis points while extending our debt maturities and giving greater stability to our capital structure we anticipate taking further advantage of capital market opportunities to mitigate our financial risk by issuing new debt and using the proceeds to repay existing debt early extinguishment of debt will result in a charge in the period in which the debt is repaid 

credit ratings we believe that a key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining investment grade ratings on our senior debt which was rated bbb by standard  poor’s bbb by fitch and baa3 by moody’s as of december 31 2011 such ratings have allowed us and should continue to allow us to readily access capital markets at competitive rates our cash utilization strategy will continue to focus on maintaining our investment grade credit ratings 

for certain risks related to our cash utilization strategy see item 1a risk factors in this form 10k 

  

operations 

our operations primarily consist of providing collection transfer station and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste and the recovery and recycling of certain materials 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 334 collection operations in 2011 75 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 35 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 40 is from services provided to commercial customers and 25 is from services provided to industrial and other customers 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills we typically perform residential solid waste collection services under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods we also perform residential solid waste collection services on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators we typically perform commercial collection services under one to threeyear service agreements and we determine fees by considerations such as market factors collection frequency type of equipment furnished the type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs the distance and cost of disposal 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste to either a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

transfer services we own or operate 194 transfer stations and in 2011 transfer services accounted for 5 of our revenue revenue at transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fee our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or materials recovery facilities essentially transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfill sites with an additional “gate” to extend the geographic reach of a particular landfill site with the goal of increased internalization 

disposal services we own or operate 191 active landfills we charge tipping fees to third parties and in 2011 disposal services accounted for 13 of our revenue we had approximately 37000 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 48 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs 

  

remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

we also have responsibility for 130 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

recycling services we own or operate 74 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations these facilities generate revenue through the collection processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard occ old newspaper onp aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential and industrial collection operations 

changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million and 18 million respectively on an annual basis 

in certain instances we issue recycling rebates to municipalities or large industrial customers which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recyclable materials a fixed contractual rate or other measures we also receive rebates when we dispose of recyclable materials at thirdparty facilities 

other services other revenue consists primarily of national accounts revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

sales and marketing 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction our business is derived from a broad customer base which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

our sales and marketing strategy provides highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

while most of our marketing activity is local in nature we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of national and regional customers this national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize costs with our extended geographic reach this program effectively serves our customers nationwide as industry leaders our mission is to use our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 

historically we have not always changed the trade names of the local businesses we acquired and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name 

customers 

we provide services to a broad base of commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no single customer has individually accounted for more than 3 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

  

competition 

although we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publiclyowned companies including waste management inc several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

seasonality and severe weather 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

regulation 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 

   

 subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the implementation of federal environmental requirements by state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

 cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

   

  

 in addition our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbonemission restrictions over the past two years epa and the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions the regulations take the form of fuel economy standards epa and nhtsa have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories 1 conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks and 2 heavyduty tucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers we own and operate vehicles in both categories for conventional automobiles and lightduty trucks in may 2010 epa and nhtsa finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016 in october 2011 epa and nhtsa initiated a second round of rulemaking for conventional automobiles and pickup trucks in model years 2017 through 2025 in august 2011 epa and nhtsa finalized standards for heavy duty trucks including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers for model years 2014 through 2018 in issuing the fuel economy standards for heavyduty trucks and tractor trailers the government estimated the standards would increase the cost of the average tractortrailer by approximately 6200 but that the vehicle would save fuel costs over its operating life 

 

 state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have 

  

adopted similar laws and regulations in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to spend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdiction lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional in 2007 however the us supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publiclyowned and publiclyoperated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may in some cases cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us refer to the contractual obligations

liability insurance and bonding 

the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

we maintain general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers’ liability workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

in the normal course of business we post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 30000 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements from time to time our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business our management believes we have good relations with our employees

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 7 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 

our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control including consumer confidence and interest rates a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated which adversely affects our revenues in addition we have a relatively high fixedcost structure which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services requested by our customers additionally the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing commercial and industrial accounts in general and the manufacturing 

  

and construction industries in particular we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy accordingly we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the weak us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts industrial customers and others 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts or industrial clients to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on price geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors as a result of these factors from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues it could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs including fuel and environmental costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases we also may lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war 

  

terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees for example our fuel costs were 5165 million in 2011 or 63 of our revenue compared to 4076 million in 2010 or 50 of our revenue 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2011 approximately 4 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers for 2011 we were able to recover approximately 68 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees at our current consumption levels a onecent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by 14 million on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles the renewable fuel standards that epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses pursuant to the energy independence and security act of 2007 epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements and separate volume requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel advanced biofuel cellulosic biofuel and biomassbased diesel these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners’ or importers’ total fuel volume that must be renewable and must take into account the fuels’ impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 

our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range during 2011 approximately 33 of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements at our current sales levels a ten dollar per ton change in the sale price of recyclable materials changes our revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million and 18 million respectively on an annual basis accordingly a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change any of this could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

  

we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future if we were unable to do so our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 

our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing initiatives that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or increase them or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we spend on capital capping closure postclosure environmental remediation and other items will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate new landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our nonhazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

if we do not appropriately estimate the cost of landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material 

  

financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income additionally if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting and recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills further many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal such as recycling and composting while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate many of the largest companies in the us are setting zerowaste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills although such actions help to protect our environment they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows further even if we can develop service offerings and lines of business disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 

in accordance with us gaap we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion acquisition and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidate balance sheets which we must assess for impairment annually and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

complying with laws and regulations governing the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

  

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and may in the future continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to be debated on the federal regional and state level our landfill operations emit methane identified as a greenhouse gas and our vehicle fleets emit among others carbon dioxide which also has been identified as a greenhouse gas conventional wisdom now suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme court’s april 2007 massachusetts v epa ruling that greenhouse gases are “pollutants” for purposes of the clean air act and epa’s december 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare one applicable rule is epa’s may 2010 prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations epa’s authority to issue the tailoring rule has been challenged in court and the outcome of that court challenge is uncertain moreover in july 2011 epa issued a rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to solid waste landfills for three years we cannot assure you that eventual application of the tailoring rule to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

  

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar state laws or rcra in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

we are and from time to time become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain further the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates thus we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

  

 if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

  

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities when we can by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each sellers of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that will differ from actual results 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on management’s estimates actual results will differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation employee benefit and pension plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance 

we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 27 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 

we contribute to at least 27 multiemployer pension plans covering at least 20 of our current employees we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have 

  

not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period furthermore under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a “withdrawal event” we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see note 11 employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects

overview 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 334 collection operations in 39 states and puerto rico we own or operate 194 transfer stations 191 active solid waste landfills and 74 materials recovery facilities we also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 81929 million compared to 81066 million for the same period in 2010 core price for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 08 fuel recovery fees increased 10 commodity revenue increased 10 and acquisitions net of divestitures increased 01 offsetting this revenue growth of 29 were decreases of 14 due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the city of toronto effective december 31 2010 and 04 from volume declines 

the following table summarizes our operating revenue costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 pretax income was 9063 million 8770 million and 8650 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively net income attributable to republic services inc was 5892 million or 156 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 5065 million or 132 per diluted share in 2010 and 4950 million or 130 per diluted share in 2009 

  

during each of the three years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded a number of gains charges recoveries and other expenses that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table in millions except per share data additionally see our “ income taxes ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

 loss on extinguishment of debt during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we completed refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase outstanding debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

costs to achieve synergies during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we incurred incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan that are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses these incremental costs primarily relate to our synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs we did not incur any such expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 we expect to pay amounts earned under the synergy incentive plan during the first quarter of 2012 

restructuring charges during the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we incurred restructuring and integration charges related to the allied acquisition these charges consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment we completed our restructuring plan in 2010 and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges related to the allied acquisition in 2011 

remediation recoveries net during 2009 we recovered 120 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility which were partially offset by additional charges of 52 million at our closed disposal facility in california 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net for more detailed discussion of the components of these costs see our “ loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net ” discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we believe the presentation of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our 

  

operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

2012 guidance 

our objectives for 2012 remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and efficiently using free cash flow we remain committed to continuing our broadbased pricing initiatives across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in 2012 specific guidance follows 

revenue 

we expect 2012 revenue to increase by approximately 15 to 20 this consists of the following 

 

 changes in price are restricted on approximately 50 of our annual revenue these restrictions include 

 

   of these restricted pricing arrangements approximately 65 are based on a consumer price index 20 are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index such as the consumer price index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

adjusted diluted earnings per share 

the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2012 which are not measures determined in accordance with gaap excluding loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

   

we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes loss on extinguishment of debt provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use this measure and believe investors will find it helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

during 2012 we expect to call and refinance 7500 million of our june 2017 6875 senior notes as of december 31 2011 the unamortized discount associated with these notes was 758 million early extinguishment of the notes will result in an impairment charge in the amount of the unamortized note discount as well as any premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase 

property and equipment 

in 2012 we anticipate receiving approximately 860 million of property and equipment as follows 

 

 purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2012 are expected to be approximately 920 million the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is approximately 60 million of property and equipment received during 2011 but paid for in 2012

landfill depletion and amortization increased in aggregate dollars slightly during 2011 due to increased volumes year over year the decrease in landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for 2010 versus 2009 is due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes and assets divested as required by the doj depreciation and amortization of property and equipment as a percentage of revenue has remained consistent for 2011 2010 and 2009 

amortization of other intangible and other assets 

expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were 767 million 715 million and 706 million or as a percentage of revenue 09 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists franchise agreements municipal contracts trade names favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars increased slightly during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to increased acquisition activity 

accretion expense 

accretion expense was 780 million 805 million and 888 million or as a percentage of revenue 10 for 2011 and 2010 and 11 for 2009 the amounts have remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties marketing investor and community relations directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges 

the following table provides the components of our selling general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies thus you should take care when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2011 versus 2010 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 326 million for 2011 versus 2010 or 05 as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses include an accrual for synergy bonus related to the allied acquisition of approximately 33 million in 2010 in 2011 we did not incur any additional costs to achieve synergies 

  

selling general and administrative expenses – 2010 versus 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 224 million for 2010 versus 2009 and as a percentage of revenue remained consistent with 2009 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net of costs to sell was 281 million 191 million and 1370 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we disposed of businesses in various markets resulting in a gain of 210 million including transaction costs in connection with the dispositions we closed a landfill resulting in an asset impairment charge of 287 million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping closure and postclosure obligations additionally we recorded asset impairments of 204 million primarily related to certain longlived assets that are held for sale and for losses on the divestiture of certain businesses and related goodwill proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were 142 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

we divested certain assets throughout 2010 resulting in a net loss on disposition of assets of 40 million including transaction costs additionally we recorded an impairment loss of 151 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we divested of certain assets as required by the doj as a condition of the allied acquisition and recorded a gain of 1535 million offsetting this gain was a loss of 102 million recognized in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in miamidade county florida as well as 71 million of additional asset impairments primarily related to our former corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale 

restructuring charges 

during 2010 and 2009 we incurred 114 million and 632 million respectively of restructuring and integration charges related to the integration of allied which consisted of charges and adjustments for severance employee termination and relocation benefits the remainder of the charges primarily related to consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment we completed our restructuring plan in 2010 and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges related to the allied acquisition in 2011 

interest expense 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and selffunded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition in millions 

 

 the decrease in interest expense is due to refinancing our higher interest rate debt and the net reduction of borrowings accretion of debt discounts continues to decrease as the discounts are writtenoff upon refinancing the associated debt 

  

the debt we assumed from allied was recorded at fair value as of december 5 2008 we recorded a discount of 6243 million which is amortized as interest expense over the applicable terms of the related debt instruments or written off upon refinancing the remaining unamortized discounts on the outstanding debt assumed from allied as of december 31 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 loss on extinguishment of debt 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs the following table summarizes the loss on extinguishment of debt by securities for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

   

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 3174 million 3695 million and 3685 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective income tax rate was 350 421 and 426 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by our december 2011 settlement with the irs related to allied’s 2000 – 2003 tax years which contributed to a net favorable impact to our tax provision of approximately 23 million additionally our 2011 tax provision was favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately 19 million in 2010 and 2009 our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by the disposition of assets that had little or no basis for tax and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 

our effective income tax rate can be adversely impacted by expenses incurred that are nondeductible for tax purposes disposition of assets that have little or no basis for tax and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions in the future we may choose to divest of certain operating assets that have little or no tax basis thereby resulting in a higher taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized the higher taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in which the divestiture is consummated 

we made income tax payments net of refunds received of 173 million 418 million and 444 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively income taxes paid in 2011 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 tax relief act that was signed into law in december 2010 bonus depreciation the tax relief act included 100 bonus depreciation for property placed in service after september 8 2010 and through december 31 2011 and for certain longterm construction projects to be placed in service in 2012 and 50 bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2012 and for certain longterm construction projects to be placed in service in 2013 we anticipate our cash paid for income taxes for 2012 will be approximately 140 million higher than that of 2011

reportable segments 

our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments summary financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources closed landfills and other typical administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing 2011 to 2010 and 2010 to 2009 are discussed in the following paragraphs the results of our reportable segments were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and liabilities as required by the doj in connection with the allied acquisition and in the normal course of business 

2011 compared to 2010 

eastern region 

revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except residential collection and an increase in commodity recycling revenue volume increases in our residential collection and landfill lines of business also helped to increase our revenue 

  

operating margins were 234 in 2011 versus 235 in 2010 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to higher fuel commodities and sales and marketing costs these unfavorable items were partially offset by the favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 119 million in 2011 compared to a favorable adjustment of 33 million in 2010 operating margins for 2011 also were impacted by lower disposal subcontract and transportation costs as a result of a decline in subcontracted volumes and a lower loss on the disposition of assets and impairments 

midwestern region 

revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business and an increase in recycling commodity revenue these increases were offset by volume declines in our residential collection transfer station and disposal lines of business in part due to the expiration of the city of toronto transportation and disposal contract 

operating margins were 208 in 2011 versus 228 in 2010 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of 93 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 02 million in 2011 operating margins were also impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold as well as sales and marketing costs and legal settlements these decreases were partially offset by lower disposal subcontract and transportation costs primarily due to the expiration of the city of toronto contract 

southern region 

revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except residential collection and transfer station an increase in landfill volume and an increase in recycling commodity revenue these increases were partially offset by volume declines in our commercial and residential collection lines of business 

operating margins were 227 in 2011 versus 244 in 2010 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the early closure of a landfill resulting in an impairment charge of 287 million the impairment was partially offset by a gain of 172 million relating to the disposition of businesses in three markets during the second quarter of 2011 operating margins were also impacted by unfavorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 24 million in 2011 compared to a favorable adjustment of 38 million in 2010 additionally operating margins were impacted by higher fuel commodities and sales and marketing costs partially offset by lower disposal costs during 2011 versus 2010 

western region 

revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business and an increase in recycling commodity revenues the increases were partially offset by volume declines in all lines of business primarily due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract 

operating margins were 226 in 2011 versus 238 in 2010 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the losses on dispositions of assets and impairments during 2011 of 52 million from the divestiture of a business versus 09 million for 2010 and higher fuel costs in 2011 additionally in 2010 there was a favorable 60 million adjustment to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations these decreases were partially offset by lower labor benefit and disposal costs due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract 

corporate entities 

operating loss improved 919 million in 2011 versus 2010 during 2010 we incurred 333 million of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan and 114 million of restructuring and integration charges related to our acquisition of allied operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher litigation and management incentive plan costs additionally during 2011 we recorded a gain on the disposition of assets and impairments of 11 million versus an impairment loss of 144 million related to certain long lived assets that were held and used for 2010 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

eastern region 

revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business while our landfill line of business reflected a modest increase 2010 includes revenue of 208 million associated with divested locations 2009 includes revenue of 619 million associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue increased 16 million for 2010 versus 2009 

operating margins were 235 in 2010 versus 228 in 2009 the increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor benefits disposal transportation repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by lower risk insurance costs these increases were partially offset by the loss on the disposition of assets of 150 million in 2010 compared to the gain of 40 million in 2009 and by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold in 2010 we also recorded a 120 million recovery of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility that reduced our landfill operating costs during the third quarter of 2009 

midwestern region 

revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except landfill while price associated with municipal solid waste volumes increased during 2010 this increase was offset by a higher mix of special waste volumes however the increase in revenue from core price for 2010 was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business landfill volumes increased for 2010 primarily due to special waste event driven work 2010 includes revenues of 225 million associated with divested locations 2009 includes revenue of 315 million associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue decreased 11 million for 2010 versus 2009 

operating margins were 228 in 2010 versus 207 in 2009 the increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor benefits disposal transportation and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 106 million in 2010 compared to a favorable adjustment of 14 million in 2009 these increases were partially offset by the lower gain on the disposition of assets of 93 million in 2010 compared to a gain of 271 million in 2009 and higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold in 2010 

southern region 

revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except transfer station however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines especially in our collection and landfill lines of business contributing to the decline in revenue for 2009 was 304 million of revenue associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue decreased 385 million for 2010 versus 2009 

operating margins were 244 in 2010 versus 256 in 2009 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of 18 million in the 2010 period compared to the gain of 298 million in 2009 operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold these decreases were partially offset by lower labor benefits disposal and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures and lower risk insurance costs 

western region 

revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines especially in our collection and transfer station lines of 

  

business landfill volumes in 2010 increased primarily due to special waste event driven work 2009 includes revenues of 110 million associated with divested locations excluding the divested revenue revenue increased 296 million for 2010 versus 2009 

operating margins were 238 in 2010 versus 268 in 2009 the decrease in operating margins is primarily attributed to the loss on disposition of assets of 09 million in 2010 compared to the gain of 881 million in 2009 operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold these decreases were partially offset by lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 60 million in 2010 compared to an unfavorable adjustment of 64 million in 2009 we also recorded a 52 million remediation charge in 2009 related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california 

corporate entities 

the changes in net revenue relates to our national accounts program included in our gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net for 2010 and 2009 are transaction related expenses from the disposition of assets in our other segments additionally during 2010 we recorded an impairment loss of 144 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used 

landfill and environmental matters 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with applying daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

  

available airspace 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

   

changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

as of december 31 2011 we owned or operated 191 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 48 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2011 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 46 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 02 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

as of december 31 2011 eight of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 53 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 61 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2011 

 

 final capping closure and postclosure costs 

as of december 31 2011 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10370 million of which 852 million is current and 9518 million is longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

in december 2009 we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied or a predecessor company that it had acquired had been identified as a potentially responsible party the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring see also note 2 summary of significant accounting policies – environmental remediation liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information we have 

  

recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 975 discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

countywide landfill in september 2009 republic services of ohio ii llc entered into final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december 31 2011 is 568 million of which 50 million is expected to be paid during 2012 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 53 million to 74 million 

congress landfill in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2011 is 836 million of which 74 million is expected to be paid during 2012 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 53 million to 154 million

 the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 during 2011 our average compaction rate was approximately 1900 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average as compared to 1800 pounds per cubic yard for 2010 our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

as of december 31 2011 we expect to spend an estimated additional 65 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 98 billion or 204 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method

the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity at december 31 2011 our ebitda to interest ratio was 525 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 299 compared to the 350 maximum allowed by the covenants at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2012 

ebitda which is a nongaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

  

senior notes and debentures 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the noncash writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs for a more detailed discussion see our “ loss on extinguishment of debt ” section of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in august 2011 our 6750 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 3870 million of principal due on these notes 

in may 2011 we issued 7000 million of 3800 senior notes due 2018 the 3800 notes 5500 million of 4750 senior notes due 2023 the 4750 notes and 6000 million of 5700 senior notes due 2041 the 5700 notes and together with the 3800 notes and the 4750 notes the 2011 notes the 2011 notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors we used the net proceeds from the 2011 notes as follows i 6214 million to fund the redemption of our 6000 million 7125 senior notes maturing in 2016 ii 816 million to purchase 592 million of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 9250 debentures maturing in 2021 iii 2218 million to purchase 1807 million of our subsidiary browningferris industries llc’s 7400 debentures maturing in 2035 iv 6190 million to repay borrowings under our credit facilities and v the remainder for general corporate purposes in may 2011 our 6375 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2169 million of principal due on these notes 

in february 2011 our 5750 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2629 million of principal due on these notes 

in november 2010 our 650 senior notes matured we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to repay 2216 million of principal due on these notes 

in march 2010 we issued 8500 million of 500 senior notes due 2020 the 2020 notes with an unamortized discount of 01 million at december 31 2010 and 6500 million of 620 senior notes due 2040 the 2040 notes and together with the 2020 notes the 2010 notes the 2010 notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors we used the net proceeds from the 2010 notes as follows i 4337 million to redeem the 6125 senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102042 4250 million principal outstanding ii 6218 million to redeem the 7250 senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103625 6000 million principal outstanding and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes during the first quarter of 2010 we incurred a loss of 1321 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt to write off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes 

taxexempt financings 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 11264 million and 11518 million respectively of fixed and variable rate taxexempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2035 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the total of the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the taxexempt financings assumed from allied was 158 million and 219 million respectively which is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt 

approximately 75 of our taxexempt financings are remarketed quarterly weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield certain of these variable rate taxexempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period to date the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured taxexempt bonds these bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities if necessary 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had 1896 million of restricted cash and marketable securities of which 225 million represented proceeds from the issuance of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 

fuel hedges 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges for a detailed listing of our outstanding fuel hedges during 2011 and 2010 see note 15 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges at december 31 2011 and 2010 were current assets of 16 million and current liabilities of 47 million and 19 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2011 and 2010 net of tax of 18 million and 02 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2011 approximately 4 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we were able to recover approximately 68 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 

recycling commodity hedges 

revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ and onp sales the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales recycling commodity hedges for a detailed listing of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges during 2011 and 2010 see note 15 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

the aggregated fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges at december 31 2011 and 2010 were current assets of 14 million and 19 million respectively and current liabilities of 07 million and 65 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values of our recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 2011 and 2010 net of tax of 04 million and 26 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

approximately 33 of our 2011 sales volume of commodities was subject to cash flow hedges 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 in millions 

 

 we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2011 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

debt covenants 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2011 we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2012 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under 

  

our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

financial assurance 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit or insurance policies the financial assurance instruments or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2011 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is as follows in millions 

 

 the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

contingencies 

for a description of our contingencies see note 10 income taxes and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

landfill accounting 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 

   

 landfill development costs 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

site permits in order to develop construct and operate a landfill we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

residual risks 

 

  

  

 technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 

  

  

   

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

residual risks 

 

  

  

 development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

residual risk 

 

 landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 

   

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed we must to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 25 in both 2011 and 2010 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 60 in 2011 and 55 in 2010 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis 

  

as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

residual risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

permitted and probable disposal capacity disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

residual risk 

 

 environmental liabilities 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied that were recorded at estimated fair value environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

residual risks 

 

   

  

 selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured accruals for selfinsurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 20 million to 50 million 

residual risks 

 

  

  

 loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

residual risks 

 

  

 asset impairment 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

  

residual risk 

 

 evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

residual risk 

 

 recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

goodwill recoverability 

we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists we test goodwill for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern midwestern southern and western in determining fair value we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 2 to 4 ii future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40 iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital iv estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 7 and 8 and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our four reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

  

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2011 we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings andor synergies by obtaining control and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 

as of december 31 2011 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of 30 to approximately 60 and therefore we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

we will continuously monitor market trends in our business the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill additionally we would then be required to review our remaining longlived assets for impairment 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

residual risks 

 

  

 income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid we are subject to us federal income taxes and numerous state jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 

regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon 

  

examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

residual risks 

 

  

  

  

  

 defined benefit pension plans 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee at december 31 2011 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash we annually review and adjust the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was 399 million as of december 31 2011 compared to 77 million as of december 31 2010 

residual risk 

 

   

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 31 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 37 million 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” 

 

   

the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 1704 million 

fuel price risk 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new or renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

at our current consumption levels a onecent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 14 million on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 

commodities prices 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our materials recovery facilities market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices at current volumes and mix of materials we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change revenue and operating income by approximately 27 million and 18 million respectively on an annual basis revenue from sales of these products in 2011 2010 and 2009 was approximately 4386 million 3379 million and 2298 million respectively

 item 1 business 

 

overview 

 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 348 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we own or operate 204 transfer stations 193 active solid waste landfills and 76 recycling facilities we also operate 73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 54 billion of which approximately 60 is generated by publicly owned waste companies we believe that we and one other public waste company generated in excess of 60 of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue additionally industry data indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 17 and 23 respectively of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business therefore the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we can drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer we implement this strategy through an organizational structure that groups our operations within a corporate region and area structure we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments which are also our reportable segments eastern midwestern southern and western the boundaries of our operating segments may change from time to time each of our regions is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe this structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy it also allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

 

on december 5 2008 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of allied waste industries inc allied in a stockforstock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 121 billion which included 54 billion of debt at fair value the acquisition created a company with a strong national operating platform the foundation of this platform is our large network of disposal sites which provides us with a far stronger vertically integrated operating structure than either company would have been able to achieve on its own we believe that our improved vertically integrated operations will be a key driver of our future profitability 

 

we had revenue of 81 billion 82 billion and 37 billion and operating income of 15 billion 16 billion and 03 billion for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition to the allied acquisition a number of items impacted our 2010 2009 and 2008 financial results for a description of these items see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview and consolidated results of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the past several years we supported our internal growth strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average population growth we believe our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than those of declining population growth 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our operating and financial strategies to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics including increasing free cash flow achieving targeted earnings maintaining and improving returns on invested capital and maintaining the integration synergies we have achieved our operating and financial strategies are described further herein 

 

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following 

 

  

experienced executive management team 

 

we believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry 

 

donald w slager became our ceo and remained our president on january 1 2011 after having served as our president and chief operating officer coo from the allied acquisition in december 2008 until then prior to the acquisition mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations mr slager held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 30 years of experience in the solid waste industry mr slager has been a member of our board of directors since june 24 2010 

 

tod c holmes has served as our chief financial officer since august 1998 mr holmes served as our vice president of finance from june 1998 until august 1998 and as vice president of finance of our former parent company’s solid waste group from january 1998 until june 1998 from 1987 to 1998 mr holmes served in various management positions with browningferris industries inc including vice president investor relations from 1996 to 1998 divisional vice president collection operations from 1995 to 1996 divisional vice president and regional controller – northern region from 1993 to 1995 and divisional vice president and assistant corporate controller from 1991 to 1993 mr holmes has over 23 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

kevin walbridge has served as our executive vice president – operations since october 1 2010 mr walbridge served as our senior vice president of midwestern operations from december 2008 until then and served as our central region vice president from the time he joined us in 1997 through december 2008 before joining us mr walbridge served as the vice president operationscoowner of national serv all from 1996 to 1997 the president of waste management of alameda county from 1993 to 1996 and the division president of empire waste management from 1985 to 1993 mr walbridge has over 28 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

michael p rissman has served as our executive vice president general counsel and corporate secretary since august 2009 previously mr rissman had served as acting general counsel and corporate secretary 

from march 2009 mr rissman joined allied as vice president and deputy general counsel in july 2007 and continued in the same positions at republic following the allied acquisition in december 2008 prior to joining allied mr rissman was a partner at mayer brown rowe  maw llp in chicago where he worked from 1990 until coming to allied in 2007 

 

our regional senior vice presidents have an average of 25 years of experience in the industry 

 

decentralized management structure 

 

we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to more efficiently manage our daytoday operations our local management has extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets allowing us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities each regional management team includes a senior vice president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization our regional management teams and area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets compensation for area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager’s geographic area of responsibility in addition through longterm incentive programs including stock options we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to continue improving operating margins 

 

strong integrated operating platform 

 

we believe that with the allied acquisition we have created a company with a strong national operating platform most previous attempts to consolidate the waste industry focused on a “roll up” strategy often involving relatively young companies solely focused on increasing revenue through acquisitions we believe that the combination of republic’s and allied’s mature and proven business practices has been a critical component of our success and has driven the realization of approximately 190 million in annual runrate synergies since completion of the acquisition during 2011 we will continue to monitor the synergies we believe we have achieved and we will implement additional initiatives aimed at further improving operating margins 

 

separate from acquisition related integration activities we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies transfer stations and landfills we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volumes 

 

we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 67 68 and 58 respectively of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization this increase in internalization from 2008 to 2009 is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in the allied acquisition in a number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities flowcontrol this provides us with an opportunity to effectively 

compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity by further integrating operations in existing markets we may be able to reduce our disposal costs 

 

we continue to invest in integrating and expanding our information systems and technology platform our platform consists of the best of the legacy systems from both republic and allied during 2009 we converted the entire company to a single payable and general ledger system during 2010 we converted to a single operating system and we transitioned the entire company to a single payroll and human resource system our future technology related initiatives will include customer relationship management billing productivity and maintenance systems we believe that the combination of these systems will prove to be a competitive advantage for our company 

 

major initiatives 

 

during 2010 we believe we completed the most successful integration and consolidation of two major companies in the waste industry the integration process allowed us to select the best tools and systems and to adopt the best practices of these two successful companies during 2011 we will continue or begin to implement the following major initiatives aimed at improving profitability 

 

  

we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of vehicles equipment landfills and other facilities to ensure the highest level of service to our customers and the communities we serve in addition we continue to focus on innovative waste disposal processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices we believe that these in turn will help us achieve profitable growth 

 

during 2011 we will continue to exceed our customers’ expectations through the consistent delivery of high quality service and an expanded use of technology to make it easier to do business with us our technology eventually will allow more customers to access information and perform functions like change service requests and make payments over the internet that were previously done with the assistance of a customer service representative by increasing the ease of use and functionality of our webbased market presence we believe we will enhance customer satisfaction and retention while we lower our costs 

 

 5 

 

in addition our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate volume discounts for goods and services purchased further we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets for example to reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operating density additionally in 2011 we will continue to convert certain of our residential routes to single driver sideload service thereby increasing employee safety and increasing route efficiency and service times we continue to invest in our material recovery facilities by converting certain facilities from dual to single stream sorting and by updating our technology and equipment all resulting in higher levels of productivity and recovered materials from a more efficient collection and recovery process by using assets more efficiently operating expenses can be reduced 

 

  

price growth we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 

 

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing populations these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets we believe it is important to have secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in growing market areas we believe that this positions us to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate in addition we believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growing population markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions volume growth includes not only expanding landfill and transfer station capacity and investing in trucks and containers but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

 

sales and marketing activities we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate we provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of our national clients centralizing services to effectively manage their needs such as minimizing their procurement costs we currently have approximately 1100 sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue generally these employees directly solicit business from existing and new business from prospective commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in training sales personnel we emphasize increased price and cost structures as well as the use of a customer relationship management system that assists in tracking sales opportunities it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts we believe our national accounts program offers an opportunity for sales growth over the next several years 

 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations recycling facilities and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development 

projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

 

acquisition growth our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held solid waste and recycling companies and the waste and recycling operations of municipal and other local governmental authorities that complement our existing business platform we believe our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements due to changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for privately held companies we also seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing as they seek to raise capital and reduce risk in addition we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following 

 

  

in addition we have and may continue to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase revenue and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

  

for certain risks related to our operating strategy see item 1a risk factors 

 

financial strategy 

 

key components of our financial strategy include generating and growing free cash flow and sustaining or improving our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of stockholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operations free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and reducing debt paying cash dividends repurchasing our stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization free cash flow is also a key metric used to determine management’s compensation 

 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder value as well as our return on invested capital our financial strategy includes 

 

market growth and optimization 

 

within our markets our goal is to deliver sustainable longterm profitable growth while efficiently operating our assets to generate acceptable rates of return we allocate capital to businesses markets and development projects to support growth in order to achieve acceptable rates of return we develop previously nonpermitted noncontiguous landfill sites greenfield landfill sites we also expand our existing landfill sites when possible we supplement this organic growth with acquisitions of operating assets such as landfills transfer stations material recovery facilities and tuckin acquisitions of collection and disposal operations in existing markets we continuously evaluate our existing operating assets and their deployment within each market to determine if we have optimized our position and to ensure appropriate investment of capital where operations are not generating acceptable returns we examine opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies and returns through the integration of additional assets if such enhancements are not possible we may ultimately decide to divest the existing assets and reallocate resources to other markets

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 348 collection companies in 2010 762 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 35 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 40 is from services provided to commercial customers and 25 is from services provided to industrial and other customers 

 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors collection frequency type of equipment furnished the type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 

 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

we also provide recycling services in certain markets these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

transfer and disposal services we own or operate 204 transfer stations we deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities in 2010 transfer and disposal services accounted for 182 of our revenue 

 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or operated 193 active landfills which had approximately 36000 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 47 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

we also have responsibility for 129 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

landfill gas and renewable energy projects during 2010 we brought two new landfill gas to energy lfgte projects on line resulting in a total of 73 active lfgte projects these projects consist of the following 

 

  

the beneficial use of landfill gas provides our economy and environment with significant benefits including 

 

  

our 51 generating projects produce 321 megawatts of electricity annually which is enough power to supply the electric needs of 189530 homes our 22 other lfgte projects process and produce 55950 cubic feet per minute of landfill gas annually which provides an energy benefit equivalent to heating 190151 homes the environmental benefit of all of our projects removes the equivalent of 950434 tons of methane emissions and 2346535 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere this is equivalent to removing the emissions of approximately 39 million cars from our highways 

 

one of the two new projects a medium btu use project at our newton county landfill received the usepa 2010 project of the year award 

 

in 2010 we also began the design and construction of new projects at nine landfills which is comprised of seven electric plants one medium btu plant and one high btu plant the high btu project announced in the fall of 2010 will feature an industry first process of producing high btu pipeline quality gas and using that gas to provide equivalent renewable compressed natural gas cng to a portion of our expanding fleet of cng refuse vehicles 

 

recycling facilities and other services we own or operate 76 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction our business is derived from a broad customer base which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 1100 sales and marketing employees with a sales and marketing strategy of providing highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

 

while most of our marketing activity is local in nature we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of national and regional customers this national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams 

balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize procurement costs with our extended geographic reach this program effectively serves our customers nationwide as industry leaders our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 

 

historically we have not always changed the trade names of the local businesses we acquired and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name the majority of our operations however are branded under either “republic” “allied” or “bfi” 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to a broad base of commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no single customer has individually accounted for more than 3 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry however entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few other large national publicly owned companies including waste management inc several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies and thousands of small privately owned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations including 

criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves refer to the contractual obligations table within item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contained elsewhere herein for further information 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 

  

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the implementation of federal environmental requirements by state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits and reduced revenue from lost operational time 

 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

  

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves in addition the 

epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing remediation wastes at appropriatelylicensed facilities given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have 

adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal in the event of leaks or releases from these tanks these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various state and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdiction lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste is unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore is unconstitutional in 2007 the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned and publicly operated waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may in some cases cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations 

 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers’ liability workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts closure and postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 30000 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements from time to time our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business our management believes that we have good relations with our employees

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 70 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing dividends or stock repurchases selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

 

the downturn in the us economy may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results 

 

a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated in 2010 weakness in the us economy had a negative effect on our revenue operating results and operating cash flows the current and previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries as a result of the global economic crisis we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows furthermore recovery in solid waste volumes historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy and we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts and others 

 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counterparty risk associated with our derivatives 

 

to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates we have entered into a number of derivative agreements these derivative agreements require us or the counterparty to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary from a specified amount although we only enter these agreements with investment graderated financial institutions a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counterparties with which we do business potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on disposal costs geographic location and quality of operations one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do further many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors as a result of these factors from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues it could negatively impact our revenues and profitability 

 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs including fuel and environmental costs to maintain or improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors may reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices for example many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one our costs may increase in excess of the increase if any in the consumer price index this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases we may also lose volume to lowercost competitors 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 

 

we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal fuel prices are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries and regional production patterns due to contractual or market factors we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges for example our fuel costs were 4076 million in 2010 representing 50 of our revenue compared to 3498 million in 2009 representing 43 of our revenue 

 

to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount during 2010 approximately 7 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers for 2010 we were able to recover approximately 66 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees 

 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles in november 2010 epa finalized its renewable fuel standard for 2011 which mandates increasing volumes of renewable fuels and biofuels to be used in motor vehicles driven in the us these regulations will likely affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses and in the nearterm increase the cost of that fuel our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have in the past and may in the future enter into swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties if the price of commodities varies from a specified amount or range 

 

adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change any of which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

 

we currently have matters pending with the internal revenue service the “irs” which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 

 

during its examination of allied’s 2002 tax year the irs asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in wastetoenergy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs the company believes its position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on 

this matter the potential tax and interest through december 31 2010 to the extent unpaid have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet a disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations however a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made the accrual of additional interest charges through the time this matter is resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations in addition the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

additionally during its examination of allied’s 2000 through 2007 tax years the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills the irs’ position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and therefore associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed we believe we have several meritorious defenses including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services therefore we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

for additional information on these matters see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends repurchase stock reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends or we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 

 

a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 

 

while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term if the rating agencies downgrade our debt this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt if our debt ratings are downgraded future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost or at all also may be adversely impacted 

 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we expend on capital capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may 

occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions in may 2010 the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” finalized the first us standards for ghg emissions from conventional automobiles including large pickup trucks these regulations include increased fuel economy requirements and apply to new motor vehicles covering model years 2012 through 2016 we do not expect that this final rule will lead to a material increase in our capital costs later in 2010 the epa and the nhtsa proposed rules expanding the scope of ghg emission standards for motor vehicles to include heavy duty vehicles including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers these rules would similarly include increased fuel economy standards for such vehicles and would apply to new heavyduty motor vehicles covering model years 2014 through 2018 because the rule is still in the proposal stage we cannot predict its effect on us but it could increase our capital costs this also could cause an increase in vehicle operating costs or a reduction in operating efficiency 

 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate nonhazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our nonhazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such accruals and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income additionally if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 

 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting and recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills although such actions are useful in protecting our environment these actions as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 

 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 

 

we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise in future periods we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

 

complying with laws and regulations governing the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and may in the future continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to be debated on the federal regional and state level our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg and our vehicle fleets emit among others carbon dioxide which has also been identified as a ghg conventional wisdom now suggests that passage of comprehensive federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely nonetheless should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority in october 2009 epa published a proposed prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule psd tailoring rule epa finalized the psd tailoring rule on may 13 2010 the finalized psd tailoring rule establishes new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits would be required and would “tailor” these programs to limit which facilities would be required to obtain permits epa’s legal authority to “tailor” this rule has been challenged as of january 2 2011 some of our landfills became subject to the psd tailoring rule which requires permit amendments and could require additional emission controls for ghgs when modifications are made to these landfills which could increase our costs 

 

on october 25 2010 epa and the department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa proposed rules to reduce ghg emissions from medium and heavy duty vehicles these proposed rules if finalized would impose higher fuel economy standards of heavy duty vehicles as such the proposed rules could require us to expend additional capital on our vehicle fleet 

 

in addition to the obligations imposed by the psd tailoring rule as a result of epa finding that six ghgs endanger public health in december 2009 epa may impose additional ghg emissions controls on stationary sources while epa made its finding in the context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles now that it has made the endangerment finding other provisions of the clean air act provide epa with the authority to impose further regulations upon stationary sources of ghg emissions including landfills we cannot predict the requirements or effective date of any additional stationary source rules that might apply to landfills as a result of the endangerment finding and accordingly we cannot assure you that further developments in this area will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie 

generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar state laws or rcra in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are and from time to time become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates as such we cannot assure you that 

 

  

if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any 

indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management actual results could differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation employee benefit and pension plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance 

 

we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 

 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 27 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes work stoppages or other slowdowns we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and if successful the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 

 

we contribute to at least 28 multiemployer pension plans covering at least 22 of our current employees we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period furthermore under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a “withdrawal event” we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be 

required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors 

 

overview 

 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 348 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we own or operate 204 transfer stations 193 active solid waste landfills and 76 recycling facilities we also operate 73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we completed our acquisition of allied waste industries inc allied in december 2008 we believe that this acquisition creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 

 

despite the challenging economic environment our business has performed well during 2010 due in large part to the indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our business revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased by 11 or 925 million to 81066 million as compared to 81991 million during the comparable period in 2009 due to the allied acquisition the doj required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities the resulting divestitures as well as other divestitures in the normal course of business decreased revenue by 11 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the year ended december 31 2009 excluding divested revenue core revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 was unchanged consisting of a 16 increase in core price 14 increase in commodity price and a 05 increase in fuel charges offset by a decrease of 35 in core volume due to the continued weak economy the core price increase together with operating efficiencies arising from the acquisition and cost control measures taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes served to moderate profit margin declines 

 

during 2010 we completed the integration of allied operations resulting in approximately 190 million of annual runrate synergy savings of which 161 million relates to operating synergies and 29 million relates to financing synergies exceeding our original estimate of approximately 150 million by 267 since the acquisition in 2008 we have repaid 13 billion of net borrowings through december 31 2010 and have refinanced 15 billion of senior notes and 6774 million of taxexempt financings at lower interest rates free cash flow generated from operations allowed us to increase our regular quarterly dividend 5 in the third quarter of 2010 and in november 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 4000 million of our outstanding shares of common stock 

2011 guidance 

 

our objectives for 2011 remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and through the efficient use of free cash flow despite the challenging economy we remain committed to continuing our broadbased pricing program across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins 

 

our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in 2011 specific guidance follows 

 

revenue 

 

we expect 2011 revenue to increase by approximately 05 to 15 this consists of the following 

 

 

 

approximately 50 of our annual revenue is restricted as to the amount of certain pricing changes such restrictions on price increases include but are not limited to each of the following 

 

  

of these restricted pricing arrangements approximately 70 are based on a consumer price index 20 are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time in addition many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect as a result current changes in a specific index such as the consumer price index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future 

 

property and equipment 

 

in 2011 we anticipate receiving 750 million of property and equipment purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2011 are expected to be 870 million and represent amounts paid during 2011 for such expenditures the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is adjustments for approximately 120 million of property and equipment received during 2010 but paid for in 2011 

 

recent developments 

 

subsequent to december 31 2010 we i entered into certain interest rate locks with an aggregate notional amount in excess of 5500 million to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of a planned issuance of senior notes in the first half of 2011 and ii financed the maturity of our 2629 million 5750 senior notes with proceeds from our credit facilities 

business acquisitions and divestitures 

 

we make decisions to acquire invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

 

acquisition of allied waste industries inc 

 

on december 5 2008 we acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of allied in a stockforstock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 121 billion which included 54 billion of debt at fair value we completed the integration of the operations of the two companies and converted to one operating system during 2010 

 

as a condition of the allied acquisition the doj required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities we completed all of the required divestitures during 2009 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

the following table summarizes our operating revenue costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008

during each of the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we recorded a number of gains charges recoveries and other expenses that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic 

services inc net income – republic and diluted earnings per share these items primarily consist of the following in millions except per share data 

 

 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt during 2010 we refinanced 6774 million and repaid 978 million of our taxexempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 285 million related to the writeoff of unamortized debt discounts and professional fees to effectuate these transactions 

 

additionally during 2010 we issued 8500 million of 500 senior notes due 2020 and 6500 million of 620 senior notes due 2040 collectively the notes we used the net proceeds from the notes as follows i 4337 million to redeem the 6125 senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102042 4250 million principal outstanding ii 6218 million to redeem the 7250 senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103625 6000 million principal outstanding and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1321 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt to writeoff unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes separately we incurred a loss of 02 million in 2010 related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred issuance costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program 

 

during 2009 we issued 12500 million of senior notes the proceeds of which were primarily used to purchase and retire outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 through 2034 additionally we repurchased certain of our outstanding senior notes in the secondary market 

 

costs to achieve synergies during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred 333 million of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan that are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses versus 418 million and 29 million for the comparable 2009 and 2008 periods respectively these incremental costs primarily relate to a synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs in 2011 we do not expect to incur any additional costs to achieve synergies 

 

restructuring charges during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred 114 million of restructuring and integration charges related to the allied acquisition versus 632 million and 827 million for the comparable 2009 and 2008 periods respectively these charges consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment in 2011 we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring charges related to the allied acquisition 

 

remediation recoveries charges during 2009 we recovered 120 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility which were partially offset by additional charges of 52 million at our closed disposal facility in california remediation and related charges of 1568 million during 2008 were attributable to changes to our cost estimates at the countywide facility our closed disposal facility in california and the sunrise landfill in nevada 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded a net loss on the disposition of assets of 40 million as a result of business divestures including transaction costs additionally during 2010 we recorded an impairment loss of 151 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used

in addition to the items discussed above we incurred the following charges during the year ended december 31 2008 

 

  

we believe that the presentation of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

these gains and charges affected our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 as follows in millions 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including transfer stations landfill disposal and recycling our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our 

residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer station landfill and to a lesser extent our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials other revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of recyclable materials and revenue from national accounts national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the respective years ended december 31 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

the following table reflects changes in our core adjusted revenue for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we have presented the components of our revenue changes for the year ended december 31 2009 assuming the allied acquisition occurred on january 1 2008 

 

 

 

intercompany revenue relates to prior year transactions between republic and allied that would have been eliminated if the companies had merged on january 1 2008 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation 

revenue – 2010 versus 2009 

 

the decrease in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the following 

 

  

revenue – 2009 versus 2008 

 

the increase in revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 is due to the allied acquisition in december 2008 additionally 

 

  

cost of operations 

 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel credits disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes landfill accretion financial assurance leachate 

disposal and other landfill maintenance costs risk management which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

 

during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 67 68 and 58 respectively of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization this increase in internalization from 2008 to 2009 is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in the allied acquisition 

 

cost of operations – 2010 versus 2009 

 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased 03 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of the following 

 

  

partially offset by 

 

 41 

 

cost of operations – 2009 versus 2008 

 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue improved 65 to 591 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 656 for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the following 

 

  

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment – 2010 versus 2009 

 

the decrease in landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue is due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes and assets divested as required by the doj depreciation and amortization of property and equipment as a percentage of revenue has remained consistent year over year 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment – 2009 versus 2008 

 

the increase in depreciation amortization and depletion expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in depreciation and depletion expense associated with equipment and landfills acquired from allied and recorded at their fair values we allocated 26 billion of fair value to the landfills we acquired from allied the increase in the landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars is directly attributable to this allocation of fair value 

 

amortization of other intangible and other assets 

 

expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were 715 million 706 million and 118 million or as a percentage of revenue 09 09 and 03 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists franchise agreements municipal contracts trade names favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements the 

increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 versus 2008 is due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of the allied acquisition 

 

accretion expense 

 

accretion expense was 805 million 888 million and 239 million or as a percentage of revenue 10 11 and 07 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in accretion expense in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate used to accrete new layers of our capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the divestiture of several landfills the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2009 versus 2008 is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with the allied acquisition the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of 975 which is higher than the creditadjusted riskfree rate we have used historically to record such obligations 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties marketing investor and community relations directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges 

 

the following table provides the components of our selling general and administrative costs for the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies 

 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2010 versus 2009 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 224 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009 and as a percentage of revenue remained consistent with 2009 selling general and administrative expenses includes an accrual for synergy bonus related to the allied acquisition of approximately 33 million in 2010 and 34 million in 2009 in 2011 we do not expect to incur any additional costs to achieve synergies 

 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2009 versus 2008 

 

selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 include 416 million of costs to achieve synergies related to the allied acquisition these costs primarily consist of a synergy related bonus of approximately 34 million accrued in 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 142 million of bad debt expense related to conforming allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and 54 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures we also recorded 243 million of settlement 

charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters and a charge of 29 million related to the synergy related bonus 

 

excluding charges for synergies conforming accounting policies bankruptcies and certain legal matters selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 would have been 8247 million 8388 million and 3879 million or 102 102 and 105 as a percentage of revenue respectively with the completion of the integration of allied our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative costs at no more than 100 of revenue which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 

 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net 

 

loss gain on disposition of assets and impairments net of costs to sell was 191 million 1370 million and 898 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we divested certain assets throughout 2010 resulting in a net loss on disposition of assets of 40 million including transaction costs additionally we recorded an impairment loss of 151 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used 

 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we divested of certain assets as required by the doj as a condition of the allied acquisition and recorded a gain of 1535 million offsetting this gain was a loss of 102 million recognized in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in miamidade county florida as well as 71 million of additional asset impairments primarily related to our former corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a charge of 759 million related to the impairment of the countywide facility this impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa based upon recent negotiations with the oepa and the epa also during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 78 million of other impairment charges consisting primarily of charges related to our former corporate office in south florida 

 

restructuring charges 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred 114 million of restructuring and integration charges related to the integration of allied which consisted of charges and adjustments for severance employee termination and relocation benefits the remainder of the charges primarily related to consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate entities segment we do not expect to incur any significant additional charges with respect to this plan during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we incurred 632 million and 827 million respectively of such charges 

 

interest expense 

 

the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and selffunded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010 versus 2009 is due to refinancing our higher interest rate debt during 2010 and in the second half of 2009 and the net reduction of borrowings 

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 versus 2008 is primarily due to the additional debt we assumed as a result of the allied acquisition interest expense also increased as a result of accreting discounts applied to debt or imputing interest on environmental and risk reserves assumed from allied 

 

the debt we assumed from allied was recorded at fair value as of december 5 2008 we recorded a discount of 6243 million which is amortized as interest expense over the applicable terms of the related debt instruments or writtenoff upon refinancing the remaining unamortized discounts on the outstanding debt assumed from allied as of december 31 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt was 1608 million for the year ended december 31 2010 resulting from the following 

 

  

loss on early extinguishment of debt was 1341 million for the year ended december 31 2009 resulting from the following 

 

 45 

 

  

in the future we may chose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 

 

income taxes 

 

our provision for income taxes was 3695 million 3685 million and 854 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective income tax rate was 421 426 and 536 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses incurred which are nondeductible for tax disposition of assets that have little or no basis for tax and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 

 

in the future we may choose to divest certain operating assets that have little or no tax basis thereby resulting in a higher taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized the higher taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in which the divestiture is consummated 

 

reportable segments 

 

our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources corporate accounts and other typical administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

 

we completed the reorganization of our operating segments related to the allied acquisition in the first quarter of 2009 and are providing internal and external reporting in accordance with our reorganized structure significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing 2010 to 2009 and 2009 to 2008 are discussed in the following paragraphs the results of our reportable segments were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and liabilities as required by the doj as well as in the normal course of business additionally for 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease in revenue resulting from declines in volumes noted below is attributable to the continued economic slowdown the increase in aggregate dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 for revenue depreciation amortization depletion and accretion and operating income loss for each of our reportable segments is due to the allied acquisition 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

eastern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business while our landfill line of business reflected a modest increase the year ended december 31 2010 includes revenue of 208 million associated with divested locations the year ended december 31 2009 includes revenue of 619 million associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue increased 16 million for the year ended december 31 2010 versus 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 operating margins were 235 versus 228 in 2009 the increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor benefits disposal transportation repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures as well as lower risk insurance costs partially offset by the loss on the disposition of assets of 150 million in 2010 compared to the gain of 40 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold and an 120 million recovery of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility that reduced our landfill operating costs during the third quarter of 2009 

 

midwestern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except landfill while price associated with municipal solid waste volumes increased during 2010 this increase was offset by a higher mix of special waste volumes however the increase in revenue from core price for the year ended december 31 2010 was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business landfill volumes increased for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to special waste event driven work the year ended december 31 2010 includes revenues of 225 million associated with divested locations the year ended december 31 2009 includes revenue of 315 million associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue decreased 11 million for the year ended december 31 2010 versus 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 operating margins were 228 versus 207 in 2009 the increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor benefits disposal transportation and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures as well as lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 106 million in 2010 compared to a favorable adjustment of 14 million in 2009 partially offset by the lower gain on the disposition of assets of 93 million in 2010 compared to a gain of 271 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold 

southern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except transfer station however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines especially in our collection and landfill lines of business contributing to the decline in revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was 304 million of revenue associated with divested locations excluding the effect of the divested revenue revenue decreased 385 million for the year ended december 31 2010 versus 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 operating margins were 244 versus 256 in 2009 the decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of 18 million in the 2010 period compared to the gain of 298 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold partially offset by lower labor benefits disposal and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures and lower risk insurance costs 

 

western region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines especially in our collection and transfer station lines of business landfill volumes in 2010 increased primarily due to special waste event driven work the year ended december 31 2009 includes revenues of 110 million associated with divested locations excluding the divested revenue revenue increased 296 million for the year ended december 31 2010 versus 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 operating margins were 238 versus 268 in 2009 the decrease in operating margins is primarily attributed to the loss on disposition of assets of 09 million in 2010 compared to the gain of 881 million in 2009 as well as higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold partially offset by lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 60 million in 2010 compared to an unfavorable adjustment of 64 million in 2009 additionally we recorded a 52 million remediation charge in 2009 related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california 

 

corporate entities 

 

the changes in net revenue relates to our national accounts program serviced by third parties included in our gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 are transaction related expenses from the disposition of assets in our other segments additionally during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded an impairment loss of 144 million related to certain longlived assets that are held and used 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

eastern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of business especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 

 

in 2009 we realized a 40 million net gain from the disposition of assets which increased operating margins by 02 we also recovered 120 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the countywide facility in ohio which increased operating margins by 06 

 

in 2008 we incurred a 999 million charge for environmental conditions at the countywide facility which reduced our operating margin for the year ended december 31 2008 by 101 we incurred a 759 million charge related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon negotiations with the 

oepa and epa which reduced our operating margin by 77 we also incurred 110 million in legal settlement costs which decreased operating margins by 11 

 

the remaining increase in operating margins is attributed to lower fuel disposal and selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher labor and facilities expense 

 

midwestern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of business especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 

 

in 2009 we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of 271 million which increased operating margins by 15 otherwise the improvement in operating margin for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily due to lower transportation fuel and selling general and administrative expenses the increase in operating margin was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

 

southern region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of business especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of 298 million which impacted operating margins by 15 we also realized in 2009 an 88 million favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations which increased our operating margin by 04 otherwise the improvement in operating margin for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily due to lower disposal transport and fuel costs partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

 

western region 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business however the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in all lines of business especially in our industrial and landfill lines of business we also experienced declines in fuel surcharges 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we realized gains from the disposition of assets of 881 million which increased operating margins by 41 partially offsetting these gains was an unfavorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 64 million reducing operating margin by 03 and remediation charges totaling 52 million reducing operating margin by 03 related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california in addition lower landfill revenue which has higher margins than our collection line of business negatively impacted 2009 margins 

 

in the second quarter of 2008 we incurred a 340 million charge at the sunrise landfill and a 219 million charge at our closed disposal facility in california for environmental conditions at each of these locations the charges reduced operating margin by 59 margins were favorably impacted by lower labor fuel transportation and selling general and administrative expenses offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

corporate entities 

 

the increase in net revenue relates to allied’s national accounts program the increase in depreciation amortization depletion and accretion expense and the increase in the operating loss are attributable to the allied acquisition included in our gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net for the year ended december 31 2009 are transaction related expenses of 82 million from the disposition of assets in the other segments and a 37 million charge for the asset impairment associated with our former corporate office in florida 

 

landfill and environmental matters 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or operated 193 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 47 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers using information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2010 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 46 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 01 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information during 2010 total available airspace increased by a net 01 billion cubic yards primarily due to new expansions and net acquisitions offset by airspace consumed and divestitures 

 

during 2009 total available airspace decreased by a net 03 billion cubic yards primarily due to divestitures closures and airspace consumed partially offset by new expansions 

 

during 2008 total available airspace increased by a net 32 billion cubic yards due to the allied acquisition in december which contributed 157 active landfills representing 33 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace excluding the allied acquisition total available airspace related to republic’s preacquisition operations decreased by a net 01 billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates and changes in design the decrease during 2008 due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at the countywide facility 

at december 31 2007 111 of our total available airspace or 02 billion cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills at december 31 2010 31 of our total available airspace or 01 billion cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills between december 31 2007 and december 31 2010 we received permits for 19 of our probable expansions which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

as of december 31 2010 eight of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 48 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 55 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of december 31 2010 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10465 million of which 939 million is current and 9526 million is longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

 

in december 2009 we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied or a predecessor company that it had acquired had been identified as a potentially responsible party the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring see also note 2 summary of significant accounting policies – environmental remediation liabilities for further information we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 975 discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 

 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

 

countywide landfill in september 2009 republic services of ohio ii llc entered into final findings and orders with the ohio environmental protection agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december 31 2010 is 684 million of which 71 million is expected to be paid during 2011 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 59 million to 81 million 

west contra costa county landfill in 2006 we were issued an enforcement order by the california department of toxic substance control dtsc for the class 1 hazardous waste cell at the west contra costa county landfill west county subsequently we entered into a consent agreement with dtsc in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain remedial actions the remediation liability for west county recorded as of december 31 2010 is 465 million of which 25 million is expected to be paid during 2011 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 36 million to 63 million 

 

sunrise landfill in august 2008 republic services of southern nevada rssn signed a consent decree with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill under the consent decree rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county were otherwise jointly and severally liable we also paid 10 million in sanctions related to the consent decree rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree however we have not recorded any potential recoveries the remediation liability for sunrise recorded as of december 31 2010 is 375 million of which 230 million is expected to be paid during 2011 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 29 million to 44 million 

 

congress landfill in august 2010 congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order final order entered by the circuit court of illinois cook county pursuant to the final order we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded as of december 31 2010 is 826 million of which 84 million is expected to be paid during 2011 we believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is 46 million to 146 million 

 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 our average compaction rate was approximately 1800 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average as compared to 1700 pounds per cubic yard for the year ended december 31 2009 based on our threeyear historical moving average our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

 

as of december 31 2010 we expect to spend an estimated additional 61 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 93 billion or 196 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method

capital expenditures capital expenditures during 2010 were 7947 million compared with 8263 million in 2009 and 3869 million in 2008 capital expenditures in 2009 were higher than 2008 due to the allied acquisition in december 2008 during 2011 we expect our capital expenditures to approximate 870 million however we expect property and equipment received during 2011 to be 750 million which excludes 120 million of property and equipment received during 2010 but paid during 2011 

 

proceeds from sales of property and equipment proceeds on sale of property and equipment during 2010 were 374 million compared with 318 million in 2009 and 82 million in 2008 proceeds on sale of property and equipment in 2010 were higher than 2009 due to the sale of our former headquarters building in florida proceeds on sale of property in 2009 were higher than 2008 due to the allied acquisition in december 2008

change in restricted cash and marketable securities changes in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances which are largely related to the issuance of taxexempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance contributed 663 million and 416 million to our investing activities in 2010 and 2009 compared to a 53 million use of cash in 2008 funds received from issuances of taxexempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance as we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets proceeds from bond issuances into restricted trust accounts represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows during 2010 and 2009 our reimbursements from restricted cash accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of taxexempt bonds 

 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 

 

cash flows provided by used in financing activities 

 

the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows from financing activities for the periods presented are summarized 

 

net debt repayments or borrowings payments of notes payable and longterm debt net of proceeds from notes payable and longterm debt and issuance of senior notes were 3974 million in 2010 versus 8659 million in 2009 and net borrowing of 7128 million in 2008 during 2010 we issued 8500 million of 500 senior notes due 2020 and 6500 million of 620 senior notes due 2040 we used the net proceeds from the notes as follows i 4337 million to redeem the 6125 senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102042 4250 million principal outstanding ii 6218 million to redeem the 7250 senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103625 6000 million principal outstanding and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes during 2010 we also we repaid all borrowings and terminated our accounts receivable securitization program and we refinanced 6774 million and repaid 978 million of our taxexempt financings 

 

during 2009 we issued 6500 million of 5500 senior notes due 2019 and 6000 million of 5250 senior notes due 2021 the primary use of proceeds from the notes together with draws on our credit facilities was to purchase and retire i 3255 million of varied senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 pursuant to our september 2009 tender offer ii 4500 million of 7875 of senior notes due 2013 iii 4000 million of 7375 senior notes due 2014 iv 2300 million of 4250 senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 and v repurchase certain of our senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market additionally our senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7125 matured during 2009 we repaid the remaining principal balance of 993 million in may 2009 net borrowings reflected in our cash flows provided by financing activities in 2008 were primarily related to the allied acquisition we used proceeds from our revolver to refinance extensions of credit under allied’s senior credit facility to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition 

 

premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior notes cash premiums and fees paid in connection with the issuance of our 2020 and 2040 notes premiums paid for note redemptions and fees paid to issue taxexempt indebtedness were 566 million during 2010 in connection with the issuance of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in 2009 we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling 616 million 

purchase of common stock for treasury from 2000 through 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 26 billion of our common stock as of december 31 2008 we had paid 23 billion to repurchase 826 million shares of our common stock of which 1384 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase 46 million shares the stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of 2008 due to the pending allied acquisition in november 2010 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 4000 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through december 31 2011 as of december 31 2010 we have repurchased 14 million shares for 411 million at a weighted average cost per share of 2846 we expect to use the remaining funds under this program to repurchase shares during 2011 

 

cash dividends paid we initiated a quarterly cash dividend in july 2003 the dividend has been increased from time to time thereafter in july 2010 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 020 per share dividends paid were 2946 million 2883 million and 1283 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had 883 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1728 million of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 398 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 

 

our 10 billion revolving credit facility due april 2012 and our 175 billion revolving credit facility due september 2013 collectively credit facilities bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was 156 and 162 respectively our credit facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments regardless of usage availability under our credit facilities can be used for working capital capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes we had 750 million and 3000 million of eurodollar rate borrowings and nil and 154 million of base rate borrowings as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we had 10375 million and 16340 million of letters of credit utilizing availability under our credit facilities leaving 16375 million and 8006 million of availability under our credit facilities at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity at december 31 2010 our ebitda to interest ratio was 464 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 285 compared to the 325 maximum allowed by the covenants at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and we expect to be in compliance during 2011 

 

ebitda which is a nongaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

 

in march 2010 we issued 8500 million of 500 senior notes due 2020 the 2020 notes and 6500 million of 620 senior notes due 2040 the 2040 notes and together with the 2020 notes the notes the notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on march 1 2020 in the case of the 2020 notes and march 1 2040 in the case of the 2040 notes interest is payable semiannually on march 1 and september 1 beginning september 1 2010 the notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantees our credit facilities these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors 

 

we used the net proceeds from the notes as follows i 4337 million to redeem the 6125 senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102042 4250 million principal outstanding ii 6218 million to redeem the 

7250 senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103625 6000 million principal outstanding and iii the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes we incurred a loss of 1321 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes 

 

in march 2010 we repaid all borrowings and terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with two financial institutions that allowed us to borrow up to 3000 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 02 million related to unamortized deferred issuance costs associated with terminating this program 

 

to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 2100 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 675 our swap agreements mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2010 we had 11518 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at prevailing market rates ranging from 028 to 825 at december 31 2010 and have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2035 as of december 31 2010 we had 398 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we refinanced 6774 million and repaid 978 million of our taxexempt financings resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 285 million related to charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate these transactions 

 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable any early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

 

fuel hedges 

 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges 

the following fuel hedges were outstanding during 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price as published by the department of energy exceeds the contract price per gallon we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counterparty if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from thirdparty counterparties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy the aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at december 31 2010 and 2009 were current assets of 16 million and 32 million respectively and accrued liabilities of 19 million and 49 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2010 and 2009 net of tax of 02 million and 10 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income realized losses gains of 20 million 73 million and 59 million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

during 2010 approximately 7 of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements additionally we were able to recover approximately 66 of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 

 

recycling commodity hedges 

 

revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted occ and onp sales the agreements qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales commodity hedges 

the following commodity swaps were outstanding during 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

if the price per short ton of the hedging instrument average price as reported on the official board market is less than the contract price per short ton we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional short tons from the counterparty if the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our commodity swaps are obtained from thirdparty counterparties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

 

on december 8 2010 we entered into a twoyear costless collar agreement on forecasted sales of 10000 short tons of occ a month the agreement involves combining a purchased put option giving us the right to sell 10000 short tons of occ monthly for 24 months at an established floor strike price with a written call option obligating us to deliver 10000 short tons of occ monthly for 24 months at an established cap strike price the puts and calls have the same settlement dates are net settled in cash on such date and have the same terms to expiration the contemporaneous combination of options resulted in no net premium for us and represents a costless collar under the agreement we will not make or receive any payment as long as the settlement price is between the floor price and cap price however if the settlement price is above the cap we would be required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly volumes hedged also if the settlement price is below the floor the counterparty would be required to pay us the deficit of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly volumes hedged the objective of this agreement is to reduce the variability of the cash flows of the forecasted sales of occ between two designated strike prices 

 

the following costless collar hedges were outstanding at december 31 2010 

 

 

the costless collar hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value the fair values of the costless collars are obtained from the thirdparty counterparty and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based upon forward commodity price curves in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

 

the aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges at december 31 2010 and 2009 were current assets of 19 million and 18 million respectively and current liabilities of 65 million and 08 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values of our commodity hedges as of december 31 2010 and 2009 net of tax of 26 million and 06 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2010 and 2009 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income 

 

approximately 20 of our 2010 tonnage sales volume of commodities were subject to cash flow hedges 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 in millions 

 

 

 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments share repurchases and debt repayments debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 

 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 

 

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2010 

 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

 

in addition to the above we have unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 of 2228 million due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at 

december 31 2010 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 

 

we also have letters of credit of 11 billion of which 10 billion utilize availability under our credit facilities at december 31 2010 

 

debt covenants 

 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2010 we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2011 

 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

financial assurance 

 

we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies or trust deposits the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states will require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 

 

additionally we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2011 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness because we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

 

for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is as follows in millions 

 

 

 

the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

contingencies 

 

for a description of our contingencies see note 10 income taxes and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k 

 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies 

that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

 

accounting for the allied acquisition 

 

acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 

 

we have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition adjustments if any to our estimates of fair values and the resulting purchase price allocation in future periods will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment other intangible assets landfill asset retirement obligations legal and environmental reserves selfinsurance reserves income taxes other noncurrent assets and longterm obligations and assets held for sale our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december 31 2010 a portion of which will be paid in future periods

landfill accounting 

 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 

 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 

  

landfill development costs 

 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

 

site permits in order to develop construct and operate a landfill we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by 

our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

 

residual risks 

 

  

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas 

collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

 

residual risk 

 

  

landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

 

residual risk 

 

  

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

 

the initial liabilities recorded as part of the allied acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time during 2009 we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding our remediation sites and as a result increased the fair value of our closure and postclosure reserves by 723 million any further adjustments to our reserves resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods in which such adjustments become known 

 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index 25 in both 2010 and 2009 

 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 55 in 2010 and 75 in 2009 

 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

 69 

 

  

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

 

in connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations we made a change in estimate which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle this change which we believe is preferable was made to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event this change resulted in a 326 million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

permitted and probable disposal capacity as described previously disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows 

 

  

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill 

amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

 

residual risk 

 

  

environmental liabilities 

 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

 

the environmental liabilities assumed from allied relate to impacts at both owned and unowned sites in the case of owned sites we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory entity under the applicable regulations typically rcra or cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues at unowned sites we are working within the regulatory and procedural framework established by cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues in conjunction with other potentially liable parties at each location pursuant to the purchase method of accounting we have recorded the environmental remediation liabilities assumed from allied based upon estimates of their fair value using an estimate of future cash flows or settlement previously and consistent with our method of accounting allied recorded remediation liabilities based upon accounting for loss contingencies however amounts recorded under this method are generally not at fair value 

 

since the date of acquisition our process for deriving fair value for the environmental liabilities assumed from allied included first identifying the population of remediation sites where we are either fully or partially responsible for remediation or potential remediation the population of remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on i the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages in the applicable regulation typically cercla or rcra and ii the extent of our participation in the remediation activity using these categories we applied one of the following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value 

 

 71 

 

  

the initial liabilities recorded as part of the allied acquisition were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time during 2009 we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding allied’s remediation sites in certain situations we used external engineers and attorneys to assist in the development of our fair value estimates as a result of the process we increased the fair value of our remediation reserves by 1819 million any further adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known 

 

residual risks 

 

  

selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured accruals for selfinsurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 10 million to 30 million 

 

residual risks 

 

  

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

 

residual risks 

 

  

asset impairment 

 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

 

residual risk 

 

  

evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

 

residual risk 

 

  

recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

 

goodwill recoverability 

 

we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists we test goodwill for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern midwestern southern and western in determining fair value we primarily utilize discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 3 to 5 ii future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40 iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital iv estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 8 and 10 and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but are not limited to i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2010 we determined that our indicated fair value of equity exceeded our market capitalization we determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market price on december 31 2010 we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of equity and our market capitalization is due to a control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and  or synergies by obtaining control and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 

 

as of december 31 2010 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of 120 to in excess of 170 and as such we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

 

we will continuously monitor market trends in our business the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill additionally we would then be required to review our remaining longlived assets for impairment 

 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment

income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

 

regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

residual risks 

 

  

defined benefit pension plans 

 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and irc as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 

 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee at december 31 2010 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash we annually review and adjust the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was 77 million as of december 31 2010 compared to 314 million as of december 31 2009 

 

residual risk 

 

  

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

 

we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate were to increase by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 33 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 39 million 

 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the 

table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” 

 

 

 

the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining noncash discounts premiums adjustments to fair value related to hedging transactions and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 2740 million 

 

fuel price risk 

 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new or renew contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

 

at our current consumption levels a onecent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 15 million on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

commodities prices 

 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities as a result changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations revenue from sales of these products in 2010 2009 and 2008 were approximately 3071 million 1812 million and 1211 million respectively

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

report of management on republic services inc’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

we as members of management of republic services inc are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

we under the supervision of and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the specified criteria 

 

our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their attestation report which is included herein 

 

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

overview 

 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 376 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we own or operate 223 transfer stations 192 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities we also operate 74 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 56 billion of which approximately 58 is generated by publicly owned waste companies we believe that we and one other public waste company generated in excess of 60 of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue additionally industry data indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 16 and 26 respectively of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation and is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business therefore the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we can drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer we implement this strategy through an organizational structure that groups our operations within a corporate region and area structure we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments which are also our reportable segments eastern midwest southern and western the boundaries of our operating segments have changed and may continue to change from time to time each of our regions is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe this structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy and allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

 

on december 5 2008 we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of allied in a stockforstock transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 121 billion which included approximately 54 billion of debt at fair value as a condition of the merger with allied the department of justice doj required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities as of september 30 2009 we completed our required divestitures as a result of our acquisition of allied we committed to a restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other administrative and operating functions the plan included closing our corporate office in florida consolidating administrative functions to arizona the former headquarters of allied and reducing staffing levels the plan also included closing and consolidating certain operating locations and terminating certain leases we believe that our merger with allied created a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 

 

we had revenue of 82 billion and 37 billion and operating income of 16 billion and 03 billion for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition to our merger with allied a number of 

items impacted our 2009 and 2008 financial results for a description of these items see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview of our business and consolidated results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

during the past several years we supported our internal growth strategy with our presence in markets with higher than average population growth we believe our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than those of declining population growth 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies in order to ensure that our goals relative to these strategies are achieved we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on realizing key performance metrics which include increasing free cash flow achieving targeted earnings maintaining and improving returns on invested capital as well as achieving and maintaining integration synergies our financial operating and growth strategies are described further herein 

 

financial strategy 

 

key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt paying cash dividends repurchasing our stock and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine management’s compensation 

 

we manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on invested capital our strategy includes 

 

  

price growth growth through price increases helps ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial capital investment and the business risk associated with such investment price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs which ultimately enhances our operating margins 

 

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers but also includes investing in information 

tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while ensuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

 

  

  

for certain risks related to our financial strategy see item 1a risk factors  

 

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following 

 

 4 

 

  

experienced executive management team we believe that we have one of the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste industry 

 

james e o’connor who has served as our chief executive officer ceo since december 1998 also became our chairman in january 2003 he worked at waste management inc from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr o’connor has 35 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

donald w slager became our president and chief operating officer coo upon our merger with allied in december 2008 prior to the merger mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president and coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations he held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 24 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

tod c holmes has served as our chief financial officer cfo since august 1998 mr holmes served as our vice president of finance from june 1998 until august 1998 and as vice president of finance of our former parent company’s solid waste group from january 1998 until june 1998 from 1987 to 1998 mr holmes served in various management positions with browningferris industries inc including vice president investor relations from 1996 to 1998 divisional vice president collection operations from 1995 to 1996 divisional vice president and regional controller — northern region from 1993 to 1995 and divisional vice president and assistant corporate controller from 1991 to 1993 mr holmes has over 22 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

our regional senior vice presidents have an average of 22 years of experience in the industry 

 

continuing merger integration strategy on december 5 2008 we completed our merger with allied we believe that our merger integration strategy is well underway and we continue to believe this merger is different from historical attempts to consolidate the waste industry for a number of reasons including the following 

 

 5 

  

  

decentralized management structure we rely on a decentralized management structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our daytoday operations more efficiently our local management has extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic markets each regional management team includes a senior vice president vice presidentcontroller vice president of human resources vice president of sales vice president of operations support director of safety director of engineering and environmental management and director of market planning and development we believe that our strong regional management teams allow us to more effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout our organization our regional management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective geographic markets compensation for our area management teams is primarily based on improving operating income produced and the free cash flow and return on invested capital generated in each manager’s geographic area of responsibility in addition through longterm incentive programs including stock options we believe we have achieved one of the lowest turnover levels in the industry for our local management teams as a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating our customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas throughout our operations to improve operating margins 

 

integrated operations we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through disposal we expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our nonintegrated markets through acquisitions landfill operating agreements and other market development activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection companies transfer stations and landfills we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of waste volume we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in which we have 

significant collection operations or in markets that we determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 68 and 58 respectively of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate internalization this increase in internalization is due to a higher concentration of integrated hauling and landfill operations acquired in our merger with allied in a number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities flowcontrol this provides us with an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing in landfill capacity because we do not have landfill facilities or governmentcontrolled disposal facilities for all markets in which we provide collection services we believe that landfill and transfer station acquisitions operating agreements and market development give us the opportunity to increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our operations by further integrating operations in existing markets we may be able to reduce our disposal costs 

 

economies of scale cost efficiencies and asset utilization we continue to identify and implement best practices throughout our organization with the goal of permanently improving overall operating and financial results these best practice initiatives focus on critical areas of our operations such as landfill operations truck routing maintenance and related service efficiencies purchasing and administrative activities the consolidation of acquired businesses into existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used for truck routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories and backoffice administration generally we consolidate our acquired administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs of particular benefit are the opportunities associated with the blending of operations as a result of the allied merger scheduled for full completion by the first half of 2010 these markets offer the potential for marked improvement in operating results generally speaking there are significant opportunities in these markets to leverage economies of scale and the existing asset base while realizing improved operating efficiencies upon the completion of the integration of allied our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative costs at no more than 100 of revenue which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform in addition our procurement initiatives ensure that we negotiate the best volume discounts for goods and services purchased including waste disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties furthermore we have taken steps to maximize the utilization of our assets for example to reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of our fleet and drivers we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operating density by using assets more efficiently operating expenses can be reduced 

 

high levels of customer satisfaction we strive to provide the highest level of service to our customer base our policy is to periodically visit each commercial account to ensure customer satisfaction and to verify that we are providing the appropriate level of service in addition to visiting existing customers a salesperson develops a base of prospective customers within each market we also have municipal marketing representatives in most service areas that are responsible for working with each municipality or community to which we provide residential service to ensure customer satisfaction additionally the municipal representatives organize and drive the effort to obtain new or renew municipal contracts in their service areas 

 

focus on systems utilization we continue to invest in the integration and expansion of our information systems and technology platform our future platform will consist of bestinclass legacy systems from both republic and allied during 2009 we converted the entire company to a single payable and general ledger system additionally we made significant progress in converting to a single operating system we expect to complete our operating system conversion by the third quarter of 2010 in addition during january 2010 we converted the entire company to a single payroll and human resource system our future technology related initiatives will include customer relationship management billing productivity and maintenance systems we believe that the combination of these systems will prove to be a competitive advantage for our company 

 

for certain risks related to our operating strategy see item 1a risk factors 

growth strategy 

 

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions we manage our growth strategy as follows 

 

internal growth our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining existing customers and obtaining new commercial municipal and industrial customers through our wellmanaged sales and marketing activities 

 

  

acquisition growth we look to acquire businesses that complement our existing business platform our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on privately held solid waste companies and the waste operations of municipal and other local governmental authorities we believe that our ability to acquire privately held companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry increasing capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for these privately held companies’ owners we also seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are privatizing as they seek to increase available capital and reduce risk in addition we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publicly owned waste companies in sum our acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on the following 

 

 8 

 

  

we also seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

for certain risks related to our growth strategy see item 1a risk factors 

 

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 376 collection companies in 2009 769 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 35 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 40 is from services provided to commercial customers and 25 is from services provided to industrial and other customers 

 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors collection frequency type of equipment furnished the type and volume or weight of the waste collected transportation costs the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 

 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

we also provide recycling services in certain markets in compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

transfer and disposal services we own or operate 223 transfer stations we deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities in 2009 transfer and disposal services accounted for 189 of our revenue 

 

as of december 31 2009 we owned or operated 192 active landfills which had approximately 35000 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 46 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain 

expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

we also have responsibility for 132 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure obligations 

 

landfill gas and renewable energy projects during 2009 we brought eleven landfill gastoenergy projects on line bringing our total number of such projects to 74 or over one third of our active landfills these projects consist of the following 

 

  

our 51 electric projects generate 323 megawatts of electricity enough to power approximately 192000 homes our 23 other projects provide or process more than 58000 square cubic feet per minute of gas enough to heat almost 200000 homes the environmental benefit of all of our projects combined is the equivalent of removing nearly 4 million cars from the road 

 

during 2009 we also combined a firstofitskind solar technology with an existing gastoenergy system which turned our tessman road landfill in san antonio texas into a sustainable energy park a closed portion of the landfill is now capped with a solar energy cover developed by republic which generates electricity for homes and businesses in the surrounding area we expect to install a similar system at one or more of our landfills during 2010 

 

many of our landfills that do not have gastoenergy or renewable energy projects are capable of supporting such projects as a result we intend to bring several of these projects on line each year for many years to come 

 

recycling facilities and other services we own or operate 78 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding our business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 1000 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

most of our marketing activity is local in nature however we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of some of our national and regional customers our national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with our national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize procurement costs with our extended geographic reach our national accounts program effectively serves 40 states and puerto rico as industry leaders our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 

 

we generally do not change the trade names of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or trade name 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to a broad base of commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 5 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry require substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publicly owned companies including waste management inc several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies and thousands of small privately owned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate these permits are subject to denial revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including 

criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local authorities administer these regulations 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws regulations and permits however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities we cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves refer to the contractual obligations table within item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contained elsewhere herein for further information 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes that affect our facilities and operations 

 

  

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to submit to the epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 

 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

  

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so 

in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

cercla liability is strict liability it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste it is likely that hazardous substances have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other properties owned by third parties where we have transported to and disposed of waste or at our landfills or at other properties that we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in 

landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries electronic wastes and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the us congress and the epa 

 

to construct operate and expand a landfill we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals these permits and approvals may be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to denial modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills we may be required to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

other regulations many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdiction lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional in 2007 the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may in some cases cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations 

 

liabilities established for landfill and environmental costs we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and we cannot assure you that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held 

responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers’ liability workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 31000 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements from time to time our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business our management believes that we have good relations with our employees

we have substantial indebtedness which may limit our financial flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 74 billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing dividends selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

 

the downturn in the us economy may continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results 

 

a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated in 2009 weakness in the us economy had a negative effect on our revenue operating results and operating cash flows the current and previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities as a result of the global economic crisis we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows further we cannot assure you that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate or any improvement in our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts and others 

 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be 

unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counterparty risk associated with our derivatives 

 

to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates we have entered into a number of derivative agreements these derivative agreements require us or the counterparty to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates vary from a specified amount a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counterparties with which we do business potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies municipalities and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for disposal business is primarily based on disposal costs geographic location and quality of operations some of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than us many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues it could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability 

 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

 

we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs including fuel and environmental costs to improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors may reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices as a result we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases we may also lose volume to lowercost competitors 

 

increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals will increase our operating expenses and we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 

 

we depend on fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal we buy fuel in the open market fuel prices are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries and regional production patterns we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges for example our fuel costs were 3498 million in 2009 representing 72 of our cost of operations compared to 2353 million in 2008 representing 97 of our cost of operations  this decrease in fuel costs as a percent of our cost of operations primarily reflects a decrease in the price of fuel 

in order to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counterparties if the price of fuel varies from a specified amount however we do not hedge our entire fuel usage during 2009 only 64 of our fuel purchases were hedged 

 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions and in october 2009 the epa indicated it will establish the first us standards for greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles the regulations could affect the type of fuel our trucks use and could materially increase the cost and consumption of our fuel our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting in the future from climate change any of which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

 

we currently have matters pending with the internal revenue service the “irs” which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 

 

we are currently under examination by the irs with regard to allied’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2007 and 2008 and allied’s 2000 through 2006 federal income tax returns are at appeals republic is under audit for its 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns and under examination for its 2008 federal income tax return 

 

during its examination of allied’s 2002 tax year the irs asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in wastetoenergy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs the company believes its position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter the potential tax and interest through december 31 2009 to the extent unpaid have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet a disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations however a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made the accrual of additional interest charges through the time this matter is resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations in addition the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

additionally during its examination of allied’s 2000 through 2003 tax years the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills the irs’ position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and therefore associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed we believe we have several meritorious defenses including the fact that methane gas is 

not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services therefore we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

for additional information on these matters see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy depends on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate that we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends or that we will be able to reinstitute our share repurchase program 

 

a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 

 

while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term if the rating agencies downgrade our debt this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt if our debt ratings are downgraded future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost or at all also may be adversely impacted 

 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we expend on capital capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

 

over the last several years regulations have been adopted mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions these regulations have caused some increases in the costs of the collection vehicles we buy the epa recently has indicated it intends to adopt further regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles as a result we could experience an increase in capital costs this also could cause an increase in vehicle operating costs or a reduction in operating efficiency we may reduce the number of vehicles we purchase until manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase efficiency 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

 

we cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate nonhazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities maintaining permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our nonhazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such accruals and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amount accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose such a shortfall could result in significant unanticipated charges to income additionally if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at current volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 

 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting and recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills although such actions are useful in protecting our environment these actions as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives have and may in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas if this occurs we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 

 

we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise in future periods we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

 

complying with laws and regulations governing the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and may in the future continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 

 

efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs to ameliorate the effect of climate change continue to advance on the federal regional and state level our landfill operations emit methane identified as a ghg in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed a bill that would regulate ghgs comprehensively while the centerpiece of that bill would be a ghg emission allowance capandtrade system landfills would not be compelled to hold allowances for their ghg emissions rather they would be subject to certain further emission controls to be determined through administrative rulemaking senate passage of counterpart legislation and whether such legislation would treat landfills in the same manner is uncertain should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted we expect it to impose costs on our operations the materiality of which we cannot predict 

 

absent comprehensive federal legislation to control ghg emissions epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority in october 2009 epa published a proposed prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule “psd tailoring rule” the proposed rule would set new thresholds for ghg emissions that define when clean air act permits would be required and 

would “tailor” these programs to limit which facilities would be required to obtain permits epa’s legal authority to “tailor” this rule in the manner it proposed has been challenged if finalized as proposed many of our landfills would be subject to the psd tailoring rule which could require permit amendments and additional emission controls in december 2009 epa finalized its finding that six ghgs endanger public health while epa made its finding in the context of regulating air emissions from motor vehicles other clean air act provisions appear to compel epa to make comparable findings for stationary sources such as landfills we cannot predict the requirements or effective date of stationary source rules that might apply to landfills as a result of this endangerment finding and accordingly we cannot assure you that further developments in this area will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” on parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed of and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar laws in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are and from time to time become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience difficulties completing the integration of allied’s business and we may incur unexpected expenses in connection with that integration 

 

achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with allied will depend significantly on whether we can continue to integrate allied’s business in an efficient and effective manner the ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be fully realized we may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly successfully or on a timely basis any inability of our management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may not realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits from the merger with allied fully or within the timing anticipated 

 

we believe our merger with allied has been and will continue to be beneficial to our stockholders as a result of the actual and anticipated synergies resulting from the combined operations while we are currently ahead of our original timeline we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or the longterm strategic benefits of the merger fully or within the timing anticipated for example elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated for at least the first year after an acquisition and possibly longer the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations the inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger or our encountering unexpected costs or delays in the integration process which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates as such we cannot assure you that 

 

  

if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our due diligence investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by 

conducting due diligence by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management actual results could differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation employee benefit and pension plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance 

 

we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 

 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 27 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 

 

we contribute to at least 25 multiemployer pension plans covering at least 17 of our current employees we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 the ppa requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios based on the information available to us we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either “critical” or “endangered” as those terms are defined in the ppa we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period furthermore under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each a “withdrawal event” we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a withdrawal event the amounts we would be 

required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and growth prospects

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in routine judicial and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and that relate to among other things personal injury or property damage claims employment matters and commercial and contractual disputes we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations due to the nature of our business we are also routinely a party to judicial or administrative proceedings involving governmental authorities and other interested parties related to environmental regulations or liabilities from time to time we may also be subject to actions brought by citizens’ groups adjacent landowners or others in connection with the permitting and licensing of our landfills or transfer stations or alleging personal injury environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate 

 

we are subject to various federal state and local tax rules and regulations these rules are extensive and often complex and we are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by taxing authorities accordingly we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities if upon audit any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 

the following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty except as otherwise described below we do not believe that the outcome of our pending litigation environmental and other administrative proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

litigation environmental and other administrative matters 

 

countywide matters 

 

on march 26 2007 the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued final findings and orders fos to republic services of ohio ii llc republicohio an ohio limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary the fos related to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum production waste at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide in east sparta ohio the fos and certain other remedial actions republicohio agreed with the oepa to undertake to address the environmental conditions included without limitation the following actions a prohibiting leachate recirculation b refraining from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the site c updating engineering plans and specifications and providing further information regarding the integrity of various engineered components at the site d performing additional data collection e taking additional measures to address emissions f expanding the gas collection and control system g installing an isolation break h removing liquids from gas extraction wells and i submitting a plan to the oepa to suppress the chemical reaction and following approval by the oepa implementing such plan republicohio has performed certain interim remedial actions required by the oepa republicohio subsequently received additional orders from the oepa requiring certain actions to be taken by republicohio in addition to or in lieu of requirements contained in prior orders including additional air quality monitoring and the installation and continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems 

 

on september 30 2009 republicohio entered into two legally binding agreements with the state of ohio designed to further refine the activities necessary to resolve alleged compliance and licensing issues at the countywide facility 

 

the first agreement is a consent order that resolves ongoing allegations of noncompliance at the facility and reflects agreements regarding the status of facility licensing the allegations of noncompliance were summarized in a complaint that was filed by the ohio attorney general in the stark county court of common pleas and resolved the same day in accordance with terms of an agreed upon consent order entered into between republicohio and the state of ohio the consent order with ohio requires republicohio to pay civil penalties and financial relief of 100 million submit updated permit documents and assess evaluate and determine the appropriate time to address certain compliance issues at the facility all civil penalties and financial relief required by the consent order have been satisfied compliance with the terms of the consent order and other applicable rules will result in countywide being considered to be in substantial compliance or on a legally enforceable schedule to return to compliance for annual licensing purposes 

 

the second agreement is a set of fos that were agreed to and entered into with the ohio epa the fos require the implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance program that contains specific requirements for managing the remediation area the operation and maintenance program is ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure of the 88acre remediation area at countywide the september 30 2009 fos supersede all previous fos discussed above that were issued to republicohio regarding the reaction in the remediation area of the landfill the operation and maintenance program requires countywide to among other things maintain the temporary cap and other engineering controls designed to prevent odors and isolate and contain the reaction the operation and maintenance program also contains provisions that require the installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when conditions become conducive to such installation 

 

republicohio has also entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republicohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system b design and install a composite cap or cover and c develop and implement an air monitoring program the aoc became effective on april 17 2008 and republicohio has 

complied with the terms of the aoc republicohio also has completed construction of an isolation break under the authority and supervision of the epa and reimbursed the epa for certain costs associated with the epa’s involvement in overseeing implementation of the aoc on november 20 2009 the epa issued a notification of completion and determination of compliance to countywide memorializing countywide’s completion of the work required under the aoc 

 

the commissioner of the stark county health department commissioner previously recommended that the stark county board of health board of health suspend countywide’s 2007 annual operating license the commissioner also intended to recommend that the board of health deny countywide’s license application for 2008 republicohio obtained a preliminary injunction on november 28 2007 prohibiting the board of health from suspending its 2007 operating license republicohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on february 15 2008 prohibiting the board of health from denying its 2008 operating license application the litigation with the board of health has been concluded pursuant to a consent order entered into between republicohio and the board of health in the stark county court of common pleas the consent order requires the board of health to issue conditional andor final operating licenses to countywide and requires republicohio to reimburse the board of health for certain expenses not to exceed 300000 incurred related to monitoring and investigation of complaints regarding countywide countywide’s 2009 operating license has been challenged by tuscarawas county and the board of health issued countywide its 2010 operating license on december 30 2009 which also has been challenged by a local citizens’ group club 3000 

 

we believe that we have performed or are diligently performing all actions required under the fos the aoc and any applicable consent orders and that countywide does not pose a threat to the environment additionally we believe that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating license at countywide 

 

in a suit filed on october 8 2008 in the tuscarawas county ohio court of common pleas approximately 700 plaintiffs have named republic services inc and republicohio as defendants the claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from the operation of countywide republicohio has owned and operated countywide since february 1 1999 waste management inc and waste management ohio inc previous owners and operators of countywide have been named as defendants as well plaintiffs are individuals and businesses located in the geographic area around countywide they claim that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and operational issues and conditions the landfill has generated odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired the use and value of their property there are also allegations that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health effects a second almost identical lawsuit was filed on october 13 2009 in the tuscarawas county ohio court of common pleas with approximately 82 plaintiffs these plaintiffs named republic services inc republicohio waste management inc and waste management ohio inc as defendants the relief requested on behalf of each plaintiff in both actions is 1 an award of compensatory damages according to proof in an amount in excess of 25000 for each of the three counts of the amended complaint 2 an award of punitive damages in the amount of two times compensatory damages pursuant to applicable statute or in such amount as may be awarded at trial for each of the three counts of the amended complaint 3 costs for medical screening and monitoring of each plaintiff 4 interest on the damages according to law 5 costs and disbursements of the lawsuit 6 reasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses and 7 any other and further relief as the court deems just proper and equitable we anticipate that the two cases will be consolidated answers have been filed in both cases and discovery is ongoing 164 plaintiffs in the first case and 41 plaintiffs in the second case have been dismissed or are in the process of being dismissed for failing to comply with discovery we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’ allegations in both actions

risk management companies 

 

prior to allied’s acquisition of browning ferris industries bfi in july 1999 certain bfi operating companies as part of a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities contributed assets and existing environmental and selfinsurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs subsequently the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately 902 million for tax purposes calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 

 

on january 18 2001 the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a “potentially abusive tax shelter” under irs regulations during 2002 the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss in april 2005 the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction with respect to bfi tax years prior to the acquisition in july 2005 allied filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims cfc relating to the bfi tax years in january 2009 we paid all tax interest and penalty asserted by the irs with respect to the bfi tax years and withdrew our suit for refund in the cfc 

 

in august 2008 allied received from the irs a statutory notice of deficiency related to its utilization of bfi’s capital loss carryforward on allied’s 1999 tax return in october 2008 allied filed a suit for refund in federal district court in arizona with respect to allied’s 1999 tax year in december 2009 we reached a settlement with both the doj and irs for allied’s 1999 tax year and all subsequent tax years under the settlement the company resolved all remaining liability for this matter including federal and state tax penalty and interest for approximately 125 million we paid approximately 58 million in the first quarter of 2010 and expect to pay the remainder approximately 67 million later in 2010 while the final settlement amount is less than the amount previously accrued for this matter the accrual and the adjustment thereto are reflected in our allocation of purchase price associated with the acquisition of allied and had no impact on our consolidated statement of income 

 

exchange of partnership interests 

 

in april 2002 allied exchanged minority partnership interests in four wastetoenergy facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment purchasing businesses which are now wholly owned subsidiaries in november 2008 the irs issued a formal disallowance to allied contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a corresponding gain should have been recognized we believe our position is supported by relevant technical authorities and strong business purpose and we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter if the exchange is treated as a sale we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately 156 million plus accrued interest through december 31 2009 of approximately 59 million in addition the irs has asserted a penalty of 20 of the additional income tax due the potential tax and interest but not penalty or penaltyrelated interest of a full adjustment for this matter have been fully reserved in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

methane gas 

 

as part of its examination of allied’s 2000 through 2006 federal income tax returns the irs reviewed allied’s treatment of costs associated with its landfill operations as a result of this review the irs has proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally produced within the landfill the irs’ position is that the methane gas produced by a landfill is a joint product resulting from operation of the landfill and therefore these costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed 

 

we have protested this matter to the appeals office of the irs we believe we have several meritorious defenses including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services therefore we believe that the subsequent resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors 

 

overview of our business 

 

we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry as measured by revenue we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 376 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we own or operate 223 transfer stations 192 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities we also operate 74 landfill gas and renewable energy projects we completed our merger with allied waste industries inc allied in december 2008 we believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 

 

despite the challenging economic environment our business performed well during 2009 due in large part to the indispensable nature of our services and the scalability of our business revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 1225 to 82 billion compared to 37 billion during the comparable period in 2008 this increase in revenue is attributable to our merger with allied assuming our merger with allied occurred on january 1 2008 and the revenue associated with the related divestitures is eliminated in the period the assets were sold along with the comparable prior year period core revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 would have decreased 107 consisting of a 30 increase in core price offset by decreases of 95 in core volume 25 in fuel charges and 17 in commodity price the core price increase together with cost control steps taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising costs and declining revenue resulting from decreases in service volumes 

 

2010 business initiatives 

 

we expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the latter part of 2008 and all of 2009 will extend into 2010 we anticipate continued yearoveryear decreases in volumes in all lines of our business however we believe that we will continue to benefit from our cost control and pricing initiatives our business is capital intensive slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy in addition our attention is focused on completing the integration of our newly merged company achieving cost synergies and pursuing other revenue enhancing and cost reduction opportunities 

our business initiatives for 2010 focus on completing the integration of our operations with allied’s while remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have made us successful our initiatives include 

 

  

recent developments 

 

in the first quarter of 2010 we notified the registered holders of our 6125 senior notes due 2014 the 6125 senior notes that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in march 2010 the 6125 senior notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 102042 of the principal amount of which 4250 million is outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest we expect to incur a charge upon extinguishment of the 6125 senior notes of approximately 52 million we expect this charge will be reflected in our first quarter 2010 financial results 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we notified the registered holders of our 7875 senior notes due 2013 our 4250 senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 and our 7375 senior notes due 2014 that we will redeem all of the notes outstanding in november and december of 2009 the 7875 senior notes due 2013 were redeemed at 102625 the 4250 senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 were redeemed at par and the 7375 senior notes due 2014 were redeemed at 103688 with respect to these redemptions as well as additional secondary market repurchases of our senior notes we incurred a fourth quarter loss on extinguishment of debt of 1023 million additionally in september 2009 we purchased and retired 3255 million of our outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a third quarter loss on extinguishment of debt of 318 million for the year ended december 31 2009 total loss on extinguishment of debt was 1341 million 

the repayment of the senior notes was primarily funded by the issuance of 6500 million of 5500 senior notes due 2019 and 6000 million of 5250 senior notes due 2021 in two separate private placement transactions the notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our parent company the notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our credit facilities these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors in addition we entered into a registration rights agreements with the representatives of the initial purchasers of the notes under the registration rights agreements we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us if we are unable to effect the exchange offer within 365 days we agreed to pay additional interest on the notes 

 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs

during each of the two years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we recorded a number of gains charges recoveries and other expenses that impacted our pretax income net income attributable to republic services inc net income  republic and diluted earnings per share these items primarily consist of the following in millions except per share data 

 

 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 we issued 12500 million of senior notes the proceeds of which were primarily used to purchase and retire outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 through 2034 additionally we repurchased certain of our outstanding senior notes in the secondary market 

restructuring charges during 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred 632 million and 827 million respectively of restructuring and integration charges related to our merger with allied these charges consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees substantially all of these charges were recorded in our “corporate entities” segment 

 

costs to achieve synergies during 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred 418 million and 29 million respectively of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plans these incremental costs primarily relate to a synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs in 2010 we expect that we will continue to accrue approximately 34 million for our synergy incentive plan 

 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net during 2009 we recorded gain loss on disposition of assets net of costs to sell of 1370 million related to the mandatory disposition of assets as required by doj as well as discretionary dispositions during 2008 we recorded asset impairments of 898 million primarily related to our countywide facility our former corporate office in florida and expected losses on sales of doj required divestitures 

 

remediation recoveries charges during 2009 we recovered 120 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at our countywide facility which were partially offset by additional charges of 52 million at our closed disposal facility in california remediation and related charges of 1568 million during 2008 were attributable to changes to our cost estimates at our countywide facility our closed disposal facility in california and the sunrise landfill in nevada 

 

tax effect of permanent items in adjustments during 2008 our effective tax rate was impacted by several expenses associated with the merger that were not tax deductible 

 

in addition we incurred the following charges for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

  

we believe that the presentation of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are not measures determined in accordance with us gaap provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items we use these measures and believe investors will find them helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods our definition of adjusted pretax income adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

these gains and charges affected our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 as follows in millions 

 

 

 

revenue 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal and recycling our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our transfer station landfill and to a lesser extent our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials other revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of recycled materials and revenue from national accounts acquired from allied national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations no one customer has individually accounted for more than 5 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the periods presented 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the respective years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

the following table summarizes our adjusted revenue for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 assuming our merger with allied occurred on january 1 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

adjusted revenue is used to calculate internal growth for the year ended december 31 2009 intercompany revenue relates to prior year transactions between republic and allied that would have been eliminated if the companies had merged on january 1 2008 

 

the following table reflects changes in our core adjusted revenue for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we have presented the components of our revenue changes for the year ended december 31 2009 assuming our merger with allied occurred on january 1 2008 

 

 

 

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation 

 

we believe that the preceding presentation of adjusted revenue and changes in adjusted revenue provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to understand increases or decreases in our revenue that are driven by changes in the operations of the newly combined company and not merely by the addition of allied’s revenues for periods after the merger this information has been prepared for illustrative purposes and is not intended to be indicative of the revenue that would have been realized had the merger been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented or the future results of the combined operations 

 

revenue – 2009 versus 2008 

 

revenue was 81991 million and 36851 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively an increase of 45140 million or 1225 this increase is due to the acquisition of allied in december 2008 

 

 42 

 

  

revenue – 2008 versus 2007 

 

revenue was 36851 million and 31762 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively an increase of 5089 million or 160 primarily due to the acquisition of allied in december 2008 

 

  

revenue – 2010 outlook 

 

we anticipate internal revenue from core operations to decrease approximately 05  20 during 2010 this decrease consists of expected growth in core pricing of approximately 20  25 offset by an expected decline in volume of approximately 30  40 our projections assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced at the end of 2009 however our internal growth may be more or less than expected in 2010 depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives 

 

cost of operations 

 

cost of operations was 48442 million 24167 million and 20039 million or as a percentage of revenue 591 656 and 631 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 versus the year ended december 31 2007 is a result of our acquisition of allied in december 2008 

 

cost of operations includes labor and related benefits which consists of salaries and wages health and welfare benefits incentive compensation and payroll taxes it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles equipment and containers including related labor and benefit costs transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles net of fuel credits disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes municipal franchise fees host community fees and royalties landfill operating costs which includes landfill accretion financial assurance leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs risk management which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

 

cost of operations – 2009 versus 2008 

 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue improved 65 to 591 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 656 for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the following 

 

  

cost of operations – 2008 versus 2007 

 

our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased 25 to 656 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 631 for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily as a result of the following

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment 

 

the following table summarizes depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 7991 million 3423 million and 2990 million or as a percentage of revenue 97 93 and 94 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to our acquisition of allied in december 2008 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment – 2009 versus 2008 

 

the increase in depreciation amortization and depletion expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in depreciation and depletion expense associated with equipment and landfills acquired from allied and recorded at their current fair values we allocated 26 billion of fair value to the landfills we acquired from allied the increase in the landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars is directly attributable to this allocation of fair value 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment – 2008 versus 2007 

 

the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred approximately 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 

 

amortization of intangible and other assets 

 

expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were 706 million 118 million and 65 million or as a percentage of revenue 09 03 and 02 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists franchise agreements municipal contracts trade names favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent noncompete agreements the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 versus 2007 is due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of allied 

 

accretion expense 

 

accretion expense was 888 million 239 million and 171 million or as a percentage of revenue 11 07 and 05 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in such 

expenses in aggregate dollars in 2009 and 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with our acquisition of allied the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of 975 which is higher than the creditadjusted riskfree rate we have used historically to record such obligations 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses were 8804 million 4347 million and 3137 million or as a percentage of revenue 107 118 and 99 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

selling general and administrative expenses include salaries health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management field support functions sales force accounting and finance legal management information systems and clerical and administrative departments other expenses include rent and office costs fees for professional services provided by third parties marketing investor and community relations directors’ and officers’ insurance general employee relocation travel entertainment and bank charges but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges 

 

the following table provides the components of our selling general and administrative costs for the three years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our selling general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies 

 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2009 versus 2008 

 

selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 include 416 million of costs to achieve synergies related to the allied merger these costs primarily consist of a synergy related bonus of approximately 34 million accrued in 2009 we expect to incur an additional 340 million of expense during 2010 to fully accrue for the synergy related bonus 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 142 million of bad debt expense related to conforming allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and 54 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures we also recorded 243 million of settlement charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters and a charge of 29 million related to the synergy related bonus 

 

excluding charges for synergies conforming accounting policies bankruptcies and certain legal matters selling general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 would have been 8388 million and 3879 million or 102 and 105 as a percentage of revenue respectively upon the completion of the integration of allied our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative costs at no more than 100 of revenue which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 

 

selling general and administrative expenses – 2008 versus 2007 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses excluding the costs mentioned above in aggregate dollars during 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to our merger with allied the increase in such 

expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus 2007 is primarily due to our merger with allied and a 43 million reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts which we recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience 

 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net 

 

gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments net of costs to sell was 1370 million and 898 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and nil for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we divested of certain assets as required by the doj as a condition of the merger with allied and recorded a gain of 1535 million offsetting this gain was a loss of 102 million recognized in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in miamidade county florida as well as 71 million of additional asset impairments primarily related to our former corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a charge of 759 million related to the impairment of our countywide facility this impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa based upon recent negotiations with the oepa and the epa also during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 78 million of other impairment charges consisting primarily of charges related to our former corporate office in south florida 

 

restructuring charges 

 

as a result of our acquisition of allied we committed to a restructuring plan related to our corporate overhead and other administrative and operating functions the plan included closing our corporate office in florida consolidating administrative functions to arizona the former headquarters of allied and reducing staffing levels the plan also included closing and consolidating certain operating locations and terminating certain leases during the year ended december 31 2009 we incurred 632 million of restructuring and integration charges related to our integration of allied of which 340 million consists of charges for severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits the remainder of the charges primarily related to consulting and professional fees substantially all the charges are recorded in our corporate segment during 2010 we expect to incur additional charges approximating 12 million to complete our plan we expect that the majority of these charges will be paid during 2010 and will extend into 2011 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense was 5959 million 1319 million and 948 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the following table provides the components of interest expense including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and selffunded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the acquisition of allied 

 

 

 

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 versus 2008 is primarily due to the additional debt we assumed as a result of our acquisition of allied interest expense also increased as a result of accreting discounts applied to debt or imputing interest on environmental and risk reserves assumed from allied 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt was 1341 million for the year ended december 31 2009 resulting from the following 

 

  

the loss on extinguishment of debt recorded during 2009 consists of premiums paid to repurchase debt the charge for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase in the future we may chose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired 

 

interest income and other income expense net 

 

interest income and other income net of other expense was 52 million 80 million and 269 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

income taxes 

 

our provision for income taxes was 3685 million 854 million and 1779 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective income tax rate was 426 536 and 380 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective income tax rate is adversely impacted by expenses incurred which are nondeductible for tax disposition of assets that have little or no basis for tax and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 

 

in the future we may choose to divest certain operating assets that have little or no tax basis thereby resulting in a higher taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized the higher taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in which the divestiture is consummated 

 

with respect to the settlement of certain tax liabilities regarding our risk management companies we paid approximately 58 million in the first quarter of 2010 and anticipate paying the remainder approximately 67 million later in 2010 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the merger with allied in addition lower pretax earnings contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 48 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 

 

reportable segments 

 

our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended 

december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

corporate entities include legal tax treasury information technology risk management human resources corporate accounts and other typical administrative functions national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas and as such the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators consequently substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs which are recorded in cost of operations 

 

we completed the reorganization of our operating segments related to our acquisition of allied in the first quarter of 2009 and are providing internal and external reporting in accordance with our reorganized structure significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing 2009 with 2008 and comparing 2008 with 2007 are discussed in the following paragraphs the increase in aggregate dollars for revenue depreciation amortization depletion and accretion and operating income loss for each of our reportable segments is due to our acquisition of allied the results of our reportable segments were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and liabilities as required by the doj where the effect was significant we have noted our operating margin exclusive of these gains and losses additionally the decrease in revenue resulting from declines in volumes and commodity prices noted below are attributable to the economic slowdown 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

 

 49 

  

in 2009 we realized a 40 million net gain from the disposition of assets which increased operating margins by 02 we also recovered 120 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at our countywide facility in ohio which increased operating margins by 06 

 

in 2008 we incurred a 999 million charge for environmental conditions at our countywide facility which reduced our operating margin for the year ended december 31 2008 by 101 we incurred a 759 million charge related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon negotiations with the oepa and epa which reduced our operating margin by 77 we also incurred 110 million in legal settlement costs which decreased operating margins by 11 

 

the remaining increase in operating margins is attributed to lower fuel disposal and selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher labor and facilities expense 

 

  

in 2009 we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of 271 million which increased operating margins by 15 otherwise the improvement in operating margin for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily due to lower transportation fuel and selling general and administrative expenses the increase in operating margin was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 we realized net gains from the disposition of assets of 298 million which impacted operating margins by 15 we also realized in 2009 an 88 million favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations which increased our operating margin by 04 otherwise the improvement in operating margin for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily due to lower disposal transport and fuel costs partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 we realized gains from the disposition of assets of 881 million which increased operating margins by 41 partially offsetting these gains was an unfavorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of 64 million reducing operating margin by 03 and remediation charges totaling 52 million reducing operating margin by 03 related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california in addition lower landfill revenue which has higher margins than our collection line of business negatively impacted 2009 margins 

 

in the second quarter of 2008 we incurred a 340 million charge at the sunrise landfill and a 219 million charge at our closed disposal facility in california for environmental conditions at each of these locations the charges reduced operating margin by 59 margins were favorably impacted by lower labor fuel transportation and selling general and administrative expenses offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from assets acquired from allied and higher facilities expense 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

 

  

the operating loss in 2008 includes remediation charges of 999 million related to estimated costs to comply with the fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa related to our countywide facility and an impairment charge of 759 million related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon negotiations with the oepa and epa it also includes 110 million of settlement costs for certain legal matters 

 

operating income for 2007 includes a 446 million charge to operating expenses associated with environmental conditions at countywide 

 

  

operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to an adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations during 2007 and due to higher fuel costs 

 

  

operating margins increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher revenue lower disposal costs and lower insurance costs partially offset by higher fuel costs 

 

  

operating income in 2008 includes a 340 million charge related to estimated costs to comply with a consent decree and settlement agreement signed with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill it also includes a 219 million charge recorded during 2008 associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california 

 

operating income in 2007 includes an 81 million increase in landfill operating costs and a 52 million increase in amortization expense for asset retirement obligations associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in california 

 

 51 

  

landfill and environmental matters 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

 

as of december 31 2009 we owned or operated 192 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 46 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2009 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 44 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 02 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information during 2009 total available airspace decreased by a net 2969 million cubic yards primarily due to divestitures closures and airspace consumed partially offset by new expansions 

 

during 2008 total available airspace increased by a net 32 billion cubic yards due to the merger with allied in december which contributed 157 active landfills representing 33 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace excluding the merger with allied total available airspace related to republic’s premerger operations decreased by a net 01 billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates and changes in design the decrease during 2008 due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at our countywide facility 

during 2007 total available airspace increased by a net 75 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken changes in engineering estimates and permits granted partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design in addition total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 

 

at december 31 2006 72 of our total available airspace or 1246 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills at december 31 2009 46 of our total available airspace or 2125 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills between december 31 2006 and december 31 2009 we received permits for twelve of our probable expansions which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

as of december 31 2009 twelve of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity eight of which were added as a result of our acquisition of allied at projected annual volumes these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 39 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 46 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of december 31 2009 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10745 million of which 1375 million is current and 9370 million is longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

 

in december 2009 we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the acquisition of allied these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied or a predecessor company that it had acquired had been identified as a potentially responsible party the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring see also note 2 summary of significant accounting policies — environmental remediation liabilities for further information we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 975 discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid 

the following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters 

 

countywide landfill in 2007 we were issued final findings and orders fos by the ohio environmental protection agency oepa related to environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide in east sparta ohio and we agreed to undertake certain other remedial actions with the oepa as well during 2008 republic services of ohio ii llc republicohio an ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of countywide entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republicohio to perform certain remediation activities at countywide republicohio also has completed construction of an isolation break under the authority and supervision of the us epa on september 30 2009 republicohio entered into a set of fos with the oepa that supersede previous fos mentioned above the fos require the implementation of a comprehensive operation and maintenance program for managing the remediation area the operation and maintenance program requires republicohio to maintain the temporary cap and other engineering controls to prevent odors and isolate and contain the reaction the operation and maintenance program also requires the installation of a composite cap in the remediation area when conditions become conducive to such installation and is ultimately designed to result in the final capping and closure of the 88acre remediation area at countywide the remediation liability for countywide recorded as of december 31 2009 is 742 million of which approximately 57 million is expected to be paid during 2010 

 

west contra costa county landfill in 2006 we were issued an enforcement order by the california department of toxic substance control dtsc for the class 1 hazardous waste cell at the west contra costa county landfill west county subsequently we entered into a consent agreement with dtsc in 2007 at which time we agreed to undertake certain remedial actions the remediation liability for west county recorded as of december 31 2009 is 468 million of which approximately 16 million is expected to be paid during 2010 

 

sunrise landfill on august 1 2008 republic services of southern nevada rssn our wholly owned subsidiary signed a consent decree with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill under the consent decree rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county were otherwise jointly and severally liable rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree however we have not recorded any potential recoveries the remediation liability for sunrise recorded as of december 31 2009 is 370 million of which approximately 128 million is expected to be paid during 2010 

 

congress development landfill in january 2006 congress development co cdc was issued an agreed preliminary injunction and order by the circuit court of illinois cook county subsequently the court issued two additional supplemental orders that required cdc to implement certain remedial actions at the congress landfill the remediation liability recorded for cdc as of december 31 2009 is 825 million of which approximately 199 million is expected to be paid during 2010 

 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

the increase in the investment in our landfills both in aggregate dollars and as an investment per cubic yard is primarily due to the acquisition of allied in december 2008 landfill development cost in the above table includes 26 billion of purchase price for the acquisition that has been allocated to the permitted and probable expansion airspace acquired based on its fair value as of the date of the acquisition depletion amortization and accretion expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to accretion expense associated with capping closure and postclosure liabilities assumed from allied the asset retirement obligations assumed from allied are recorded using a discount rate of 975 which is higher than the rate we have historically used see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies regarding asset retirement obligation adjustments 

 

during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 our weightedaverage compaction rate was approximately 1700 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

 

as of december 31 2009 we expect to spend an estimated additional 60 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 92 billion or 198 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method

changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures changes in assets and liabilities negatively affected our cash flow from operations by 2519 million in 2009 versus a negative impact of 789 million in 2008 primarily as a result of the following 

 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 5122 million and 6613 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments made for accounts payable and federal income taxes

change in restricted cash and marketable securities changes in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances which are largely related to the issuance of taxexempt bonds for our capital needs and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance contributed 416 million to our investing activities in 2009 compared to uses of cash of 53 million and 116 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the funds received from issuances of taxexempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance as we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets proceeds from bond issuances represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows during 2009 our reimbursements from restricted cash accounts exceeded funds received from the issuance of taxexempt bonds

fees and expenses in connection therewith and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger 

 

premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior notes in connection with the issuance of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in 2009 we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling 616 million

financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had 480 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2405 million of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities including 931 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 

 

in april 2007 we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility from 7500 million to 10 billion and extended the term from 2010 to 2012 in conjunction with the merger with allied in september 2008 we entered into an additional 175 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks this credit facility was used initially at the time of the merger to refinance extensions of credit under allied’s senior credit facility to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger we also amended our existing 10 billion credit facility to conform certain terms of the facility to those included in our new 175 billion credit facility we did not change the maturity date of the 10 billion credit facility 

 

the 10 billion revolving credit facility due april 2012 and the 175 billion revolving credit facility due september 2013 collectively credit facilities bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings all as defined in the agreements as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the interest rate for our borrowings under our credit facilities was 182 and 343 respectively our credit facilities are also subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments regardless of usage borrowings under our credit facilities can be used for working capital capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes we had 03 billion and 06 billion of eurodollar rate borrowings and 16 billion and 17 billion of letters of credit utilizing availability under our credit facilities leaving 08 billion and 04 billion of availability under our credit facilities at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

the agreements governing the credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants we have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity at december 31 2009 our ebitda to interest ratio was 401 compared to the 300 minimum required by the covenants in addition at december 31 2009 our total debt to ebitda ratio was 287 compared to the 400 maximum allowed by the covenants at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and during 2010 we expect to be in compliance 

ebitda which is a nongaap measure is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements in this context ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes 

 

in december 2009 we used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our credit facilities to redeem 4000 million of our 7375 senior notes due 2014 the senior notes were redeemed at a price equal to 103688 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest we incurred a charge of 460 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt the charge for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase 

 

in november 2009 we issued 6000 million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 5250 due 2021 in a private placement transaction the notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on november 15 2021 interest is payable semiannually on may 15 and november 15 beginning may 15 2010 these senior notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our credit facilities these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors in addition we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes under the registration rights agreement we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us if we are unable to effect the exchange offer within 365 days we agreed to pay additional interest on the notes we used the net proceeds from the notes cash on hand or incremental borrowings under our credit facilities as follows i to redeem 4500 million of our 7875 senior notes due 2013 at 102625 and ii to redeem 2300 million of our 4250 senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2034 at par we incurred a loss of 519 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase 

 

in september 2009 we issued 6500 million of 5500 senior notes due 2019 with an unamortized discount of 45 million at december 31 2009 the notes are general senior unsecured obligations and mature on september 15 2019 interest is payable semiannually on march 15 and september 15 beginning march 15 2010 the notes are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that also guarantee our credit facilities these guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of subsidiary guarantors in addition we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes under the registration rights agreement we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement to exchange the notes for freely tradable notes issued by us if we are unable to effect the exchange offer within 365 days we agreed to pay additional interest on the notes we used the net proceeds from the notes cash on hand or incremental borrowings under our credit facilities as follows i 3255 million to tender for certain outstanding senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 that were issued by us or one of our subsidiaries ii approximately 250 million to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and iii approximately 105 million to remit estimated tax payments related to our divestiture of assets in connection with our merger with allied we incurred a loss of 318 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase 

 

during 2009 we repurchased a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2010 and 2011 in the secondary market and as a result we incurred additional losses on extinguishment of debt of 44 million related to premiums paid to repurchase debt charges for unamortized debt discounts and professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase also during 2009 we completed the required divestitures under the consent decree with the doj proceeds from the sales of the divested assets were primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities additionally our senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7125 matured during 2009 we repaid the remaining principal balance of 993 million in may 2009 

 

in the first quarter of 2010 we called 4250 million of our 6125 senior notes due 2014 we expect to incur a loss upon extinguishment of the debt of approximately 52 million 

 

we have an accounts receivable securitization program with two financial institutions that allows us to borrow up to 3000 million on a revolving basis under loan agreements secured by receivables as of december 31 2009 receivables secured loans totaled 3000 million in may 2009 we renewed the facility for 364 days and reduced the borrowing capacity from 4000 million to 3000 million we expect to repay the facility from 

free cash flow draws on our credit facilities or proceeds from other note offerings on or before the may 2010 maturity 

 

in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 2100 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 675 our swap agreements mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2009 we had 12237 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 020 to 825 at december 31 2009 and have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037 as of december 31 2009 we had 931 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

 

we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to repay debt which may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 

 

in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity date using cash from operations or additional borrowings we may also explore opportunities in capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable the early extinguishment of debt may result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repurchased and retired the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs 

 

credit rating 

 

we have received investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2009 our senior debt was rated bbb baa3 and bbb by standard  poor’s rating services inc moody’s investors service inc and fitch inc respectively 

 

fuel hedges 

 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices we have entered into multiple swap agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the swaps qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges 

 

we have the following fuel hedges outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price as published by the department of energy exceeds the contract price per gallon we receive the difference between the average 

price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counterparty if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from thirdparty counterparties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy the aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at december 31 2009 and 2008 were current assets of 32 million and 12 million respectively and accrued liabilities of 49 million and 129 million respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2009 and 2008 net of tax of 10 million and 71 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income realized losses gains of 73 million 59 million and 16 million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

commodity hedges 

 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to certain forecasted commodity sales the swaps qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales commodity hedges 

 

we have the following commodity hedges outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

if the price per short ton of the hedging instrument average price as reported on the official board market is less than the contract price per short ton we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional short tons from the counterparty if the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from thirdparty counterparties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy the aggregated fair values of the outstanding commodity hedges at december 31 2009 and 2008 were current assets of 18 million and 88 million respectively and current liabilities of 08 million and nil respectively and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 

the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2009 and 2008 net of tax of 06 million and 53 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other 

comprehensive income the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 in millions 

 

 

 

the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2009 

 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments host agreements and takeorpay and putorpay agreements and ii other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 

 

in addition to the above we have unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 of 2422 million of which we expect to settle approximately 10 million to 20 million within the next twelve months due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 

 

we also have letters of credit of 17 billion of which 16 billion utilize availability under our credit facilities at december 31 2009 

 

debt covenants 

 

our credit facilities contain financial covenants we have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants of the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2009 we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2010 

 

on december 10 2008 we received the requisite consents for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt securities of allied waste north america inc awna the amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing reporting obligations required of allied under the amended supplemental indentures the ongoing reporting obligations may be satisfied by republic 

 

the collateral that had secured the awna senior notes and the bfi debentures equally and ratably with the allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of the merger with allied and the repayment of that facility 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

financial assurance 

 

we are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies or trust deposits the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states will require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 

 

additionally we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2010 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere herein 

 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is as follows in millions 

 

 

 

the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

contingencies 

 

for a description of our contingencies see note 10 income taxes and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

 

accounting for the acquisition of allied 

 

acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition with the 

excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 

 

we have completed valuing all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of allied adjustments if any to our estimates of fair values and the resulting purchase price allocation in future periods will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment other intangible assets landfill asset retirement obligations legal and environmental reserves selfinsurance reserves income taxes other noncurrent assets and longterm obligations and assets held for sale our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december 31 2009 a portion of which will be paid in future periods 

 

residual risks 

 

the residual risks identified below related to critical accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair value estimation processes for acquisitions for discussion of other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for acquisitions see item 1a risk factors  

 

landfill accounting 

 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 

 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 

  

landfill development costs 

 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

 

site permits in order to develop construct and operate a landfill we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

 

residual risks

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed such as the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

 

residual risk 

 

 69 

 

landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

 

residual risk 

 

  

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

 

obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 

 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

 

the initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time during 2009 we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding our remediation sites and as a result increased the fair value of our closure and postclosure reserves by 723 million any further adjustments to our reserves 

resulting in changes in estimate or settlements will be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the periods in which such adjustments become known 

 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually 25 in both 2009 and 2008 

 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 75 in 2009 and 66 in 2008 

 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion expense is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

  

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

 

in connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations we made a change in estimate which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle this change which we believe is preferable was made to better 

align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event this change resulted in a 326 million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

permitted and probable disposal capacity as described previously disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows 

 

  

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

 

residual risk 

 

  

environmental liabilities 

 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 

in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

 

the environmental liabilities assumed from allied relate to impacts at both owned and unowned sites in the case of owned sites we are actively working with the appropriate regulatory entity under the applicable regulations typically rcra or cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues at unowned sites we are working within the regulatory and procedural framework established by cercla to characterize and remediate potential issues in conjunction with other potentially liable parties at each location pursuant to the purchase method of accounting we have recorded the environmental remediation liabilities assumed from allied based upon estimates of their fair value using an estimate of future cash flows or settlement previously and consistent with our method of accounting allied recorded remediation liabilities based upon accounting for loss contingencies however amounts recorded under this method are generally not at fair value 

 

since the date of acquisition our process for deriving fair value for the environmental liabilities assumed from allied included first identifying the population of remediation sites where we are either fully or partially responsible for remediation or potential remediation the population of remediation sites was then stratified into categories based on i the maturity of the issue relative to recognized stages in the applicable regulation typically cercla or rcra and ii the extent of our participation in the remediation activity using these categories we applied one of the following multiple estimation processes to quantify fair value 

 

  

the initial liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of allied were recorded using provisional amounts based upon information available at that time during 2009 we gathered and assessed new information obtained about the facts and circumstances surrounding allied’s remediation sites in certain situations we used external engineers and attorneys to assist in the development of our fair value estimates as a result of the process we increased the fair value of our remediation reserves by 1819 million any further adjustments to our remediation reserves resulting from changes in estimates or reserve settlements will be reflected currently in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known

selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured accruals for selfinsurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverage ranging from 10 million to 30 million 

 

residual risks 

 

  

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 

 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

 

residual risks 

 

  

asset impairment 

 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

 

residual risk 

 

 74 

 

evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

 

residual risk 

 

  

recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

 

goodwill recoverability 

 

we annually test goodwill at december 31 for impairment using the twostep process the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the impairment if any the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

 

we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments eastern midwest southern and western in determining fair value we primarily utilize discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 

 

significant estimates used in our fair value calculation utilizing discounted future cash flows include but are not limited to i estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit which we estimate to range from 3 to 5 ii future estimated effective tax rates which we estimate to be 40 iii future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital iv estimated discount rates which we estimate to range between 8 and 10 and v the future terminal value of the reporting unit which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity significant estimates used in the fair value calculation utilizing market value multiples include but are not limited to i estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit ii estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay and iii estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 

 

in addition we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances include i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator iii a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold iv continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit v a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value or vi the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 

 

we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate reporting segment to our four operating segments to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit’s fair value 

 

in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31 2009 we determined that the aggregate sum of our reporting unit fair values exceeded our market capitalization we determined market capitalization as the fair value of our common shares outstanding at the closing market price on december 31 2009 we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between fair value and our market capitalization is due to a 

control premium we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and  or synergies by obtaining control and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 

 

as of december 31 2009 we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units by a range of 125 to 150 and as such we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 

 

we will continuously monitor market trends in our business the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill additionally we would then be required to review our remaining longlived assets for impairment 

 

our operating segments which also represent our reporting units are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 

 

residual risks 

 

  

income taxes 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted new guidance which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements this new guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits this new guidance also provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties and accounting in interim periods 

 

we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

residual risks 

 

  

defined benefit pension plans 

 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and irc as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are required for 2010 

 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee at december 31 2009 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash we annually review and adjust the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary 

 

residual risk 

 

  

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

 

we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate increases by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 315 million if 

the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 366 million 

 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and accordingly approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” 

 

 

 

the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude noncash discounts premiums adjustments to fair value related to hedging transactions and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling 4675 million 

 

fuel price risk 

 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new or renewal contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 

1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

 

at our current consumption levels a onecent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 15 million on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

 

our operations also require the use of certain petrochemicalbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

commodities prices 

 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities as a result changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in 2009 2008 and 2007 were approximately 1812 million 1211 million and 1139 million respectively

report of management on republic services inc’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

we as members of management of republic services inc are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

we under the supervision of and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the specified criteria 

 

our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their attestation report which is included herein 

 

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

overview 

 

as of december 31 2008 we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 400 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we also own or operate 242 transfer stations 213 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 520 billion of which approximately 58 is generated by publicly owned waste companies for 2008 and after giving effect to the merger described below we and one other company generated a significant percentage of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue additionally industry data indicates that the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 16 and 26 respectively of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new households and business formation and is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction activity 

 

on december 5 2008 we completed our merger with allied on the effective date of the merger each share of allied common stock outstanding was converted into 45 shares of our common stock we issued approximately 1958 million shares of common stock to allied stockholders in the transaction as a condition to the merger we agreed to divest of certain assets as required by the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj under the hartscottrodino antitrust act hsr act in february 2009 we announced an agreement to sell waste connections inc the majority of the assets we are required to divest the assets being divested include six municipal solid waste landfills six collection operations and three transfer stations across seven markets this transaction is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence regulatory approval and other customary matters closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2009 however the timing and proceeds received from the divestiture to waste connections and the divestiture of the remaining assets as required by the doj cannot be predicted in addition the merger is expected to generate total annual runrate integration synergies primarily resulting from operating efficiencies economies of scale and leveraging corporate and overhead resources of approximately 1500 million by the end of 2010 we have identified and are on track to realize in 2009 approximately 1000 million or 67 of the total expected annual runrate synergies our financial results for 2008 include allied’s operating results from the date of the merger and have not been retroactively restated to include allied’s historical financial position or results of operations 

 

our operations are national in scope but the physical collection and disposal of waste is very much a local business therefore the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of our markets by combining local operating management with standardized business practices we can drive greater overall operating efficiency across the company while maintaining daytoday operating decisions at the local level closest to the customer we facilitate the implementation of this strategy through an organizational structure that groups our operations within a corporate region and area structure we manage our operations through four geographic operating segments which are also our reportable segments eastern central southern and western due to the timing of our acquisition of allied management reviewed and we have presented allied as a separate operating segment in our consolidated financial statements additionally during the first quarter of 2008 we realigned our reporting segments and consolidated our previous southwestern 

operations into our western operations the boundaries of our operating segments may change from time to time each of our regions is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe this structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy and allows us to maximize the growth opportunities in each of our markets and to operate the business efficiently while maintaining effective controls and standards over operational and administrative matters including financial reporting see note 14 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our operating segments 

 

we had revenue of 37 billion and 32 billion and operating income of 2832 million and 5360 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition to our merger with allied there were a number of items that impacted our 2008 financial results for a description of these items see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview of our business and consolidated results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

our presence in markets with growing populations throughout the sunbelt including california arizona and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions us to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below 

 

financial strategy 

 

key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade ratings and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 

 

furthermore we expect to generate total annual runrate integration synergies in connection with the merger with allied of approximately 1500 million by the end of 2010 primarily by achieving greater operating efficiencies capturing inherent economies of scale and leveraging corporate and overhead resources we have identified and are on track to realize 1000 million of annual runrate integration benefits by the end of 2009 we are confident that we will be able to realize the balance of the targeted 1500 million in synergies in the second year following the merger despite the economic slowdown consequently we have developed and implemented incentive programs that help focus our entire company on the realization of key financial metrics of increasing free cash flow achieving targeted earnings maintaining and improving returns on invested capital as well as achieving integration synergies 

 

the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following 

 

  

price growth growth through price increases helps ensure that we obtain an adequate return on our substantial capital investment and the business risk associated with such investment price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs which ultimately enhances our operating margins 

 

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business we work to increase collection and disposal volumes while insuring that prices charged for such services provide an appropriate return on our capital investment 

 

  

for certain risks related to our financial strategy see item 1a risk factors  

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following 

 

  

  

james e o’connor who has served as our chief executive officer ceo since december 1998 also became our chairman in january 2003 he worked at waste management inc from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr o’connor has 34 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

donald w slager became our president  chief operating officer coo upon our merging with allied in december 2008 prior to the merger mr slager worked for allied from 1992 through 2008 and served in various management positions including president  coo from 2004 through 2008 and executive vice president and coo from 2003 to 2004 from 2001 to 2003 mr slager served as senior vice president operations he held various management positions at allied from 1992 to 2003 and was previously general manager at national waste services where he served in various management positions since 1985 mr slager has over 23 years of experience in the solid waste industry

growth strategy 

 

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions we manage our growth strategy as follows 

 

  

pricing activities we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs to improve our operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills during 2008 we continued to secure broadbased price increases across all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital and operating costs price increases will remain a major component of our overall future operating strategy 

 

longterm contracts we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste in markets with growing populations these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets we believe it is important to have secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in market areas in some of the fastest growing states according to the us census bureau for example arizona texas and california we believe that this positions us to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate in addition we believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growing population markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 

 

sales and marketing activities we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable us to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate we provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of our national clients centralizing services to effectively manage their needs such as minimizing their procurement costs we currently have approximately 1200 sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial industrial municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in addition we utilize a customer relationship management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts 

 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

 

 7 

  

  

we also seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

on december 5 2008 we completed our merger with allied we expect to achieve total annual runrate integration synergies primarily relating to operating efficiencies inherent economies of scale and leveraging corporate and overhead resources of approximately 1500 million by the end of 2010 we have identified and are on track to realize in 2009 approximately 1000 million or 67 of the total expected annual runrate synergies 

 

for certain risks related to our growth strategy see item 1a risk factors 

 

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

 

  

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with us the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by considerations such as market factors collection frequency type of equipment furnished the type and volume or weight of the waste collected the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal 

 

we also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

we also provide recycling services in certain markets in compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

  

as of december 31 2008 we owned or operated 213 active landfills which had approximately 36900 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 49 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils 

 

most of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however no assurances can be made that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

we also have responsibility for 126 closed landfills for which we have associated closure and postclosure liabilities 

 

  

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable us to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable us to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 1200 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

 

most of our marketing activity is local in nature however we also provide a national accounts program in response to the needs of some of our national and regional customers our national accounts program is designed to provide the best total solution to our customers’ evolving waste management needs in an environmentally responsible manner we partner with our national clients to reach their sustainability goals optimize waste streams balance equipment and service intervals and provide customized reporting the national accounts program centralizes services to effectively manage customer needs while helping minimize procurement costs with our extended geographic reach our national program 

effectively serves 40 states and puerto rico as industry leaders our mission is to utilize our strengths and expertise to exceed customer expectations by consistently delivering the best national program available 

 

we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publicly owned companies including waste management inc waste several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies and thousands of small privately owned companies in any given market competitors may have larger operations and greater resources in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency epa and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work 

and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations 

 

  

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to submit to the epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 

 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

  

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so in addition the epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

liability under cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous waste it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of thousands of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such 

substances thus even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous waste as such it is possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or “released” at landfills or other properties owned by third parties where we have transported to and disposed of waste or at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

  

state and local regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations some counties municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the epa respectively 

in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these permits and approvals may be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for us to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak we could be liable for response costs and if the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states and local government authorities have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdiction lines in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional in 2007 the supreme court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned waste facility a number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries other governments may enact similar regulations in the future these regulations may in some cases cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal thereby adversely affecting our operations 

 

we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because 

of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 35000 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements from time to time our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts we have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages we currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 

 

compensation 

 

we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with our overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based on free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these goals agree with our overall goals incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our overall goals furthermore in conjunction with the merger with allied we have developed integration metrics to be achieved by our executive management team and key employees based upon targeted annual runrate synergies of approximately 1500 million by the end of 2010 in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our short and longterm goals and helps ensure that our longterm success is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

we may experience difficulties integrating allied’s business 

 

achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger with allied will depend significantly on whether we can integrate allied’s business in an efficient and effective manner although republic and allied were able to conduct some planning regarding the integration of the two companies prior to the merger we might not have determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the merger the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized we may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly successfully or on a timely basis the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations information systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration we and allied operate numerous systems and controls including those 

involving information management purchasing accounting and finance sales billing employee benefits payroll and regulatory compliance the integration of operations following the merger will require the dedication of significant management and external resources which may temporarily distract management’s attention from our daytoday business and be costly employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business the inability of our management to successfully and timely integrate the operations of republic and allied could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company 

 

we may not realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits from the merger with allied fully or within the timing anticipated 

 

we entered into the merger agreement with allied because we believe that the merger will be beneficial to our stockholders primarily as a result of the anticipated synergies resulting from the combined operations we may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or the longterm strategic benefits of the merger fully or within the timing anticipated for example elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated for at least the first year after an acquisition and possibly longer the benefits from the acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations the inability to realize the full extent of or any of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of the merger or our encountering delays in the integration process which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

future expenses resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the merger 

 

in accordance with gaap we are considered the acquirer of allied for accounting purposes we have accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting there may be future expenses related to the acquisition that are required to be recorded in our earnings that could adversely affect the market value of our common stock following the completion of the merger under the purchase method of accounting we have allocated the total purchase price to the assets including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired from allied based on their fair values as of the effective date of the merger and we have recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill for certain tangible and intangible assets and for our capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations revaluing them to their fair values as of the merger completion date will result in additional depreciation depletion and amortization and accretion expense that will exceed the combined amounts recorded by republic and allied prior to the merger interest expense will increase significantly as a result of revaluing allied’s debt and other longterm liabilities including for example selfinsurance reserves and environmental liabilities in addition as discussed in the following risk factor to the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible assets were to become impaired after the merger we may incur material noncash charges to our results of operations 

 

our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired which could result in material noncash charges to our results of operations 

 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the merger with allied at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by gaap we evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair values of each of our operating segments the estimated fair value of our operating segments could change if there are changes in our capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization or in general economic conditions impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations 

we may incur significant unexpected transaction and integrationrelated costs in connection with the merger 

 

we have incurred and may continue to incur costs associated with combining the operations of republic and allied including charges and payments to some employees pursuant to “change in control” contractual obligations the substantial majority of these expenses resulting from the merger are comprised of transaction costs related to the merger facilities and systems consolidation costs and employeerelated costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses or may result from the application of purchase accounting used to effectuate the merger the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may not offset incremental transaction and other integrationrelated costs in the near term 

 

the timing of and proceeds received from the mandatory divestiture of certain assets of the company may result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the benefit of the merger 

 

completion of the merger is predicated on divesting of certain assets as required by the antitrust division of the doj under the hsr act in february 2009 we announced an agreement with waste connections inc to sell them a majority of the assets we are required to divest the assets being divested to waste connections include six municipal solid waste landfills six collection operations and three transfer stations across seven markets this transaction is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence regulatory approval and other customary matters closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2009 however the timing of and proceeds we will receive from the divestiture to waste connections and the divestiture of the remaining assets as required by the doj cannot be predicted delays in divesting of these assets may result in additional expenditures of money and resources which would reduce the financial benefit we expect from the merger in addition the amount of proceeds received from such divestitures cannot be guaranteed an unanticipated shortfall in proceeds may limit our ability to execute our financial strategy including repaying our debt 

 

we have substantial indebtedness as a result of the merger which may limit our financial flexibility 

 

as of december 31 2008 we have approximately 77 billion in total debt outstanding this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our debt instruments further our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures reducing dividends selling assets restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity capital 

 

the downturn in the us economy may have an adverse impact on our operating results 

 

a weak economy generally results in decreases in the volumes of waste generated in the past weakness in the us economy has had a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing and construction industries and our proceeds from sales of recycled commodities as a result of the global economic crisis we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover as well there can be no assurance that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows further there can be no assurance that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate if at all positive improvement in our results of operations or cash flows 

the downturn in the us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies large national accounts and others 

 

the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies we provide services to a number of these agencies including numerous municipalities these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us in addition the weak economy may cause other customers including our large national accounts to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the downturn in the us economy and in the financial markets could expose us to counterparty risk associated with our derivatives 

 

to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in various commodities and interest rates we have entered into a number of derivative agreements these derivative agreements require us or the counterparty to such agreements to make payments to the other party if the price of certain commodities or interest rates exceed a specified amount a continued downturn in the us economy or in the financial markets could adversely impact the financial stability of the counterparties with which we do business potentially limiting their ability to fulfill their obligations under our derivative agreements this could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources flexibility to reduce prices and other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 

 

we principally compete with large national waste management companies municipalities and numerous regional and local companies for collection and disposal accounts competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services competition for landfill business is primarily based on disposal costs geographic location and quality of operations some of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than us many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or taxexempt financing our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may also be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time or in certain markets if we were to lower prices to address these competitive issues it could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability 

 

price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services in addition we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs including fuel costs to improve operating margins and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share contractual general economic or marketspecific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices as a result of these factors we may be unable to offset increases in costs improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases we may also lose volume to lowercost competitors 

 

increases in the cost of fuel or oil will increase our operating expenses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fuel or oil cost increases from our customers 

 

our operations are dependent on fuel to run our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection transfer and disposal we buy fuel in the open market fuel prices are unpredictable and can 

fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control including geopolitical developments actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers supply and demand for oil and gas war terrorism and unrest in oilproducing countries and regional production patterns we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel surcharges for example our fuel costs were 2353 million in 2008 representing 97 of our cost of operations compared to 1803 million in 2007 representing 90 of our cost of operations this increase primarily reflects an increase in the price of fuel 

 

in addition regulations affecting the type of fuel our trucks use are changing and could materially increase the cost and consumption of our fuel our operations also require the use of certain petroleumbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of oil an increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our revenue operating income and cash flows 

 

we process recyclable materials such as paper cardboard plastics aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials the resale and purchase prices of and market demand for recyclable materials can be volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control these fluctuations may affect our future revenue operating income and cash flows 

 

adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 

 

our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation may interfere with collection and landfill operations delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers in addition weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 

 

we currently have matters pending with the doj and internal revenue service irs which could result in large cash expenditures and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 

 

as a result of the merger with allied we are currently under examination by the irs with regard to allied’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 through 2006 

 

an allied subsidiary browningferris industries llc bfi fka browningferris industries inc currently has a tax matter in litigation for the tax years ended september 30 1997 through july 30 1999 related to a capital loss deduction a portion of this loss was subsequently carried forward to allied’s 1999 through 2002 tax years we are currently engaged in two refund suits related to this matter the bfi tax years september 30 1997 through july 30 1999 are currently before the us court of federal claims while the allied tax year ended december 31 1999 is currently before the us district court of arizona all future tax years impacted by the bfi capital loss deduction and subsequent carryforward by allied are presently in various stages of the irs examination or appeals process any resolution or final determination on the merits for an earlier tax year will also resolve the issue for all subsequent periods 

 

during its examination of allied’s 2002 tax year the irs asserted that a 2002 redemption of four partnership interests in wastetoenergy businesses should have been recharacterized as disguised sale transactions this issue is currently before the appeals division of the irs 

 

for both of the matters described above the potential tax and interest through december 31 2008 to the extent unpaid has been fully reserved for in our consolidated balance sheet a disallowance would not 

materially affect our consolidated results of operations however a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made in addition for the capital loss deduction matter described above the potential penalty and penaltyrelated interest through december 31 2008 has also been fully reserved for in our consolidated balance sheet the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in this matter would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations however a payment of penalty and penaltyrelated interest would adversely impact our cash flows in the period such payment was made the accrual of additional interest charges through the time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations in addition the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in connection with allied’s 2002 exchange of partnership interests could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

 

additionally during its examination of allied’s 2000 through 2003 tax years the irs proposed that certain landfill costs be allocated to the collection and control of methane gas that is naturally emitted from landfills the irs’ position is that the methane gas emitted by a landfill constitutes a joint product resulting from landfill operations and therefore associated costs should not be expensed until the methane gas is sold or otherwise disposed we believe we have several meritorious defenses including the fact that methane gas is not actively produced for sale by us but rather arises naturally in the context of providing disposal services therefore we believe that the resolution of this issue will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

for additional information on these matters see note 10 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

other matters may also arise in the course of tax audits that could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected should we fail to maintain investment grade ratings 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses pay dividends reduce indebtedness and minimize borrowings and take other actions to enhance shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate or that we will be able to increase the amount of such dividends 

 

a downgrade in our bond ratings could adversely affect our liquidity by increasing the cost of debt and financial assurance instruments 

 

while downgrades of our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on our cost of debt or liquidity they may impact our cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term if the rating agencies downgrade our debt this may increase the interest rate we must pay to issue new debt and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt if our debt ratings are downgraded future access to financial assurance markets at a reasonable cost or at all also may be adversely impacted 

the solid waste industry is a capitalintensive industry and the amount we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our ability to remain competitive and to grow and expand our operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital if our capital efficiency programs are unable to offset the impact of inflation and business growth it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend additionally if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations the amount we expend on capital capping closure postclosure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase our cash needs will also increase if the expenditures for capping closure postclosure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 

 

further federal regulations have tightened the emission standards on class a vehicles which includes the collection vehicles we purchase as a result we could experience an increase in capital costs and a reduction in operating efficiency this could also cause an increase in vehicle operating costs we may reduce the number of vehicles we purchase until manufacturers adopt the new standards to increase efficiency 

 

we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 

 

there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate nonhazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning environmental and other regulations these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures local communities and citizen groups adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities maintaining permits for our facilities or expanding existing facilities our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our nonhazardous solid waste landfills could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows in addition we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our landfills either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 

 

the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulation and existing or future regulations may restrict our operations increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures 

 

if we inadequately accrue for landfill capping closure and postclosure costs our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

a landfill must be closed and capped and postclosure maintenance commenced once the permitted capacity of the landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized we have significant financial obligations relating to capping closure and postclosure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated disposal facilities we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping closure and postclosure financial obligations we could underestimate such accruals and our financial obligations for capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose such a shortfall could result in significant 

unanticipated charges to income additionally if a landfill is required to be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason the accruals for capping closure and postclosure could be required to be accelerated which could have a material adverse impact our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at currently estimated volumes due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal caused by state requirements or voluntary initiatives 

 

most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning composting and recycling or other programs some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard waste at landfills although such actions are useful in protecting our environment these actions as well as voluntary private initiatives by customers to reduce waste or seek disposal alternatives have and may in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas if this occurs there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 

 

the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects expansion projects or pending acquisitions not being completed or certain other events could result in a material charge to income 

 

we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development expansion and other projects if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired or a development or expansion project is not completed or is determined to be impaired we will charge any unamortized capitalized expenditures to income relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale transfer or otherwise in future periods we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy or other events may cause impairments such charges could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flowcontrol regulations that may affect our operating margins restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 

 

complying with laws and regulations governing the use treatment storage transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials air quality water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations in addition environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping closure and postclosure and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 

 

our collection transfer and landfill operations are and may in the future continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state county or other jurisdictional lines such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 

 

in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who may allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations or who assert claims alleging environmental damage personal injury or property damage as a result we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked a significant judgment 

against us the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 

 

we may have potential environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance changes in insurance markets may also impact our financial results 

 

we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

also due to the variable condition of the insurance market we may experience future increases in selfinsurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

despite our efforts we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 

 

we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a “hazardous substance” on parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances was disposed of and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site hundreds of substances are defined as “hazardous” under cercla and their presence even in minute amounts can result in substantial liability notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances we may have additional liability under cercla or similar laws in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills or in waste collected transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences including judgments or settlements 

 

we are and from time to time become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities the timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain additionally the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we may need to add administrative and other personnel and will need to make additional investments in operations and systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management in addition competition among our competitors for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates as such we cannot assure you that 

 

  

if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental remediation or contractual as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we expect to try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each of the sellers of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by management actual results could differ from these amounts significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgements about matters that are inherently uncertain include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation employee benefit and pension plans deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance 

 

there can be no assurance that the liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to management 

 

the introduction of new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

complying with new accounting rules laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or funding requirements or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 

we may be subject to workforce influences including work stoppages which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 

 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 27 of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions if in the future our unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 

 

our obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us 

 

we contribute to at least 25 multiemployer pension plans covering at least 22 of our current employees we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans the pension protection act enacted in 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios we do not have current plan financial information for the multiemployer plans to which we contribute but based on the information available to us we believe that some of them are underfunded we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding if any we may be required to make to these plans and therefore have not recorded any related liabilities however plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period furthermore under current law upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or in the event of a mass withdrawal of contributing employers we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities there can be no assurance that there will not be a termination of or mass withdrawal of employers contributing to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that in the event of such a termination or mass withdrawal the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

 

the costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan which is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets the recent significant decline in the markets resulted in our recording a value for the plan assets that significantly differed from the plan asset value allied had recorded in its financial statements prior to the merger a continuation or further decline in the value of these investments could increase our pension expenses and related funding requirements in the future additionally our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions interest rates and other factors a significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the loss of key personnel could have material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are involved in routine judicial and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and that relate to among other things personal injury or property damage claims employment matters and commercial and contractual disputes we are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations due to the nature of our business we are also often routinely a party to judicial or administrative proceedings involving governmental authorities and other interested parties related to environmental regulations or liabilities from time to time we may also be subject to actions brought by citizens’ groups adjacent landowners or others in connection with the permitting and licensing of our landfills or transfer stations or alleging personal injury environmental damage or violations of the permits and licenses pursuant to which we operate 

 

we are subject to various federal state and local tax rules and regulations these rules are extensive and often complex and we are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by taxing authorities accordingly we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities if upon audit any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 

 

the following is a discussion of certain proceedings against us although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty except as identified below we do not believe that the outcome of our pending legal and administrative proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

litigation related to the merger with allied 

 

on july 25 2008 a putative class action was filed and on august 15 2008 was amended in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by the new jersey carpenters pension and the new jersey carpenters annuity funds against us and the members of our board of directors individually 

 

on august 21 2008 a second putative class action was filed in the court of chancery of the state of delaware by david shade against us the members of republic’s board of directors individually and allied on september 22 2008 the new jersey carpenters and the shade cases were consolidated by the court of chancery and on september 24 2008 the plaintiffs in the delaware case now known as in re republic services inc shareholders litigation filed a verified consolidated amended class action complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware 

 

on september 5 2008 a putative class action was filed in the circuit court in and for broward county florida by the teamsters local 456 annuity fund against us and the members of republic’s board of directors individually 

 

both the delaware consolidated action and the florida action were brought on behalf of a purported class of our stockholders and primarily sought among other things to enjoin the proposed transaction between republic and allied as well as damages and attorneys’ fees the actions also sought to compel us to 

accept the unsolicited proposals made by waste or at least compel our board of directors to further consider and evaluate the waste proposals which proposals were subsequently withdrawn 

 

on september 24 2008 the defendants in the florida litigation filed a motion to stay or to dismiss the lawsuit in light of the consolidated delaware class action 

 

on october 17 2008 plaintiffs in the consolidated delaware action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to require the defendants to make certain additional disclosures prior to the stockholder vote on the merger 

 

on october 29 2008 the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs regarding the settlement of the delaware and florida actions as part of this memorandum of understanding we agreed to make certain additional disclosures to our stockholders and such disclosures were made by us in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on october 30 2008 as of january 16 2009 following completion of certain confirmatory discovery by counsel to plaintiffs the parties executed a stipulation of settlement the stipulation of settlement is subject to customary conditions including court approval following notice to our stockholders the stipulation of settlement provides that a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement which if finally approved by the court will resolve all of the claims that were or could have been brought in the actions being settled including all claims relating to the merger transaction the merger agreement our rejections of the unsolicited waste proposals and any disclosures made in connection therewith the stipulation of settlement also provides that plaintiffs’ counsel may petition the court for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to be paid by us on february 20 2009 the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreed to in the stipulation and set a final hearing to consider the fairness of the settlement for may 19 2009 there can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement agreed to in the stipulation of settlement in such event the settlement may be terminated 

 

on december 3 2008 the doj and seven state attorneys general filed a complaint hold separate stipulation and order and competitive impact statement together with a proposed final judgment in the united states district court for the district of columbia in connection with approval under the hsr act of our merger with allied the court entered the hold separate stipulation and order on december 4 2008 which terminated the waiting period under the hsr act and allowed the parties to close the transaction subject to the conditions described in the hold separate stipulation and order these conditions include the divestiture of certain assets however the final judgment can only be approved by the court after the doj publishes a notice in the federal register and considers comments it receives during this period if the doj believes that the final judgment is no longer in the public interest the doj may withdraw its support of the final judgment and seek to prevent the final judgment from becoming final in its present form likewise the court may in its discretion modify the divestitures or other relief sought by the doj if the court believes that such modification is in the public interest the precise timing for the confirmation of the final judgment is not known management believes that the court will enter the final judgment and that modifications to the final judgment if any will not be material 

 

landfill and environmental 

 

we have been notified that we are considered a potentially responsible party at a number of sites under cercla or other environmental laws in all cases such alleged responsibility is due to the actions of companies prior to the time we acquired them we continually review our status with respect to each site taking into account the alleged connection to the site and the extent of the contribution to the volume of waste at the site the available evidence connecting the entity to that site and the number and financial soundness of other potentially responsible parties at the site the ultimate amounts for environmental liabilities at sites where we may be a potentially responsible party cannot be determined and estimates of such liabilities made by us require assumptions about future events subject to a number of uncertainties including the extent of the contamination the appropriate remedy the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 

where we have concluded that our share of potential liabilities is probable and can be reasonably estimated a provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements since the ultimate outcome of these matters may differ from the estimates used in our assessments to date the recorded liabilities are periodically evaluated as additional information becomes available to ascertain that the accrued liabilities are adequate we have liabilities recorded for environmental matters as of december 31 2008 of approximately 3899 million it is reasonably possible that we could have adjustments to our estimates for these matters in the near term that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for more information about our potential environmental liabilities see note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

countywide matter 

 

on march 26 2007 the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued final findings and orders fos to republic services of ohio ii llc republicohio an ohio limited liability company and our wholly owned subsidiary the fos relate to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum production waste at the countywide recycling and disposal facility countywide in east sparta ohio the fos and certain other remedial actions republicohio agreed with the oepa to undertake to address the environmental conditions include without limitation the following actions a prohibiting leachate recirculation b refraining from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the site c updating engineering plans and specifications and providing further information regarding the integrity of various engineered components at the site d performing additional data collection e taking additional measures to address emissions f expanding the gas collection and control system g installing a “fire” break h removing liquids from gas extraction wells and i submitting a plan to the oepa to suppress the chemical reaction and following approval by the oepa implementing such plan we also paid approximately 7 million in sanctions to comply with the fos during the three months ended march 31 2007 republicohio has performed certain interim remedial actions required by the oepa but the oepa has not approved republicohio’s plan to suppress the chemical reaction 

 

republicohio received additional orders from the oepa requiring certain actions to be taken by republicohio including additional air quality monitoring and the installation and continued maintenance of gas well dewatering systems republicohio has also entered into an agreed order on consent aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republicohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system b design and install a composite cap or cover and c develop and implement an air monitoring program the aoc became effective on april 17 2008 and republicohio has complied with the terms of the aoc republicohio also is in the process of constructing an additional “fire” break under the authority and supervision of the epa 

 

we had learned that the commissioner of the stark county health department commission recommended that the stark county board of health board of health suspend countywide’s 2007 annual operating license we had also learned that the commissioner intended to recommend that the board of health deny countywide’s license application for 2008 republicohio obtained a preliminary injunction on november 28 2007 prohibiting the board of health from suspending its 2007 operating license republicohio also obtained a preliminary injunction on february 15 2008 prohibiting the board of health from denying its 2008 operating license application the litigation with the board of health is pending in the stark county court of common pleas we and the board of health have been participating in discussions regarding facility licensing that have resulted in an agreement whereby republicohio will secure its operating license and pay 100 million to resolve the issues at countywide the specific terms of the agreement are being finalized 

 

we believe that we have performed or are diligently performing all actions required under the fos and the aoc and that countywide does not pose a threat to the environment additionally we believe that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating license at countywide 

we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the fos and the other required remedial actions 

 

in a suit filed on october 8 2008 in the tuscarawas county ohio court of common pleas approximately 700 plaintiffs have named republic services inc and republicohio as defendants the claims alleged are negligence and nuisance and arise from the operation of countywide republicohio has owned and operated countywide since february 1 1999 waste management inc and waste management ohio inc previous owners and operators of countywide have been named as defendants as well plaintiffs are individuals and businesses located in the geographic area around countywide they claim that due to the acceptance of a specific waste stream and operational issues and conditions the landfill has generated odors and other unsafe emissions which have allegedly impaired the use and value of their property there are also allegations that the emissions from the landfill may have adverse health effects the relief requested includes compensatory damages punitive damages costs for medical monitoring and screening interest on damages costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney and expert witness fees we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’ allegations 

 

sunrise matter 

 

on august 1 2008 republic services of southern nevada rssn our wholly owned subsidiary signed a consent decree with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill under the consent decree rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county were otherwise jointly and severally liable we were also assessed 10 million in sanctions related to the consent decree rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree however we have not recorded any potential recoveries 

 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the remediation liabilities recorded to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

carter valley matter 

 

on april 12 2006 federal agents executed a search warrant at bfi waste systems of tennessee llc’s carter valley landfill the landfill and seized information regarding the landfill’s receipt of special waste from one of its commercial customers on the same date the us attorney’s office for the eastern district of tennessee served a grand jury subpoena on us seeking related documents the 2006 subpoena shortly thereafter the government agreed to an indefinite extension of our time to respond to the subpoena and there were no further communications between us and the federal government until 2008 in 2007 while the federal investigation was pending the tennessee department of environment and conservation investigated the landfill’s receipt of the same special waste determined that there was not a sufficient basis to conclude that the landfill had disposed of hazardous waste and took no enforcement action on april 2 2008 the us attorney’s office issued a new grand jury subpoena seeking the same categories of documents requested in the 2006 subpoena we are currently producing documents in response to the 2008 subpoena on january 21 2009 the doj sent a letter to us stating that it believed based on its initial investigation that certain unnamed employees at the landfill had violated the rcra and that we were liable for these criminal violations under the theory of respondeat superior  if convicted pursuant to applicable law we could be subject to a wide range of criminal or civil 

penalties criminal penalties may not be more than the greatest of a maximum of 50000 for each day of violation a calculation of twice the gross pecuniary gain from the offense or a maximum of 500000 we could also be subject to civil penalties of 32500 per day per violation we intend to meet with the doj as soon as practicable to discuss the government’s investigation and understand the basis for the government’s belief that our employees violated rcra 

 

tax matters 

 

we and our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the us and puerto rico as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions we acquired allied’s open tax periods as part of the acquisition allied is currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years including federal income tax audits for calendar years 2000 through 2006 we are also engaged in tax litigation as a result of our risk management companies these matters are further discussed below 

 

risk management companies 

 

prior to allied’s acquisition of bfi on july 30 1999 bfi operating companies as part of a risk management initiative to manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities contributed assets and existing environmental and selfinsurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs subsequently the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately 9000 million for tax purposes calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 

 

on january 18 2001 the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a “potentially abusive tax shelter” under irs regulations during 2002 the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss at the time of the disallowance the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent and therefore not liabilities recognized for tax purposes under the irs interpretation there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximated the proceeds received allied protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august 2002 

 

in april 2005 the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction as a result in late april 2005 allied paid a deficiency to the irs of 226 million for bfi tax years prior to the acquisition allied also received a notification from the irs assessing a penalty of 54 million and interest of 128 million relating to the asserted 226 million deficiency in july 2005 allied filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims cfc the government thereafter filed a counterclaim in the case for the 54 million penalty and 128 million of interest claimed by the irs in december 2005 the irs agreed to suspend the collection of this penalty and interest until a decision is rendered on allied’s suit for refund 

 

in july 2006 while the cfc case was pending allied discovered what it construed to be a jurisdictional defect in the case that could have prevented its recovery of the refund amounts claimed even if allied would have been successful on the underlying merits accordingly in september 2006 allied filed a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice on jurisdictional grounds in march 2007 the cfc granted allied’s motion dismissing the case thereafter in july 2007 the government appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit federal circuit in april 2008 the federal circuit reversed the lower court’s decision and remanded the case back to the cfc for further proceedings in may 2008 allied filed a petition for panel rehearing with the federal circuit requesting that the court reconsider its ruling in june 2008 the federal circuit denied allied’s petition 

 

in december 2008 a hearing was held in the cfc at this hearing we informed the judge of our intention to withdraw our suit from the cfc in order to continue to litigate the merits of our position in the us district 

court of arizona we believe the decisional law applicable to this matter is more favorable to taxpayers in the us district court of arizona than in the cfc 

 

to expedite the withdrawal from the cfc in january 2009 we paid the government’s counterclaim for penalty and penaltyrelated interest of approximately 110 million prior to december 31 2008 allied had already paid 510 million in tax and related interest relating to the 1997 through 1999 bfi tax years as a result we have paid all tax interest and penalty related to the 1997 through 1999 bfi tax years which are the tax years under cfc jurisdiction if in response to our decision to withdraw our suit from the cfc the court issues an order dismissing the case with prejudice the tax interest and penalty amounts paid by us will not be recoverable in any subsequent action however if the court issues an order dismissing the case without prejudice we will not be entirely prevented from asserting a claim contesting the irs tax adjustment applicable to the 1997 through 1999 bfi tax years and seeking the recovery of some or all of the tax interest and penalty amounts previously paid although some of our claim may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations 

 

in addition allied has a second refund suit currently pending in arizona in august 2008 allied received from the irs a statutory notice of deficiency notice related to its utilization of bfi’s capital loss carryforward on allied’s 1999 tax return because of the high rate of interest associated with this matter allied previously paid all tax and interest related to this tax year consequently the notice related only to the irs’ asserted penalty for allied’s 1999 tax year on october 30 2008 allied filed a suit for refund in the us district court of arizona we anticipate that the doj will file a counterclaim for the asserted penalty and consequently the irs will suspend collection of the penalty as occurred in connection with the cfc action however there can be no assurance that the irs will suspend collection efforts 

 

if the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed for all applicable years we estimate that it would have a total cash impact including amounts already paid to the irs as described below of approximately 4570 million related to federal taxes state taxes and interest and approximately 1640 million related to penalty and penaltyrelated interest these amounts have been fully accrued on our consolidated balance sheet and disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations however a payment beyond the amounts already paid would adversely impact our cash flows in the period such payment was made the accrual of additional interest charges through the time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations due to the high rate of interest associated with this matter we have previously paid the irs and various state tax authorities 3690 million related to capital loss deductions taken on bfi’s 1997 through 1999 and allied’s 1999 through 2002 tax returns in addition we have paid approximately 110 million of penalty and penaltyrelated interest for our refund suit in the cfc although we have fully accrued all tax interest penalty and penaltyrelated interest relating to this matter we intend to vigorously pursue our claim for refund of the tax and interest and our defense to the irs’ claims for penalties and penaltyrelated interest while there can be no assurances we anticipate that the final resolution of the dispute through adjudication or settlement may be more favorable than the full amount currently accrued for tax interest penalty and penaltyrelated interest 

 

exchange of partnership interests 

 

in april 2002 allied exchanged minority partnership interests in four wastetoenergy facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment purchasing businesses which are now wholly owned subsidiaries in november 2008 the irs issued a formal disallowance to allied contending that the exchange was instead a sale on which a corresponding gain should have been recognized although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter if the exchange is treated as a sale we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately 1560 million plus accrued interest through december 31 2008 of approximately 480 million in addition the irs has asserted a penalty of 20 of the additional income tax due the potential tax and interest but not penalties or penaltyrelated interest of a full adjustment for this matter have been fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 the successful assertion by the irs of penalty and penaltyrelated interest in 

connection with this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a risk factors 

 

overview of our business 

 

as of december 31 2008 we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 400 collection companies in 40 states and puerto rico we also own or operate 242 transfer stations 213 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities 

 

in early 2008 we began to experience the impact of the economic slowdown on our operations this slowdown intensified during 2008 which combined with a tightening of the credit markets resulted in unprecedented changes in the us and global economies against this backdrop consumption in the us slowed dramatically new housing construction a primary driver of our temporary industrial collection business declined in excess of 40 compared to 2007 more recently we are seeing a slowdown in commercial construction a slowdown in manufacturing has resulted in a decrease in our permanent industrial collection business furthermore volumes in our commercial collection business began to decline in the second half of 2008 as consumers decreased discretionary spending we are also beginning to see lower commercial volumes due to store closures and increased commercial vacancies fuel prices which reached historic highs in the summer dropped quickly in the fall of 2008 this decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in fuel surcharges and therefore did not significantly improve our profitability in addition prices for recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in global demand although we hedged a portion of our commodity sales declines in commodity prices have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our profitability 

 

despite the challenging economic environment our business performed well during 2008 due in large part to the indispensible nature of our services and the scalability of our business our internal revenue growth during 2008 was 25 increases in core price and fuel recovery fees offset volume declines this increase in price and fuel recovery fees together with cost control steps taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes also served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising costs and declining revenue due to decreases in service volumes 

 

during december 2008 we completed our merger with allied forming the second largest waste management company in the us we believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders 

 

we expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the latter part of 2008 will continue throughout 2009 we anticipate a decrease in volumes in all lines of our business we also anticipate that prices for recycling commodities will remain depressed however we believe that we will benefit from our cost control and pricing initiatives ours is a capital intensive business slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy in addition we intend to focus our attention on integrating our newly merged company and achieving cost synergies as a result of the merger 

 

business acquisitions and divestitures 

 

we make decisions to acquire invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

merger with allied waste industries inc 

 

on june 22 2008 republic entered into an agreement and plan of merger with allied prior to the merger allied was the second largest provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection transfer recycling and disposal services in the united states as measured by revenue the completion of the merger was subject to certain terms and conditions including but not limited to approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both republic and allied regulatory approval from the doj and receipt of credit ratings for the combined company classifying our senior unsecured debt as investment grade having met those terms and conditions on december 5 2008 we completed the merger 

 

as of the effective date of the merger each share of allied common stock outstanding was converted into 45 shares of our common stock we issued approximately 1958 million shares of common stock to allied stockholders in the merger allied stockholders received approximately 52 of the outstanding common stock of the combined company in respect of their allied shares on a diluted basis as a result of the merger and republic stockholders retained approximately 48 of the outstanding common stock of the combined company on a diluted basis the total purchase price paid for allied including the value of common stock issued based on the average closing prices of republic’s common stock for the fiveday period around june 23 2008 the announcement date totaled approximately 115 billion 

 

republic has been determined to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141 business combinations sfas 141 therefore we have accounted for the merger as an acquisition of allied by republic using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of allied from the date of the acquisition and have not been retroactively restated to include allied’s historical financial position or results of operations in accordance with the purchase method of accounting the purchase price paid has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition and until we have completed our valuation process there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation 

 

cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill associated with the acquisition of allied totaled 90 billion in addition when we acquire landfills as part of a group of assets we allocate part of the purchase price to airspace based on the estimated fair value of the landfills relative to the fair value of other assets within the acquired group we allocated 26 billion of the total purchase price paid for the acquisition of allied to landfill airspace landfill purchase price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 

 

as a condition of the merger with allied we reached a settlement with the doj requiring us to divest of assets serving fifteen metropolitan areas including los angeles and san francisco ca denver co atlanta ga northwestern indiana lexington ky flint mi cape girardeau mo charlotte nc cleveland oh philadelphia pa greenvillespartanburg sc and fort worth houston and lubbock tx the settlement requires us to divest of 87 commercial waste collection routes nine municipal solid waste landfills and ten transfer stations together with ancillary assets and in three cases access to landfill disposal capacity in february 2009 we entered into an agreement to divest certain assets to waste connections inc the assets that are being divested under this agreement include six municipal solid waste landfills six collection operations and three transfer stations across the following seven markets los angeles ca denver co houston tx lubbock tx greenvillespartanburg sc charlotte nc and flint mi the transaction with waste connections is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence regulatory approval and other customary matters closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2009 combined revenue of the assets being sold is approximately 1100 million 

 

during december 2008 we incurred 827 million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with allied these charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties 

other business acquisitions and divestitures 

 

in addition to the acquisition of allied in december 2008 we acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was 134 million 44 million and 49 million respectively 

 

cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill associated with these acquisitions during 2008 2007 and 2006 totaled 22 million 10 million and 10 million respectively 

 

in november 2007 we divested of our texasbased compost mulch and soil business and received proceeds of 365 million a gain of 125 million was recorded in 2007 on this divestiture 

 

revenue 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal and recycling 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by service line for the respective years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 

 

our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal during december 2008 subsequent to our acquisition of allied approximately 67 of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills that we own or operate 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all 

costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is shown in the following table in millions except percentages 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments we acquired allied on december 5 2008 and due to the timing of the acquisition management reviewed and we have presented allied as a separate reportable segment in our 

consolidated financial statements in addition during the first quarter of 2008 we consolidated our southwestern operations into our western region and accordingly the historical operating results of our southwestern operations have been consolidated into our western region 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

  

the operating loss in 2008 includes remediation charges of 999 million related to estimated costs to comply with the fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa related to our countywide facility and an impairment charge of 759 million related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at countywide based upon recent negotiations with the oepa and epa it also includes 110 million of settlement reserves for certain legal matters 

 

operating income for 2007 includes a 446 million charge to operating expenses associated with environmental conditions at countywide 

 

  

operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to an adjustment to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas 143 during 2007 

 

  

operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue lower disposal costs and lower insurance costs 

 

  

operating income in 2008 includes a 340 million charge related to estimated costs to comply with a consent decree and settlement agreement signed with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill it also includes a 219 million charge recorded during 2008 associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california 

 

operating income in 2007 includes an 81 million increase in landfill operating costs and a 52 million increase in sfas 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california 

 

 42 

 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

 

  

operating margins decreased from 162 to 115 primarily because of a 446 million charge to operating income associated with environmental conditions at our countywide facility 

 

  

operating margins increased due to higher revenue lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas 143 this increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and landfill operating costs 

 

  

operating margins increased primarily due to higher revenue lower disposal costs due to drier weather lower truck and equipment maintenance costs and lower labor costs 

 

  

operating margins decreased because of an 81 million increase in landfill operating costs and a 52 million increase in sfas 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california 

 

  

2008 business performance 

 

during 2008 our internal revenue growth was 25 with a 40 increase in core price offset by a 39 decrease in core volume during 2008 we experienced lower volumes in all of our lines of business due to the economic slowdown revenue growth from fuel surcharges and environmental fees was 18 and 4 respectively in addition our merger with allied in december 2008 resulted in a 134 increase in revenue 

the cost of fuel increased significantly during the summer and fall of 2008 the economic slowdown helped to moderate fuel prices in the later part of the year fuel ended the year at levels consistent with those experienced during 2007 this decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in fuel surcharges and therefore did not significantly improve our profitability 

 

also during 2008 prices for recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in global demand although we hedged a portion of our commodity sales declines in commodity prices have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our profitability 

 

2009 business initiatives 

 

our business initiatives for 2009 focus on the timely integration of our operations with allied’s while remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have made us successful our initiatives include 

 

  

consolidated results of operations 

 

years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

our net income was 738 million for the year ended december 31 2008 or 37 per diluted share compared to 2902 million or 151 per diluted share in 2007 and 2796 million or 139 per diluted share in 2006 

 

in january 2007 our board of directors approved a 3for2 stock split in the form of a stock dividend effective on march 16 2007 to stockholders of record as of march 5 2007 we distributed approximately 645 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock split our shares per share data and weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock split 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a number of charges and other expenses that impacted our pretax income net income and diluted earnings per share these items primarily consist of the following in millions except per share data 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table summarizes our operating revenue costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

revenue revenue was 37 billion 32 billion and 31 billion for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively revenue increased 5089 million or 160 from 2007 to 2008 our acquisition of allied in december 2008 contributed 4637 million to this increase in revenue revenue 

increased by 1056 million or 34 from 2006 to 2007 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

  

cost of operations cost of operations was 24 billion 20 billion and 19 billion or as a percentage of revenue 656 631 and 627 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily a result of our acquisition of allied in december 2008 the remaining increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars and the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008 of 980 million related to estimated costs to comply with fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility in ohio 219 million related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility 

in contra costa county california and 340 million related to environmental conditions at the sunrise landfill the increase in cost of operations and as a percentage of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily a result of the 410 million charge we recorded in cost of operations related to environmental conditions at our countywide facility and an 81 million charge related to our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

a description of our cost categories is as follows 

 

 47 

 

  

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 3423 million 2990 million and 2890 million or as a percentage of revenue 93 94 and 94 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 is primarily due to our acquisition of allied in december 2008 the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is partially due to 33 million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under sfas 143 in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred approximately 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility depreciation expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program 

 

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets that have a finite life and are amortized generally consist of customer relationships longterm contracts and covenants not to compete expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 118 million 65 million and 70 million or as a percentage of revenue 3 2 and 2 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of allied we expect this acquisition will increase our intangible asset amortization expense by approximately 650 million in 2009 

 

accretion expense accretion expense was 239 million 171 million and 157 million or as a percentage of revenue 7 5 and 5 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with our acquisition of allied the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of 975 which is higher than the creditadjusted riskfree rate we have used historically to record such obligations our accretion expense in 2009 will reflect the increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in the acquisition of allied and the impact of using a higher overall average discount rate for recording these liabilities 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 4347 million 3137 million and 3150 million or as a percentage of revenue 118 99 and 103 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

the increase in such expenses both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to 142 million of bad debt expense related to conforming allied’s methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and 54 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures this increase is also due to 243 million of settlement charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters 

 

excluding these costs selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 would have been 3908 million or 106 as a percentage of revenue the increase in selling 

general and administrative expenses excluding the costs mentioned above in aggregate dollars during 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to our merger with allied the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to our merger with allied and a 43 million reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts which we recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience 

 

the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to the expansion of our business the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and the 43 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2007 

 

upon the completion of the integration of allied our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative costs at no more than 100 of revenue which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform 

 

asset impairments during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a 759 million charge related to the impairment of our countywide facility this impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with fos issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa based upon recent negotiations with the oepa and the epa during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a loss of 61 million for expected losses on asset divestitures mandated by the doj also during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded 78 million of other impairment charges consisting primarily of charges related to our former corporate headquarters in south florida 

 

restructuring charges during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 827 million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with allied these charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties 

 

operating income operating income was 2832 million 5360 million and 5195 million or as a percentage of revenue 77 169 and 169 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the reduction in operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is primarily due to the remediation asset impairment and restructuring charges noted above 

 

interest expense we incurred interest expense primarily on our credit facilities senior notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 1319 million 948 million and 958 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to the additional debt we acquired as a result of our acquisition of allied in addition during december 2008 we incurred approximately 101 million of noncash interest expense this expense relates primarily to a 6243 million discount we recorded to fair value the debt we acquired from allied that is being amortized generally over the term of the related debt it also relates to accretion expenses associated with discounted environmental and risk insurance reserves 

 

capitalized interest was 26 million 30 million and 27 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

interest income and other income expense net interest income and other income net of other expense was 80 million 269 million and 200 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the amount in 2007 is primarily due to a 125 million gain related to the sale of our compost mulch and soil business in texas 

 

income taxes our provision for income taxes was 854 million 1779 million and 1641 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our effective income tax rate was 536 380 and 370 for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred several expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the 

merger with allied in addition lower pretax earnings contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 48 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a 51 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits for the years 1998 through 2000 

 

landfill and environmental matters 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 50 

 

as of december 31 2008 we owned or operated 213 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 49 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2008 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 45 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 4 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 8 landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

 

during 2008 total available airspace increased by a net 32 billion cubic yards due the merger with allied in december which contributed 157 active landfills representing 33 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace to our landfill assets excluding the merger with allied total available airspace decreased by a net 1 billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates and changes in design the decrease during 2008 due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at our countywide facility during 2007 total available airspace increased by a net 75 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken changes in engineering estimates and permits granted partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility during 2006 total available airspace decreased by 336 million cubic yards due to airspace consumption partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates 

 

at december 31 2005 101 of our total available airspace or 1777 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills at december 31 2008 78 of our total available airspace or 3862 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at 23 of our landfills between december 31 2005 and december 31 2008 we received permits for eight of our probable expansions which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

as of december 31 2008 23 of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 15 of which were added as a result of our acquisition of allied at projected annual volumes these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 32 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 42 years we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of december 31 2008 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 10 billion of which 1306 million is current and 9100 million is longterm as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

 

in december 2008 we recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of 2081 million for the environmental liabilities we acquired as part of the acquisition of allied these liabilities represent our preliminary estimate of our costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied or a predecessor company that they had acquired had been identified as a potentially responsible party the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of postremedial monitoring see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies — environmental remediation liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k for further information 

 

during 2007 we recorded pretax charges of 453 million related to estimated costs to comply with fos issued by the oepa in response to environmental conditions at countywide and to undertake certain other remedial actions that we agreed with the oepa to perform including without limitation installing a “fire” break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells we also recorded 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the oepa’s fos 

 

during 2008 republicohio an ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of countywide entered into an aoc with the epa requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the epa and requiring republicohio to a design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system b design and install a composite cap or cover and c develop and implement an air monitoring program the aoc became effective on april 17 2008 and republicohio is complying with the terms of the aoc we received additional orders from the oepa in 2008 based upon current information and engineering analyses and discussions with the oepa and epa subsequent to the signing of the abovementioned agreement we recorded an additional pretax charge for remediation costs of 980 million during 2008 these costs include placing an enhanced cap in excess of countywide’s current permit requirements over certain portions of the landfill 

 

we have requested relief with respect to certain requirements of the orders received from the oepa as we believe the requirements should no longer be considered essential in light of the work we have now agreed with the epa to perform 

 

while we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the fos and the additional remedial actions we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 

 

in addition during 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of 759 million related to a reduction in our estimated remaining airspace at countywide 

 

during 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of 96 million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control during 2008 we recorded an additional pretax charge of 219 million for increases in our estimated leachate disposal costs and leachate treatment equipment costs at this facility 

 

on august 1 2008 republic services of southern nevada rssn a wholly owned subsidiary of ours signed a consent decree and settlement agreement consent decree with the epa the bureau of land management and clark county nevada related to the sunrise landfill under the consent decree rssn has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the sunrise landfill for which rssn and clark county 

were otherwise jointly and severally liable as a result we recorded based on management’s best estimates a pretax charge of 350 million during 2008 of which 340 million was recorded for remediation costs associated with complying with the consent decree rssn is currently working with the clark county staff and board of commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the consent decree however we have not recorded any potential recoveries the majority of this remediation liability is expected to be paid during 2009 and 2010 

 

it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information to the extent that such information impacts the costs timing or duration of the required actions future changes in our estimates of the costs timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

no other significant amounts were charged to income for remediation costs during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate 

 

investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

the increase in the investment in our landfills both in aggregate dollars and as an investment per cubic yard is primarily due to the acquisition of allied in december 2008 landfill development cost in the above table include 26 billion of purchase price for the acquisition that has been allocated to the permitted and probable expansion airspace acquired based on its fair value as of the date of the acquisition the increase in depletion amortization and accretion expense from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to 58 million of accretion expense associated with capping closure and postclosure liabilities acquired from allied the asset retirement obligations acquired from allied are recorded using a discount rate of 975 which is higher than the rate we have historically used see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies regarding sfas 143 adjustments 

 

the increase in depletion amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is partially due to an increase of 33 million in landfill amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations at our landfills this increase is also partially due to 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense we recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 

 

during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our weightedaverage compaction rate was approximately 1650 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

 

as of december 31 2008 we expect to spend an estimated additional 61 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 93 billion or 189 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

selected balance sheet accounts 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts final capping closure postclosure liabilities environmental remediation liabilities and accrued selfinsurance during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 was 10 1 and 3 respectively the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended december 31 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to the following 272 million related to the acquisition of allied 142 million to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts acquired from 

allied to conform to republic’s accounting policies and 54 million related to providing for specific bankruptcy exposures the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to an adjustment we recorded in 2007 of 43 million as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience as of december 31 2008 accounts receivable were 9455 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 657 million resulting in days sales outstanding of 40 or 25 days net of deferred revenue at december 31 2008 our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled 594 million or 59 of gross receivables outstanding 

 

our expense for selfinsurance which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees as a percentage of revenue for 2008 2007 and 2006 was 55 59 and 54 respectively the decrease in selfinsurance expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to lower health insurance costs the increase in selfinsurance expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims 

 

property and equipment 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are discussed below 

 

cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 5122 million 6613 million and 5112 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments made for accounts payable and federal income taxes cash flow for the year ended 

december 31 2008 was negatively impacted by 1323 million of payments made to the irs for interest and taxes related to the risk management companies matter discussed in item 3 legal proceed ings this payment was accrued by allied and in our purchase accounting for the acquisition and paid in december 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and taxes on this matter additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 we paid approximately 830 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005 this tax payment had been deferred as a result of an irs notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 

 

we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions dividend payments and debt repayments 

 

cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was 9347 million 2603 million and 2045 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented cash paid net of cash acquired of 5404 million related to the acquisition of allied in 2008 cash provided by the disposition of our compost mulch and soil business in texas in 2007 and cash provided by a decrease in restricted cash in 2006 capital additions were 3869 million 2925 million and 3267 million during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively cash used to acquire businesses net of cash acquired was 5538 million 44 million and 49 million during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 

 

cash flows provided by used in financing activities cash provided by financing activities was 4694 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and cash used in financing activities was 4083 million and 4094 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and consists primarily of purchases of common stock for treasury proceeds from and payments of notes payable and longterm debt proceeds from issuances of common stock due to stock option exercises and payments of cash dividends purchases of common stock for treasury were 1384 million 3628 million and 4920 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively dividends paid were 1283 million 939 million and 785 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

from 2000 through 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 26 billion of our common stock as of december 31 2008 we paid 23 billion to repurchase 826 million shares of our common stock of which 1384 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase 46 million shares of our common stock the stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of 2008 due to the pending merger with allied we expect that the share repurchase program will continue to be suspended until at least 2011 

 

we used cash on hand cash flows from operations and proceeds from issuances of taxexempt bonds to fund capital expenditures repay debt and fund acquisitions we intend to use the proceeds from asset divestitures in 2008 to repay debt we intend to finance future dividend payments through cash on hand cash flows from operations our revolving credit facilities and other financings 

 

financial condition 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 687 million of cash and cash equivalents we also had 2819 million of restricted cash deposits including 1335 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 

 

in conjunction with the merger with allied we entered into a 175 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks in september 2008 the credit facility matures in september 2013 it was used initially at the time of the merger to refinance borrowings and letters of credit under allied’s senior credit facility to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger since the merger borrowings under the new credit facility are being used for working capital 

capital expenditures letters of credit and other general corporate purposes borrowings under the 175 billion credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate both terms defined in the agreements plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings also a term defined in the agreements see note 9 debt  to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k at december 31 2008 we had 1689 million available under the 175 billion credit facility 

 

in april 2007 we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility to 10 billion and extended the term to 2012 in september 2008 we amended the 10 billion credit facility to conform certain terms of the facility to be consistent with the new 175 billion revolving credit facility we did not change the maturity date of the credit facility borrowings under the 10 billion credit facility bear interest at a base rate or a eurodollar rate both terms defined in the agreements plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings also a term defined in the agreements at december 31 2008 we had 2296 million available under the 10 billion credit facility 

 

in may 1999 we sold 3750 million of unsecured notes in the public market these notes bear interest at 7125 per annum and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and november the notes were offered at a discount of 5 million in march 2005 we exchanged 2757 million of our outstanding 7125 notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035 the new notes bear interest at 6086 we paid a premium of 276 million related to the exchange this premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method 

 

in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 675 and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million 

 

as part of our acquisition of allied in december 2008 we acquired allied’s then outstanding senior notes totaling 425 billion with interest rates ranging from 575 to 7875 and maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2017 995 million and 3600 million of allied’s debentures with interest rates of 925 and 740 and maturity dates of 2021 and 2035 respectively and 2300 million of allied’s 425 convertible debentures due 2034 

 

we also acquired 4000 million of receivables secured loans which bear interest at a market based interest rate plus a margin as defined in the agreement we intend to renew the accounts receivable securitization program when it matures in may 2009 however if we are unable to renew this facility at favorable terms we will refinance any then outstanding amounts with our existing credit facilities 

 

in addition we acquired 5270 million of taxexempt bonds with interest rates ranging from 515 to 1150 and maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2031 and other debt of 1067 million 

 

the total fair value of the debt acquired in the acquisition was 54 billion as of the effective date of the merger see note 9 debt to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k for further information regarding the debt acquired from allied 

 

in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 2100 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 675 our swap agreements mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 13 billion of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which 5270 million were acquired in the acquisition of allied in 2008 and 2074 million were issued during 2008 for republic projects borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 325 to 1150 at december 31 2008 and have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037 as of december 31 2008 we had 1335 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

we intend to use excess cash on hand cash from operating activities and proceeds from the asset divestitures to repay debt we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due despite the current economic conditions we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary 

 

credit rating 

 

we have received investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2008 our senior debt was rated bbb baa3 and bbb by standard  poor’s rating services inc moody’s investors service inc and fitch inc respectively 

 

fuel hedges 

 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices and other commodity prices we have entered into multiple option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases and other commodity prices under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges 

 

we have the following fuel hedges outstanding at december 31 2008 

 

 

 

if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price as published by the department of energy exceeds the contract price per gallon we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counterparty if the national us onhighway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from thirdparty counterparties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy the aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 117 million and 114 million respectively and have been recorded in other current liabilities and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

 

in accordance with sfas 133 the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 net of tax of 71 million and 69 million respectively have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income realized gains of 59 million and realized losses of 16 million and 13 million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

commodity hedges 

 

we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities we have entered into multiple agreements related to certain forecasted 

commodity sales under sfas 133 the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales commodity hedges 

 

we have the following commodity hedges outstanding at december 31 2008 

 

 

 

if the price per short ton of the hedging instrument average price as reported on the official board market is less than the contract price per short ton we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional short tons from the counterparty if the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton we pay the difference to the counterparty 

 

the fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from a thirdparty counterparty and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets level 2 in the fair value hierarchy the aggregated fair value of the outstanding commodity hedges at december 31 2008 was an asset of 88 million and has been recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas 133 the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2008 net of tax of 53 million have been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the changes in fair values as of december 31 2008 was immaterial and has been recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition to the above we have unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 of 6119 million of which we expect to settle approximately 100 million to 200 million within the following twelve months due to the 

uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 

 

we also have letters of credit of 17 billion outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and 1 billion outstanding under other agreements at december 31 2008 

 

debt covenants our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants we have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities we were also in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants of the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31 2008 

 

on december 10 2008 we received the requisite consents for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt securities of allied waste north america inc awna the amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing reporting obligations required of allied under the amended supplemental indentures the ongoing reporting obligations may be satisfied by republic 

 

the collateral that had secured the awna senior notes and the bfi debentures equally and ratably with the allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of the merger with allied and the repayment of that facility 

 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the revolving credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements this could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances in addition maturity acceleration on the revolving credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments including our senior notes and therefore our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity if such acceleration of maturities were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek an amendment under our revolving credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity or asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the revolving credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

financial assurance we are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping closure and postclosure costs and related to our performance under certain collection landfill and transfer station contracts we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds letters of credit insurance policies or trust deposits the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations the financial assurance requirements for capping closure and postclosure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill generally states will require a thirdparty engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping closure and postclosure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill the amount of financial assurance required can and generally will differ from the obligation determined and recorded under gaap the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 

 

additionally we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2009 although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

 

these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets however we record capping closure and postclosure liabilities and selfinsurance liabilities as they are incurred the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets would be 

recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations we do not expect this to occur 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt 

 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 was negatively impacted by 1323 million of payments made to the irs for interest and taxes related to the risk management companies matter discussed in item 3 legal proceedings  this payment was accrued by allied and included in our purchase accounting allocation for the acquisition and paid in december 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and taxes on this matter 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2008 was positively impacted due to approximately 320 million of federal tax payments being deferred until february 2009 as a result of our merger with allied 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by an 830 million federal tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until february 2006 as a result of an irs notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 

 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is as follows in millions 

 

 

 

the adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt paying cash dividends and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

contingencies 

 

for a description of our commitments and contingencies see note 10 income taxes and note 16 commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10k 

 

critical accounting judgments and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain such critical accounting policies estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 

 

we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 

 

accounting for the acquisition of allied 

 

acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with gaap the purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill the consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business these estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired 

 

republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of allied until we have completed our valuation process there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 the significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment other intangible assets landfill asset retirement obligations legal and environmental reserves selfinsurance reserves income taxes other noncurrent assets and longterm obligations and assets held for sale our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through december 31 2008 a portion of which will be paid in future periods 

 

changes in our estimates of fair values may impact our results of operations in future periods 

residual risks 

 

  

landfill accounting 

 

landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 

 

our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 

 

  

landfill development costs 

 

we use lifecycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site in lifecycle accounting all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are also capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 

 

site permits in order to develop construct and operate a landfill we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local state and federal levels the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 

 

residual risks 

 

  

technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval technical landfill designs are prepared the technical designs which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval upon approval of the technical designs the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 

residual risks 

 

  

permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed the depth of excavation the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the sideslope construction the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a sitespecific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes installation of groundwater monitoring wells construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with thirdparty bids or contractual arrangements reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs these development costs together with any costs incurred to acquire design and permit the landfill including capitalized interest are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 

 

residual risk 

 

  

landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a perton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted but rather expressed in nominal dollars this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 

 

amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill including acquisition costs which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value amortization rates are also influenced by sitespecific engineering and cost factors 

residual risk 

 

  

on at least an annual basis we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

 

landfill asset retirement obligations 

 

we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills 1 capping and 2 closure and postclosure 

 

we account for our final capping closure and postclosure activities in accordance with sfas 143 under sfas 143 obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill depending on the nature of the obligation all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred future costs for final capping closure and postclosure are developed at least annually by engineers and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 

 

landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 

 

closure and postclosure closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a postclosure period which generally extends for 30 years costs associated with closure and postclosure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste costs associated with postclosure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling analysis and statistical reports thirdparty labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

 

landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets estimates of the total future costs required to cap close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually the estimates include inflation the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually 25 in both 2008 and 2007 

 

the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and postclosure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a perton basis these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 

 

capping closure and postclosure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our creditadjusted riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 66 in 2008 and 65 in 2007 

retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities this accretion expense is charged to operating expenses actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 

 

corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a perton basis as disposal capacity is consumed the perton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity a perton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event closure and postclosure perton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 

 

residual risks 

 

  

on an annual basis we update our estimates of future capping closure and postclosure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping closure and postclosure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 

 

in connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations we made a change in estimate which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle as defined by sfas 154 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3 sfas 154 this change which we believe is preferable was made to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped which is used to calculate our capping rates with the physical operation of our landfills the expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event this change resulted in a 326 million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets these assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate in accordance with sfas 154 this change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

permitted and probable disposal capacity as described previously disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit we classify this disposal capacity as permitted we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted however because some of these criteria are judgmental they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted in either of these scenarios our amortization depletion and accretion expense could change significantly our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows 

 

  

after successfully meeting these criteria the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates additionally for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping closure and postclosure rates we include the incremental costs to develop construct close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 

 

residual risk 

 

  

environmental liabilities 

 

we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment under current laws and regulations we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate including sites that we have acquired or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater surface water and soil contamination as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites we evaluate several factors including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site the required remediation methods the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are 

recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 

 

the majority of our environmental remediation liabilities were acquired as part of our acquisition of allied we have accounted for the environmental remediation liabilities we acquired from allied based on estimates of their fair values and we have discounted these liabilities in accordance with sfas 141 prior to our acquisition of allied allied’s environmental remediation liabilities were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies sfas 5 and american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities sop 961 which require that estimated losses be recorded for loss contingencies if prior to the issuance of the financial statements it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated if it is probable that a liability has been incurred but no estimate of the liability is more likely than any other a liability is recorded at the lower end of the range however amounts recorded under this guidance are generally not considered fair value 

 

our process for determining the fair value for the environmental liabilities we acquired includes first identifying the population of sites that we either are or have indications that we may be responsible for the costs of remediation these sites are then assessed to determine the risks that they are or may be subject to that would significantly affect either the cost or timing of remediation activities we use these risk scenarios to develop estimates of future cash flows based on the risks identified generally speaking sites with a higher risk of significant variability in future cash flows or timing of those cash flows have more risk scenarios identified than sites which we deem to be at a lower risk we then probabilityweight these risk scenarios and discount these liabilities to present value to determine their fair values although we have prepared and recorded a preliminary valuation of the environmental liabilities we acquired from allied we do not expect to complete our valuation of these liabilities until 2009 after we have finalized this valuation future changes in these estimates will be recorded in accordance with sfas 5 and sop 961 significant adjustments to these reserves may occur in the future 

 

our other environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas 5 and sop 961 the recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable these estimates do not take into account discounts to present value the total estimated costs we reevaluate these matters as additional information becomes available to ascertain whether the liabilities we have accrued are adequate we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 

 

residual risks 

 

  

selfinsurance reserves and related costs 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured accruals for selfinsurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported we maintain high deductibles for commercial 

general liability automobile liability and workers’ compensation coverages ranging from 10 million to 30 million 

 

residual risks 

 

  

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty consistent with sfas 5 we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities management’s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible we will disclose the potential range of the loss if estimable 

 

we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 

 

residual risks 

 

  

asset impairment 

 

valuation methodology we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 

 

residual risk 

 

  

evaluation criteria we test longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a longlived asset a change in its physical condition or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not 

that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

 

residual risk 

 

  

recognition criteria if such circumstances arise we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 

 

goodwill recoverability 

 

valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units which we define as our geographic operating segments we estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital which was approximately 70 in 2008

evaluation criteria we test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable for example a significant adverse change in our liquidity or the business environment unanticipated competition a significant adverse action by a regulator or the disposal of a significant portion of an operating segment could prompt an impairment test between annual assessments 

 

recognition criteria   we use a twostep test to evaluate goodwill impairment under the first step we compare the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the operating segment is less than its carrying value an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the operating segment and we perform step two of the impairment test 

 

for purposes of performing the second step we allocate the fair value of each operating segment to all the assets and liabilities of the operating segment as if the operating segment had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test we deduct the fair value of tangible net assets and other intangible assets from the fair value of each operating segment to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill for each operating segment if the implied fair value of an operating segment’s goodwill is lower than its carrying amount goodwill is impaired and we write it down to its implied fair value at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within an operating segment goodwill of the operating segment is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the operating segment and a gain or loss on disposal is determined subsequently the remaining goodwill in the operating segment from which the assets were divested is reevaluated for impairment which could result in an impairment charge

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 accordingly deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than nondeductible goodwill and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 

 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 fin 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties and accounting in interim periods 

 

we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other longterm tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets

defined benefit pension plans 

 

we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan the bfi retirement plan the plan as a result of our acquisition of allied in december 2008 the plan covers certain employees in the united states including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements the plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document the benefits of approximately 97 of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied’s acquisition of bfi in 1999 

 

our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and irc as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for 2009 

 

the plan’s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee at december 31 2008 the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds equity funds and cash we annually review and adjust the plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary 

 

residual risk 

 

  

assumptions the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 

 

we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date where that timing does not correspond to a published highquality bond rate our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability if the discount rate increases by 1 our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately 340 million if the discount rate were to decrease by 1 our benefit obligation would increase by approximately 390 million 

 

in developing our expected rate of return assumption we evaluate longterm expected and historical returns on the plan assets giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned less than 3 of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

the table below provides information about certain of our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt all items described below are nontrading 

 

 

 

the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates 

 

fuel price risk 

 

fuel costs represent a significant operating expense when economically practical we may enter into new or renewal contracts or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk where appropriate we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers we are unable to charge such fees to all customers consequently an increase in fuel costs results in 1 an increase in our cost of operations 2 a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and 3 a decrease in our operating margin percentage since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost conversely a decrease in fuel costs results in 1 a decrease in our cost of operations 2 a smaller decrease in our revenue and 3 an increase in our operating margin percentage 

 

at our current consumption levels a onecent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately 17 million on an annual basis which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers accordingly a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 

 

our operations also require the use of certain petroleumbased products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of oil an increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those products which would increase our operating and capital costs we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors 

 

commodities prices 

 

we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities as a result changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in 2008 2007 and 2006 were approximately 1211 million 1139 million and 801 million respectively

company overview 

 

we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 136 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 94 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities 

 

as of december 31 2007 our operations were organized into five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating segments 

 

we had revenue of 31762 million and 30706 million and operating income of 5360 million and 5195 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the 1056 million or 34 increase in revenue and the 165 million or 32 increase in operating income from 2006 to 2007 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below 

 

our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including california florida georgia nevada north carolina south carolina and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below 

 

we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

industry overview 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 52 billion of which approximately 58 is generated by publicly owned waste companies 16 is generated by privately held waste companies and 26 is generated by municipal and other local governmental authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue however according to industry data the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains highly fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 42 of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new households and business formation 

 

financial strategy 

 

key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct monthly field operating 

reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing free cash flow and maintaining and improving returns on invested capital 

 

the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following 

 

  

price growth growth through price increases is the most costeffective means of expanding our business price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs which ultimately enhances our operating margins 

 

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business 

 

  

for certain risks related to our financial strategy see item 1a “risk factors” 

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following 

 

  

for certain risks related to our operating strategy see item 1a “risk factors” 

 

  

james e o’connor who has served as our chief executive officer since december 1998 also became our chairman in january 2003 he worked at waste management inc from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr o’connor has over 33 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

michael j cordesman who has served as our chief operating officer since march 2002 and also as our president since february 2003 has over 27 years of experience in the solid waste industry he joined us in june 2001 as our eastern region vice president from 1999 to 2001 mr cordesman served as vice president of the central region for superior services inc from 1980 to 1999 he served in various positions with waste management inc including vice president of the midatlantic region from 1992 to 1999 

 

the other corporate officers with responsibility for our operations have an average of over 26 years of management experience in the solid waste industry our five regional vice presidents and our 21 area presidents have an average of 26 years of experience in the industry 

 

in addition harris w hudson who has served as our vice chairman since our initial public offering in 1998 has over 43 years of experience in the solid waste industry including 11 years with waste management inc and 19 years with private waste collection companies

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions for certain risks related to our growth strategy see item 1a “risk factors”

pricing activities we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs and to improve our operating margins during 2007 we continued to secure broadbased price increases across all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel price increases will remain a major component of our overall future operating strategy 

 

longterm contracts we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste in highgrowth markets these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets for example we have secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in highgrowth markets such as los angeles orange and contra costa counties in california las vegas nevada arlington texas and many areas of florida we believe that this positions our company to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate in addition we believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in highgrowth markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 

 

sales and marketing activities we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable our company to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate we currently have approximately 500 sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial industrial municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in addition we utilize a customer relationship management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts 

 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations and landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

 

  

  

we also seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue 

and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 21 states through 136 collection companies in 2007 759 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 332 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 392 is from services provided to commercial customers and 276 is from services provided to industrial and other customers 

 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by considerations such as the following 

 

  

we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

also we provide recycling services in certain markets in compliance with local laws or the terms of our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

transfer and disposal services we own or operate 94 transfer stations we deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities as of december 31 2007 we owned or operated 58 landfills which had 9707 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 17 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see item 2 “properties” 

most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills however no assurances can be made that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

recycling facilities and other services we have 33 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators 

 

we provided remediation and other heavy construction services primarily through our subsidiary located in missouri we sold this subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2005 because it did not complement our core business strategy 

 

our texasbased compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and other waste was processed packaged and sold as various products was sold during the fourth quarter of 2007 because it did not complement our core business strategy 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

 

most of our marketing activity is local in nature however we also provide a corporate accounts program in response to the needs of some of our customers 

 

we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we often rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publicly owned companies including waste management inc and allied waste industries inc several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies and thousands of small privately owned companies some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that 

maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract our ability to increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by the pricing policies of our competitors this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills this may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity or affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be recycled 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions or impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations 

 

1 the solid waste disposal act as amended including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and its implementing regulations establish a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and require states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to submit to the us epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 

 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

2 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but can also be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 “substances” characterized by the us epa as “hazardous” many of which may be found in common household waste 

 

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so in addition the us epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

liability under cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous waste it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of thousands of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if our landfills have never knowingly received hazardous waste as such it is possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or “released” at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

3 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under this act require a permit for certain construction activities and discharges from industrial 

operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under this act or the safe drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills furthermore development which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development commencing and certain mitigation requirements may be required by the permitting agencies 

 

4 the clean air act as amended the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the us epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 

 

5 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

 

state regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively 

 

in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these permits and approvals may be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states have enacted or promulgated or are considering 

enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has considered passing legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect our operations 

 

we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have thirdparty environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in scope or amount in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for workers’ compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills environmental remediation environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility 

requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 13000 fulltime employees approximately 3300 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 

 

compensation 

 

we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with the company’s overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based on free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these goals agree with the overall goals of the company incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our company’s overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our company’s short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

risk factors 

 

this annual report on form 10k includes “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including in particular certain statements about our plans strategies and prospects although we believe that our plans intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that such plans intentions or expectations will be achieved important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements include those set forth in this risk factors section all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires otherwise all references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” include republic services inc and its subsidiaries 

 

if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete effectively 

 

we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do we also compete with municipalities 

that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or “tipping” fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 

 

as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time 

 

we may be unable to obtain future increases in the prices for our services 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services in addition we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs and to improve our operating margins from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share general economic or market specific conditions may also limit our ability to raise prices as a result of these factors we may be unable to offset increases in costs and improve our operating margins through price increases we may also lose volume to lowercost competitors 

 

economic conditions could adversely affect our business operations and internal growth 

 

previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing sector and the residential and nonresidential construction industries landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity have also been impacted a slowdown in the economy in any of the markets we service could adversely affect volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal operations 

 

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business 

 

our operations are dependent on fuel which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis direct fuel costs include the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products used to operate our fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which include fuel surcharges from vendors increases in construction and excavation costs and increases in the costs of other petroleumbased products such as synthetic landfill liners during 2007 2006 and 2005 we experienced significant increases in the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products a portion of these increases was passed on to our customers however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers due to a number of factors including political instability in some oilproducing countries fuel prices may continue to fluctuate significantly in 2008 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent on our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund our internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common stock pay dividends minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the amount of our dividends 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time we cannot assure you that 

 

  

additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy may require spending significant amounts of capital if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements or prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth and impact our financial results 

 

we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such 

investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or the loss of a significant permit or license due to modification nonrenewal or revocation by the issuing agency could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or growth prospects see item 3 “legal proceedings” for further information 

 

regulatory approval to operate develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may be delayed or denied 

 

our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens’ groups and local politicians sometimes challenge our operations and these projects responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and operating and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities and operating and expanding existing facilities 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation deferred taxes uncertain tax positions and selfinsurance 

 

we cannot assure you that our liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

changes in insurance markets may impact our financial results 

 

due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

we depend on key personnel 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

 

seasonal changes or severe weather may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

on march 26 2007 republic services of ohio ii llc an ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of our company was issued final findings and orders from the ohio environmental protection agency the fos relate to environmental conditions attributed to a chemical reaction resulting from the disposal of certain aluminum production waste at the countywide recycling and disposal facility in east sparta ohio the fos and certain other remedial actions republicohio has agreed with the oepa to undertake to address the environmental conditions include without limitation the following actions a prohibiting leachate recirculation b refraining from the disposal of solid waste in certain portions of the site c updating engineering plans and specifications and providing further information regarding the integrity of various engineered components at the site d performing additional data collection e taking additional measures to address emissions f expanding the gas collection and control system g installing a “fire” break h removing liquids from gas extraction wells and i submitting a plan to the oepa to suppress the chemical reaction and following approval by the oepa implementing such plan we also paid approximately 7 million in sanctions to comply with the fos currently republicohio is performing certain interim remedial actions required by the oepa but the oepa has not approved republicohio’s plan to suppress the chemical reaction 

 

republicohio has also received a request from the us epa to cooperate and address certain environmental conditions at countywide republicohio has indicated its willingness to cooperate with the us epa on these issues republicohio is in the process of or has already substantially completed the activities identified in the us epa’s letter 

 

we learned that the commissioner of the stark county health department recommended that the health board suspend countywide’s 2007 annual operating license we also have learned that the commissioner intends to recommend that the health board deny countywide’s pending license application for 2008 republicohio obtained a preliminary injunction prohibiting the health board from suspending its 2007 operating license and has also obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting the health board from denying its 2008 operating license application 

 

we believe that we have diligently performed all actions required under the fos and that countywide does not pose a threat to the environment in addition there are indications that the reaction is beginning to subside as such we believe that we satisfy the rules and regulations that govern the operating license at countywide we disagree with the commissioner’s recommendation and will pursue all legal remedies available regarding licensing of the facility 

 

if we are not successful with such legal and administrative remedies we will be required to close countywide and record a noncash charge of approximately 90 million for asset impairment and a charge of approximately 10 million for acceleration of future capping closure and postclosure activities in addition we would forego future cash flows expected to be generated by countywide and a portion of the cash flows from our cleveland and akron marketplaces the annual projected future net cash flows are estimated to be approximately 16 million 

 

we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the fos other required remedial actions and if necessary any costs related to the closing of countywide 

 

we are and will continue to be involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business we can give you no assurance regarding the outcome of these proceedings or the effect their outcomes may have or that our insurance coverages or reserves are adequate a significant judgment against our company the loss of significant permits or licenses or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations cash flows or prospects 

 

governmental agencies have previously assessed and we have paid fines and penalties related primarily to environmental matters at our landfill operations as of december 31 2007 we were involved in several matters in which we believe there is a reasonable possibility that sanctions could exceed 100000 these matters involve allegations that we violated various federal and state regulations we do not believe that any of these matters will either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations cash flows or prospects

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview of our business 

 

we are a leading provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states we provide solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 136 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 94 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal recycling compost mulch and soil operations 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 58 and 56 respectively of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards 

of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is shown in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 23 

 

our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments from 2005 to 2007 revenue increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

  

operating margins in the eastern region decreased from 162 to 115 primarily because of a 446 million charge to operating expenses and a 15 million charge to selling general and administrative expenses associated with environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility in east sparta ohio excluding these expenses operating margins increased from 162 in 2006 to 194 in 2007 primarily due to higher revenue lower disposal costs and lower truck and equipment maintenance costs 

 

  

operating margins in our central region increased due to higher revenue lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with sfas 143 this increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and landfill operating costs 

 

  

operating margins in our southern region increased primarily due to higher revenue lower disposal costs due to drier weather lower truck and equipment maintenance costs and lower labor costs 

 

  

the increase in operating margins in our southwestern region is primarily due to higher revenue and lower selling general and administrative costs this increase in operating margins was partially offset by higher disposal and truck maintenance costs 

 

  

operating margins in our western region decreased because of an 81 million increase in landfill operating costs and a 52 million increase in sfas 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california excluding these expenses operating margins increased from 233 in 2006 to 240 in 2007 primarily due to higher revenue and an increase in the price of commodities 

 

  

2006 compared to 2005  

 

  

2007 financial objectives 

 

in february 2007 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these objectives included the following 

 

 25 

  

  

2007 business performance 

 

during 2007 we met or exceeded our financial objectives 

 

during 2007 we generated free cash flow of 3749 million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of 6613 million less purchases of property and equipment of 2925 million plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of 61 million 

 

in july 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2500 million of our company stock during 2007 we used our free cash flow to repurchase 111 million shares of our common stock or 57 of our outstanding shares for 3628 million also during the third quarter of 2007 our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 17 per share 

 

during 2007 we generated diluted earnings per share of 151 excluding pretax charges of 549 million 338 million or 018 per diluted share net of tax related to our countywide and contra costa county facilities and a pretax gain of 125 million 50 million or 003 per diluted share net of tax related to the sale of our compost mulch and soil business in texas our diluted earnings per share would have been 166 

 

our internal growth from core operations for 2007 excluding commodities divestitures taxes and noncore operations was 31 with 46 from price increases offset by a 15 decline in volume during 2007 our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broadbased pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003 the broadbased price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel costs during 2007 we experienced lower industrial collection and landfill volumes primarily resulting from the slowdown in residential construction 

 

excluding the 549 million of charges we recorded during 2007 related to our countywide and contra costa county facilities our operating margins increased by 17 from 169 in 2006 to 186 in 2007 during 2007 improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and insurance costs 

 

2008 financial objectives 

 

our financial objectives for 2008 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2007 specific guidance is as follows

2008 business initiatives 

 

our business initiatives for 2008 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2008 are as follows 

 

  

we currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and use a return on investment pricing model this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 

 

we use a customer relationship management system this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts during 2008 we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 

 

 27 

  

one of our most significant systems is our enterprisewide general ledger package which includes lawson general ledger software and lawson fixed asset software 

 

during december 2006 we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson enterprisewide human resources software this software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software it also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employeerelated initiatives such as training 

 

all of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions in addition all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale florida this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan

critical accounting policies judgments and disclosures 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain

business combinations 

 

we make decisions to acquire invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

 

we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was 44 million 49 million and 267 million respectively in addition during 2005 we entered into a 539 million capital lease related to a landfill 

 

in november 2007 we divested of our texasbased compost mulch and soil business and received proceeds of 365 million a gain of 125 million was recorded in 2007 on this divestiture in 2005 we divested of our operations in western new york and received proceeds of 291 million a gain of 33 million was recorded in 

2005 on the divestiture in addition in 2005 we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of 12 million a loss of 20 million was recorded in 2005 on the divestiture 

 

cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill for 2007 acquisitions totaled 10 million as of december 31 2007 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15557 million 

 

goodwill for 2006 acquisitions totaled 10 million as of december 31 2006 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15629 million 

 

goodwill for 2005 acquisitions totaled 166 million as of december 31 2005 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15638 million 579 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions including the landfill capital lease and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace during 2005 

 

when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired which are primarily for final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill purchase price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

our net income was 2902 million for the year ended december 31 2007 or 151 per diluted share as compared to 2796 million or 139 per diluted share in 2006 and 2537 million or 120 per diluted share in 2005 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded pretax charges of 453 million 279 million or 15 per diluted share net of tax related to estimated costs that we believe are required to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency in response to environmental conditions at our countywide recycling and disposal facility in east sparta ohio and to undertake certain other remedial actions we have agreed with the oepa to perform including without limitation installing a “fire” break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells while we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the fos and the additional remedial actions we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of 96 million 59 million or 03 per diluted share net of tax associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control 

 

the charges for our countywide and contra costa county facilities affected our consolidated statements of income as follows 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 48 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a 51 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits for the years 1998 through 2000 

 

we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” effective january 1 2006 using the modified prospective transition method as a result of adopting sfas 123r we recorded 63 million and 55 million of incremental equitybased compensation expense during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively in accordance with the modified prospective transition method our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of adopting sfas 123r see note 8 employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

the following table summarizes our operating costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

revenue revenue was 31762 million 30706 million and 28639 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively revenue increased by 1056 million or 34 from 2006 to 2007 revenue increased by 2067 million or 72 from 2005 to 2006 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

  

  

cost of operations cost of operations was 19973 million 19244 million and 18039 million or as a percentage of revenue 629 627 and 630 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily a result of the 410 million of charges we have recorded in cost of operations related to estimated costs to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency and to undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility and the 81 million charge we recorded related to an increase in leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california the increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

a description of our cost categories is as follows 

 

  

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 2990 million 2890 million and 2717 million or as a percentage of revenue 94 94 and 95 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is partially due to 33 million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under sfas 143 in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred approximately 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility depreciation expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program the slight decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to lower landfill amortization and depletion expense during 2006 

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts covenants not to compete and customer relationships expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 65 million 70 million and 71 million or as a percentage of revenue 2 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

accretion expense accretion expense was 171 million 157 million and 145 million or as a percentage of revenue 5 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increases in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to increases in asset retirement obligations 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 3203 million 3150 million and 2895 million or as a percentage of revenue 101 103 and 101 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to the expansion of our business the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and a 43 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience 

 

the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas 123r additional costs associated with our 401k plan resulting from an increase in the employer’s matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we incurred 63 million and 55 million respectively of incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas 123r 

 

we believe that selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 will be approximately 100 to 105 of revenue 

 

operating income operating income was 5360 million 5195 million and 4772 million or as a percentage of revenue 169 169 and 167 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

interest expense we incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 948 million 958 million and 810 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to an increase in debt balances and an increase in interest rates on our floatingrate debt 

 

capitalized interest was 30 million 27 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

interest income and other income expense net interest income and other income net of other expense was 269 million 200 million and 130 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to a 125 million gain related to the sale of our compost mulch and soil business in texas partially offset by lower interest income on cash and restricted cash balances the increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates 

 

income taxes our provision for income taxes was 1779 million 1641 million and 1555 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our effective income tax rate was 380 370 and 380 for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net tax benefit of 48 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of internal revenue service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a 51 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective 

completion of internal revenue service audits for the years 1998 through 2000 we believe that our effective income tax rate for 2008 will be approximately 385 

 

landfill and environmental matters 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

 

at december 31 2004 127 of our total available airspace or 2222 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills at december 31 2007 111 of our total available airspace or 1920 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills between 

december 31 2004 and december 31 2007 we received permits for five of our probable expansions which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

during 2007 total available airspace increased by a net 75 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken changes in engineering estimates and permits granted partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 total available airspace was increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in texas which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in texas changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility during 2006 total available airspace decreased by 336 million cubic yards due to airspace consumption partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates during 2005 total available airspace increased by 36 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken the acquisition of a landfill permits granted and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by airspace consumed 

 

as of december 31 2007 we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 17 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2007 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 15 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 3 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

as of december 31 2007 eleven of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these eleven landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 27 years probable expansion airspace represents 111 of our total available airspace we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of december 31 2007 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 2777 million the current portion of these costs of 326 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion of these costs of 2451 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

 

remediation and other charges for landfill matters 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded pretax charges of 453 million related to estimated costs to comply with final findings and orders issued by the ohio environmental protection agency and to 

undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility we have complied with and will continue to comply with the fos we also recorded 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the oepa’s fos while we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the fos and the additional remedial actions we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries 

 

also during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a charge of 96 million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in contra costa county california these additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the california department of toxic substance control 

 

we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate 

 

investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

the increase in depletion amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is partially due to an increase of 33 million in landfill amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations at our landfills this increase is also partially due to 33 million of additional depletion and amortization expense we have recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our countywide facility 

 

during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our weightedaverage compaction rate was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

 

as of december 31 2007 we expect to spend an estimated additional 17 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 26 billion or 150 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

 

financial condition 

 

at december 31 2007 we had 218 million of cash and cash equivalents we also had 1650 million of restricted cash deposits including 714 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 

 

in june 2005 we entered into a 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which was scheduled to expire in 2010 this facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated 7500 million in april 

2007 we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility to 10 billion and extended the term to 2012 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions stock repurchases dividends and other requirements as of december 31 2007 we had 5386 million available under our credit facility 

 

in may 1999 we sold 3750 million of unsecured notes in the public market these notes bear interest at 7125 per annum and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and november the notes were offered at a discount of 5 million in march 2005 we exchanged 2757 million of our outstanding 7125 notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035 the new notes bear interest at 6086 we paid a premium of 276 million related to the exchange this premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method 

 

in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 675 and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million 

 

in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of 2100 million and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of 675 our swap agreements mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2007 we had 7319 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which 585 million were obtained during fiscal 2007 borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 325 to 563 at december 31 2007 and have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2037 as of december 31 2007 we had 714 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

 

in march 2005 we entered into a 539 million capital lease related to a landfill 

 

we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary 

selected balance sheet accounts 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities and accrued selfinsurance during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 was 1 3 and 2 respectively the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable periods presented is due to an adjustment we recorded in 2007 of 43 million as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience as of december 31 2007 accounts receivable were 2982 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 147 million resulting in days sales outstanding of 34 or 20 days net of deferred revenue at december 31 2007 our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled 195 million or 62 of gross receivables outstanding 

 

our expense for selfinsurance which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees as a percentage of revenue for 2007 2006 and 2005 was 59 54 and 56 respectively the increase in selfinsurance expense for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims the decrease in selfinsurance expense for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to favorable claims development we believe that during 2008 our selfinsurance expense will be in the range of 55 to 60 of revenue

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 are discussed below 

 

cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 6613 million 5112 million and 7478 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments made for accounts payable additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 we paid approximately 830 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005 this tax payment had been deferred as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition to the above we have unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 of 232 million of which we expect to settle approximately 6 million within the following twelve months due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the remainder of the unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements 

 

we also have letters of credit totaling 6691 million outstanding at december 31 2007 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have or engage in any offbalance sheet arrangements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the table below provides information about our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt all items described below are nontrading 

 

 

 

the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates 

 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2007 was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by an 830 million federal tax payment that had been deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2005 was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a 1134 million federal tax payment that was deferred during february 2006 we paid 830 million of these deferred payments 

 

purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property 

and equipment received during the period for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is as follows in millions 

 

 

 

the adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow 

 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders paying cash dividends maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 will be effective beginning january 1 2008 we do not believe that the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas 159 will be effective for our company beginning january 1 2008 at the effective date a company may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date the company would report the initial effect of any remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected would be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings we do not believe that sfas 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to us

company overview 

 

we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 135 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 93 transfer stations 59 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities 

 

as of december 31 2006 our operations were organized into five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating segments 

 

we had revenue of 30706 million and 28639 million and operating income of 5195 million and 4772 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2067 million or 72 increase in revenue and the 423 million or 89 increase in operating income from 2005 to 2006 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below 

 

our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including california florida georgia nevada north carolina south carolina and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below 

 

we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

industry overview 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 47 billion of which approximately 54 is generated by publicly owned waste companies 19 is generated by privately held waste companies and 27 is generated by municipal and other local governmental authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the publicly owned companies’ total revenue however according to industry data the nonhazardous waste industry in the united states remains highly fragmented as privately held companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 46 of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new households and business formation 

 

the solid waste industry experienced a period of rapid consolidation in the late 1990s during that time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions however acquisitions in the industry have slowed considerably since late 1999 despite this we believe that the opportunity to grow through acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than has been previously experienced as a result of the following factors 

 

subtitle d regulation subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 as currently in effect and similar state regulations have significantly increased the amount of capital technical expertise operating costs and financial assurance obligations required to own and operate a landfill and other solid waste facilities many of the smaller participants in our industry have found these costs difficult if not impossible to bear large publicly owned companies like our company have greater access to and a lower cost of the capital necessary to finance such increased capital expenditures and costs relative to many of the privately owned companies in the industry additionally the required permits for landfill development expansion and 

construction have become more difficult timeconsuming and costly to acquire consequently many smaller independent operators have decided to either close their operations or sell them to larger operators that have greater access to capital 

 

integration of solid waste businesses by being able to control the waste stream in a market through the collection transfer and disposal process integrated solid waste companies gain a further competitive advantage over nonintegrated operators the ability of the integrated companies to both collect and dispose of solid waste coupled with access to significant capital resources necessary for acquisitions has created an environment in which large publicly owned integrated companies can operate more cost effectively and competitively than nonintegrated operators 

 

municipal privatization the trend toward consolidation in the solid waste services industry is further supported by the gradual privatization of municiple waste disposal operations privatization of municipal waste operations is often an attractive alternative to funding the changes required by subtitle d 

 

these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous privately held companies in the industry have contributed to the overall consolidation trend in the solid waste industry 

 

financial strategy 

 

key components of our financial strategy include our ability to generate free cash flow and sustain or improve our return on invested capital our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct monthly field operating reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing free cash flow and maintaining and improving returns on invested capital 

 

the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize shareholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following 

 

  

volume growth growth through increases in our customer base and services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our business this includes not only expanding landfill and transfer capacity and investing in trucks and containers but also includes investing in information tools and training needed to ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional areas of our business 

 

price growth growth through price increases is the most costeffective means of expanding our business price increases also allow us to recover historical and current year increases in operating costs which ultimately enhances our operating margins 

  

another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure favorable financing this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to readily access capital markets 

 

for certain risks related to our financial strategy see item 1a “risk factors” 

 

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance shareholder value our operating strategy for accomplishing this goal includes the following 

 

  

for certain risks related to our operating strategy see item 1a “risk factors” 

 

  

james e o’connor who has served as our chief executive officer since december 1998 also became our chairman in january 2003 he worked at waste management inc from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr o’connor has over 32 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

michael j cordesman who has served as our chief operating officer since march 2002 and also as our president since february 2003 has over 26 years of experience in the solid waste industry he joined us in june 2001 as our eastern region vice president from 1999 to 2001 mr cordesman served as vice president of the central region for superior services inc from 1980 to 1999 he served in various positions with waste management inc including vice president of the midatlantic region from 1992 to 1999 

 

the other corporate officers with responsibility for our operations have an average of over 25 years of management experience in the solid waste industry our five regional vice presidents and our 23 area presidents have an average of 24 years of experience in the industry 

 

in addition harris w hudson who has served as our vice chairman since our initial public offering in 1998 has over 42 years of experience in the solid waste industry including 11 years with waste management inc and 19 years with private waste collection companies

growth strategy 

 

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal growth and acquisitions for certain risks related to our growth strategy see item 1a “risk factors” 

 

  

pricing activities we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs during 2006 we continued to secure broadbased price increases across all lines of our business to offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel price increases will remain a major component of our overall future operating strategy 

 

longterm contracts we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste in highgrowth markets these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets for example we have secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in highgrowth markets such as los angeles orange and contra costa counties in california las vegas nevada arlington texas and many areas of florida we believe that this positions our company to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate in addition we believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growth markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 

 

sales and marketing activities we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable our company to capitalize on our leading position in many of the markets in which we operate we currently have approximately 500 sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial industrial municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in addition we utilize a contact management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts 

 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations andor landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available 

 

  

  

we also seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

for certain risks involved with our acquisition growth strategy see item 1a “risk factors — we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy” “— we may be unable to manage our growth effectively” and “— businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities” 

 

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 21 states through 135 collection companies in 2006 755 of our revenue was derived from collection services within the collection line of business 317 of our revenue is from services provided to municipal and residential customers 371 is from services provided to commercial customers and 312 is from services provided to industrial and other customers 

 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance 

to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by considerations such as the following 

 

  

we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer our construction services are provided to the commercial construction and the home building sectors we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

transfer and disposal services we own or operate 93 transfer stations we deposit waste at these transfer stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities as of december 31 2006 we owned or operated 59 landfills which had 9707 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 17 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully obtain expansion permits at our sites some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see item 2 “properties” 

 

most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills although no assurances can be made that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

other services we have 33 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing thirdparty recycling facilities thereby minimizing our recycling investment 

 

we provided remediation and other heavy construction services primarily through our subsidiary located in missouri we sold this subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2005 because it did not complement our core business strategy 

 

we also have a texasbased compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

 

most of our marketing activity is local in nature however we also provide a corporate accounts program in response to the needs of some of our customers 

 

we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publicly owned companies including waste management inc and allied waste industries inc several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies and thousands of small privately owned companies some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills this may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be recycled 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in 

certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations 

 

1 the solid waste disposal act as amended including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and its implementing regulations establish a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and require states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

 

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to submit to the us epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d our failure to comply with the environmental requirements of federal state and local authorities at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit 

 

all of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

2 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but can also be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 “substances” characterized by the us epa as “hazardous” many of which may be found in common household waste 

 

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so in addition the us epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

liability under cercla is not dependent on the intentional disposal of hazardous waste it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of thousands of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if our landfills have never knowingly received hazardous waste as such it is possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or “released” at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

3 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under this act require a permit for certain construction activities and discharges from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly owned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under this act or the safe drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills furthermore development which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development commencing and certain mitigation requirements may be required by the permitting agencies 

 

4 the clean air act as amended the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the us epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas 

 

5 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

 

state regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste 

newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively 

 

in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these permits and approvals may be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and to operate in compliance with are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification nonrenewal and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has considered passing legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect our operations 

 

we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs which include landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of 

regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have thirdparty environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability worker’s compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for worker’s compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental permits and certain business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 13000 fulltime employees approximately 3500 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 

 

compensation 

 

we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with the company’s overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based on free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these goals agree with the overall goals of the company incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our company’s overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our company’s short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

risk factors 

 

this annual report on form 10k includes “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including in particular certain statements about our plans strategies and prospects although we believe that our plans intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that such plans intentions or expectations will be achieved important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements include those set forth in this risk factors section all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires otherwise all references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” include republic services inc and its subsidiaries 

 

if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete effectively 

 

we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment 

 

we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win competitively bid municipal contracts 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or “tipping” fees geographic location and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 

 

as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time 

 

economic conditions could adversely affect our business operations and internal growth 

 

previous economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing sector and the residential and nonresidential construction industries landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity have also been impacted a slowdown in the economy in any of the markets we service could adversely affect volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal operations 

 

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business 

 

our operations are dependent on fuel which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis direct fuel costs include the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products used to operate our fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which include fuel surcharges from vendors 

increased construction and excavation costs and increases in the costs of other petroleumbased products such as synthetic landfill liners during 2006 2005 and 2004 we experienced significant increases in the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products a portion of these increases was passed on to our customers however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers due to a number of factors including political instability in oilproducing countries fuel prices may continue to fluctuate significantly in 2007 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund our internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common stock pay dividends minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance shareholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the amount of our dividends 

 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time we cannot assure you that 

 

  

additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy may require spending significant amounts of capital if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities 

as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

our financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation deferred taxes and selfinsurance 

 

we cannot assure you that our liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

changes in insurance markets may impact our financial results 

 

due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

we depend on key personnel 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

 

compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth and impact our financial results 

 

we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or our loss of significant permits or licenses due to modification nonrenewal or revocation by the issuing agency could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or growth prospects 

 

regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may be delayed or denied 

 

our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens’ groups and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 

 

seasonal changes or severe weather may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

the outcome of audits by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our company 

 

the internal revenue service is auditing our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 no assurance can be given with respect to the outcome of the audits for these periods or the effect they may have on us or that our reserves with respect thereto are adequate a significant assessment against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview of our business 

 

we are a leading provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states we provide solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 135 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 93 transfer stations 59 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal recycling compost mulch and soil operations 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions 

 

 

 

our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs it also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2006 and 2005 approximately 56 and 57 respectively of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of 

available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is shown in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 24 

 

our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments from 2004 to 2006 operating income increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy 

 

  

  

  

 25 

  

  

2006 financial objectives 

 

in january 2006 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these objectives included the following 

 

  

2006 business performance 

 

during 2006 we exceeded all of our financial objectives 

 

our internal growth from core operations for 2006 was 72 with 48 from price increases and 24 from volume growth during 2006 our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broadbased pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003 the broadbased price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business including our residential collection business during 2006 our core volume growth was negatively impacted by hurricane cleanup efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005 however our geographic mix of business which is concentrated in high growth markets positively impacted our operating results as a result during 2006 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 

 

our operating margins increased by 20 from 167 in 2005 to 169 in 2006 during 2006 improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and landfill operating costs 

 

during 2006 we generated free cash flow of 2030 million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of 5221 million less purchases of property and equipment of 3376 million plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of 185 million our free cash flow was negatively impacted by an 830 million federal 

tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina excluding this federal tax payment our free cash flow for 2006 would have been 2860 million which exceeded our original guidance 

 

during 2006 we used our free cash flow to repurchase 122 million shares of our common stock or approximately 9 of our outstanding shares for 4920 million also during the third quarter of 2006 our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 16 per share 

 

during 2006 we generated diluted earnings per share of 207 which significantly exceeded our initial objective 

 

2007 financial objectives 

 

our financial objectives for 2007 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2006 specific guidance is as follows 

 

  

2007 business initiatives 

 

our business initiatives for 2007 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2007 are as follows 

 

 27 

  

we currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and have instituted a return on investment pricing model this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 

 

we use a customer relationship management system this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts during 2007 we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 

 

  

one of our most significant systems is our enterprisewide general ledger package we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 

 

during december 2006 we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson enterprisewide human resource software this software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software it also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employeerelated initiatives such as training 

 

all of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions in addition all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale florida this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan

goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled 132 million as of december 31 2004 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15627 million 282 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

our net income was 2796 million for the year ended december 31 2006 or 207 per diluted share as compared to 2537 million or 175 per diluted share in 2005 and 2379 million or 153 per diluted share in 2004 

 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded a 51 million net income tax benefit in our provision for income taxes this benefit relates to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of federal tax audits for the years 1998 through 2000

the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

revenue revenue was 30706 million 28639 million and 27081 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively revenue increased by 2067 million or 72 from 2005 to 2006 revenue increased by 1558 million or 58 from 2004 to 2005 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

 

  

  

cost of operations cost of operations was 19244 million 18039 million and 17144 million or as a percentage of revenue 627 630 and 633 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth 

 

the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

a description of our cost categories is as follows 

 

  

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 2890 million 2717 million and 2524 million or as a percentage of revenue 94 95 and 93 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars for the periods presented is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions the slight decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to lower depletion expense during 2006 the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 versus the 

comparable 2004 period is due to an increase in depreciation expense associated with vehicles and equipment acquired in 2005 

 

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts covenants not to compete and customer relationships expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 70 million 71 million and 70 million or as a percentage of revenue 2 2 and 3 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

accretion expense accretion expense was 157 million 145 million and 137 million or as a percentage of revenue 5 for each of the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 3150 million 2895 million and 2683 million or as a percentage of revenue 103 101 and 99 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increases in aggregate dollars for the periods presented are primarily a result of the expansion of our business the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas 123r additional costs associated with our 401k plan resulting from an increase in the employer’s matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 55 million of incremental costs associated with our adoption of sfas 123r these increases in costs during the year ended december 31 2006 were partially offset by an increase in revenue the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to approximately 30 million of costs associated with the exchange of unsecured notes during 2005 and a 21 million noncash charge incurred during 2005 related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options 

 

we believe that selling general and administrative expenses of approximately 10 of revenue are appropriate for 2007 given our business platform 

 

operating income operating income was 5195 million 4772 million and 4523 million or as a percentage of revenue 169 167 and 167 for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

interest expense we incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 958 million 810 million and 767 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to an increase in debt balances and an increase in interest rates on our floatingrate debt the increase from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates on our floatingrate debt an increase in debt balances and fees associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in 2005 

 

capitalized interest was 27 million 20 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

interest income and other income expense net interest income and other income net of other expense was 200 million 130 million and 81 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars during the years presented is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates in may 2004 we used primarily marketable securities balances to repay 2250 million of public notes 

 

income taxes our provision for income taxes was 1641 million 1555 million and 1458 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our effective income tax rate was 370 for the year ended december 31 2006 and 380 for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a 51 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of federal tax audits for the years 1998 through 2000 

 

landfill and environmental matters 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

 

at december 31 2003 152 of our total available airspace or 2687 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at fifteen of our landfills at december 31 2006 72 of our total available airspace or 1246 million cubic yards consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills this decrease in probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

during 2006 total available airspace decreased by 336 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates during 2005 total available airspace increased by 36 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken the acquisition of a 

landfill permits granted and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by airspace consumed during 2004 total available airspace decreased by 155 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill 

 

as of december 31 2006 we owned or operated 59 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 17 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2006 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 16 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 1 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet all of our expansion criteria see note 3 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

as of december 31 2006 eight of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these eight landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 29 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 27 years 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

sites with expansion airspace include one landfill with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of december 31 2006 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 2576 million the current portion of these costs of 290 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion of these costs of 2286 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

 

investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 our weightedaverage compaction rate was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard based on our threeyear historical moving average our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste 

 

as of december 31 2006 we expect to spend an estimated additional 16 billion on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 25 billion or 143 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

 

we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we charged 85 million 1 million and 17 million respectively to income for remediation costs during 2006 we incurred costs at one of our active landfills associated with the remediation of waste that was deposited during the mid1990s 

 

financial condition 

 

at december 31 2006 we had 291 million of cash and cash equivalents we also had 1533 million of restricted cash deposits including 656 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities 

 

in june 2005 we entered into a 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in 2010 this facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated 7500 million borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other requirements as of december 31 2006 we had 2665 million available under our credit facility 

 

in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public market 2250 million of these notes bore interest at 6625 per annum and matured in may 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7125 per annum and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively in march 2005 we exchanged 2757 million of our outstanding 7125 notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035 the new notes bear interest at 6086 we paid a premium of 276 million related to the exchange this premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method 

 

in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 675 and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million 

 

in march 2005 we entered into a 539 million capital lease related to a landfill 

 

in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions the swap agreements have total notional values of 2250 million and 2100 million respectively and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor and receive interest at fixed rates of 6625 and 675 respectively swap agreements with a notional value of 2250 million matured in may 2004 and agreements with a notional value of 2100 million mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2006 we had 6742 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which 300 million were obtained during fiscal 2006 borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 325 to 563 at december 31 2006 and have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2037 as of december 31 2006 we had 656 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

 

we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary 

 

selected balance sheet accounts 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities and accrued selfinsurance during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2006 2005 and 2004 was 3 2 and 3 respectively as of december 31 2006 accounts receivable were 2938 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 188 million resulting in days sales outstanding of 34 or 22 days net of deferred revenue in addition at december 31 2006 our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled 201 million or 64 of gross receivables outstanding 

 

our expense for selfinsurance which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees as a percentage of revenue for 2006 2005 and 2004 was 54 56 and 61 respectively the decrease in selfinsurance expense during the years presented is due to favorable claims development we believe that during 2007 our selfinsurance expense will be in the range of 50 to 55 of revenue

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are discussed below 

 

cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 5221 million 7675 million and 6663 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments for accounts payable additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 we paid approximately 830 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005 this tax payment had been deferred as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 

 

in december 2003 we received written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization depletion and final capping closure and postclosure expense for tax purposes as a result of this change we recorded a tax receivable of approximately 480 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended december 31 2004 also during the year ended december 31 2004 we collected a 230 million note receivable associated with a divested business

our company has received investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2006 our senior debt was rated bbb by standard  poor’s bbb by fitch and baa2 by moody’s 

 

fuel hedges 

 

during september 2006 we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 133” the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases these option agreements commenced on october 2 2006 and settle each month in equal notional amounts of 500000 gallons through december 31 2007 in accordance with sfas 133 the effective portion of the change in fair value as of december 31 2006 net of tax has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

 

during october 2005 we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the option agreements commenced on january 1 2006 and settled each month in equal notional amounts through december 31 2006 in accordance with sfas 133 the effective portion of the change in fair value as of december 31 2005 net of tax has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

 

during march 2005 we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases the option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts through december 31 2005 the ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and was included in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 in millions 

 

 

 

  

in addition to the above we have letters of credit totaling 6384 million outstanding at december 31 2006 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have or engage in any offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the table below provides information about our marketsensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt all items described below are nontrading 

 

 

 

the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximates current market rates 

 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2006 was negatively affected by an 830 million federal tax payment that had been deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2005 was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a 1134 million federal tax payment that was deferred during february 2006 we paid 830 million of these deferred taxes 

 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in 

our customer base and services provided pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders paying cash dividends maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

seasonality and severe weather 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” the “interpretation” the interpretation applies to all tax positions within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and applies a “more likely than not” threshold for tax benefit recognition identifies a defined methodology for measuring benefits and increases the disclosure requirements for companies the interpretation is mandatory for years beginning after december 15 2006 accordingly we will adopt the interpretation effective january 1 2007 the cumulative effect of adopting the interpretation will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable we are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this new accounting standard we do not believe that the adoption of the interpretation will have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 will be effective for our company beginning january 1 2008 we are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of sfas 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements we do not believe that the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to our company

because of its inherent limitations our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

 

we under the supervision of and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief accounting officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control — integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the specified criteria 

 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

 

disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e as of the end of the period covered by this annual report based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter identified in connection with that evaluation that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

company overview 

 

we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 92 transfer stations 59 solid waste landfills and 32 recycling facilities 

 

as of december 31 2005 our operations were organized into five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas and each area contains multiple operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of operating segments 

 

we had revenue of 28639 million and 27081 million and operating income of 4772 million and 4523 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the 1558 million or 58 increase in revenue and the 249 million or 55 increase in operating income from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below 

 

our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including california florida georgia nevada north carolina south carolina and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate 

 

we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below 

 

we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 

 

industry overview 

 

based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 465 billion of which approximately 48 is generated by publiclyowned waste companies 23 is generated by privatelyheld waste companies and 29 is generated by municipal and other local governmental authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the publiclyowned companies’ total revenue however according to industry data the domestic nonhazardous waste industry remains highly fragmented as privatelyheld companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 52 of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation 

 

the solid waste industry experienced a period of rapid consolidation in the late 1990’s during that time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions however acquisitions in the industry have slowed considerably since late 1999 despite this we believe that the opportunity to grow through acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than experienced in previous years as a result of the following factors 

 

subtitle d regulation subtitle d of the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 as currently in effect and similar state regulations have significantly increased the amount of capital technical expertise operating costs and financial assurance obligations required to own and operate a landfill and other solid waste facilities many of the smaller participants in our industry have found these costs difficult if not impossible to bear large publiclyowned companies like our company have greater access to and a lower cost of the capital necessary to finance such increased capital expenditures and costs relative to many of the privatelyowned companies in the industry additionally the required permits for landfill development expansion or 

  construction have become more difficult timeconsuming and costly to acquire consequently many smaller independent operators have decided to either close their operations or sell them to larger operators that have greater access to capital 

 

integration of solid waste businesses by being able to control the waste stream in a market through the collection transfer and disposal process integrated solid waste companies gain a further competitive advantage over nonintegrated operators the ability of the integrated companies to both collect and dispose of solid waste coupled with access to significant capital resources necessary for acquisitions has created an environment in which large publiclyowned integrated companies can operate more cost effectively and competitively than nonintegrated operators 

 

municipal privatization the trend toward consolidation in the solid waste services industry is further supported by the increasing tendency of a number of municipalities to privatize their waste disposal operations privatization of municipal waste operations is often an attractive alternative to funding the changes required by subtitle d 

 

these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous privatelyheld companies in the industry have contributed to the overall consolidation trend in the solid waste industry 

 

financial strategy 

 

a key component of our financial strategy is our ability to generate free cash flow our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows we believe that free cash flow is a driver of shareholder value and provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct monthly field operating reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing free cash flow 

 

the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

 

we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following 

 

 2 

    

  

another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure favorable longterm fixedrate financing that reduces our exposure to changing interest rates this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to readily access capital markets

operating strategy 

 

we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy to accomplish this goal is to

james e o’connor who has served as our chief executive officer since december 1998 also became our chairman in january 2003 he worked at waste management inc from 1972 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr o’connor has over 31 years of experience in the solid waste industry 

 

michael j cordesman who has served as our chief operating officer since march 2002 and also as our president since february 2003 has over 25 years of experience in the solid waste industry he joined us in june 2001 as our eastern region vice president from 1999 to 2001 mr cordesman served as vice president of the central region for superior services inc from 1980 to 1999 he served in various positions with waste management including vice president of the midatlantic region from 1992 to 1999 

 

the other corporate officers with responsibility for our operations have an average of over 24 years of management experience in the solid waste industry our five regional vice presidents and our 21 area presidents have an average of 24 years of experience in the industry 

 

in addition harris w hudson who has served as our vice chairman since our initial public offering has over 41 years of experience in the solid waste industry including 11 years with waste management and 19 years with private waste collection companies

growth strategy 

 

our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal growth and acquisitions for certain risks related to our growth strategy see “risk factors” 

 

  

pricing activities we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs during the fourth quarter of 2003 we implemented a broadbased pricing initiative across all lines of our business during 2004 and 2005 we secured further broadbased price increases to offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel price increases continue to be a major component of our overall operating strategy 

 

longterm contracts we seek to obtain longterm contracts for collecting solid waste in highgrowth markets these include exclusive franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the underlying population growth in these markets for example we have secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in highgrowth markets such as los angeles orange and contra costa counties in california las vegas nevada arlington texas and many areas of florida we believe that this positions our company to experience internal growth rates that are generally higher than our industry’s overall growth rate in addition we believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growth markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic conditions 

 

sales and marketing activities we seek to manage our sales and marketing activities to enable our company to capitalize on our leading positions in many of the markets in which we operate we currently have approximately 500 sales and marketing employees in the field who are compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial industrial municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in addition we utilize a contact management system that assists our sales people in tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts 

 

development activities we seek to identify opportunities to further our position as an integrated service provider in markets where we provide services for a portion of the waste stream where appropriate we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations andor landfills that would provide vertically integrated waste services or expand the service area for our existing disposal sites development projects while generally less capital intensive typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success we undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available

for certain risks involved with our acquisition growth strategy see “risk factors — we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy” “— we may be unable to manage our growth effectively” and “— businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities” 

 

acquire businesses positioning the company for growth in making acquisitions we principally target high quality businesses that will allow our company to be or provide our company favorable prospects of becoming a leading provider of integrated solid waste services in markets with favorable demographic growth generally we have acquired and will continue to seek to acquire solid waste collection transfer and disposal companies that 

 

  

once we have a base of operations in a particular market we focus on acquiring trucks and routes of smaller businesses that also operate in that market and surrounding markets which are typically referred to as “tuckin” acquisitions we seek to consolidate the operations of such tuckin businesses into our existing operations in that market we also seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 

 

acquire wellmanaged companies we also seek to acquire businesses that have experienced management teams that are willing to join the management of our company we generally seek to maintain continuity in management of larger acquired companies in order to capitalize on their local market knowledge community relations and name recognition and to instill their entrepreneurial drive at all levels of our operations by furnishing the local management of such acquired companies with our financial and marketing resources and technical expertise we believe that the acquired companies are better able to secure additional municipal franchises and other contracts 

 

privatize municipal operations and acquire divested operations we also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations transfer stations and landfills that municipalities and other governmental authorities are privatizing many municipalities are seeking to outsource or sell these types of solid waste operations as they lack the capital technical expertise andor operational resources necessary to comply with increasingly stringent regulatory standards andor to compete effectively with privatesector companies in addition we 

  have acquired and will continue to seek to acquire operations and facilities that are being divested by other publiclyowned waste companies 

 

operations 

 

our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

 

collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 21 states through 140 collection companies in 2005 747 of our revenue was derived from collection services consisting of 320 from services provided to municipal and residential customers 365 from services provided to commercial customers and 315 from services provided to industrial and other customers 

 

our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

 

in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by such considerations as 

 

  

we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

 

also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

 

transfer and disposal services we own or operate 92 transfer stations we deposit waste at these stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities as of december 31 2005 we owned or operated 59 landfills which had approximately 9518 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 18 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities and the ability to expand our sites successfully some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see “— properties” 

 

most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs 

  remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted as designed 

 

other services we have 32 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing thirdparty recycling facilities thereby minimizing our recycling investment 

 

we provided remediation and other heavy construction services primarily through our subsidiary located in missouri we sold this subsidiary during the fourth quarter of 2005 because it did not compliment our core business strategy during the ten months ended october 31 2005 this business generated revenue of 129 million and had an operating loss of 25 million 

 

we also have a texasbased compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

 

we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

 

most of our marketing activity is local in nature however we also provide a corporate accounts program in response to the needs of our customers 

 

we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate 

 

customers 

 

we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 100 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

competition 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

 

competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publiclyowned companies including waste management and allied waste industries several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenues and taxexempt financing 

  we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills this may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be recycled 

 

regulation 

 

our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor 

 

we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

 

federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations 

 

1 the solid waste disposal act as amended including the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and its implementing regulations establish a framework for regulating the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and require states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills 

 

subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria final capping closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to submit to the us epa a permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of subtitle d 

  all of our planned landfill expansions or new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these new regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities 

 

2 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla among other things provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of the site parties who were owners or operators of the site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substances to the site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site under the authority of cercla and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment liability under cercla is not dependent upon the existence or disposal of only “hazardous wastes” but can also be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 “substances” characterized by the us epa as “hazardous” many of which may be found in common household waste 

 

among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so in addition the us epa has established a national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup 

 

liability under cercla is not dependent upon the intentional disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances it can be founded upon the release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action of thousands of hazardous substances including very small quantities of such substances thus even if our landfills have never knowingly received hazardous waste as such it is possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or “released” at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability could have a material impact on our business and financial condition for a further discussion see “— liability insurance and bonding” 

 

3 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended this act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters of the united states point source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under this act require a permit for certain construction activities and discharges from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publiclyowned treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection programs under this act or the safe drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills furthermore development which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development commencing and certain mitigation requirements may be required by the permitting agencies 

 

4 the clean air act as amended the clean air act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the us epa promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste the regulations apply 

  whether the landfill is active or closed the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending upon calculated emission rates at the landfill many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas we do not expect that compliance with any new state regulations will have a material effect on us 

 

5 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended this act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities and operations 

 

state regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively 

 

in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these are difficult and timeconsuming to obtain are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

 

many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet in all material respects all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has considered passing legislation authorizing states and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation authorizing state and local governments to 

  restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect our operations 

 

we have established liabilities for landfill and environmental costs which includes landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our liabilities recorded for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our recorded liabilities will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — landfill and environmental matters” and “risk factors — compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth” 

 

liability insurance and bonding 

 

the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have thirdparty environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

 

we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability worker’s compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

our insurance programs for worker’s compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

 

in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental permits and certain business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

  employees 

 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 13000 fulltime employees approximately 3200 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 

 

compensation 

 

we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with the company’s overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based upon free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our company’s overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our company’s short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

risk factors 

 

this annual report on form 10k includes “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including in particular certain statements about our plans strategies and prospects although we believe that our plans intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that such plans intentions or expectations will be achieved important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements include those set forth in this risk factors section all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires otherwise all references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” include republic services inc and its subsidiaries 

 

if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete effectively 

 

we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment 

  we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

 

we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win competitively bid municipal contracts 

 

in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or “tipping” fees geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 

 

as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time 

 

economic conditions could adversely affect our business operations and internal growth 

 

in the past economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing sector and the nonresidential construction industry landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity were also impacted a slowdown in the economy in any of the markets we service could adversely affect volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal operations 

 

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business 

 

our operations are dependent upon fuel which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis direct fuel costs include the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products used to operate our fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which include fuel surcharges from vendors increased construction and excavation costs and increases in the costs of other petroleumbased products such as synthetic landfill liners during 2003 2004 and 2005 we experienced increases in the cost of fuel and other petroleumbased products a portion of these increases was passed on to our customers however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers due to political instability in oilproducing countries fuel prices may continue to increase significantly in 2006 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business 

 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

 

our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business fund our internal growth acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common stock pay dividends minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the amount of our dividends 

 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

 

our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings 

  economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time in short we cannot assure you that 

 

  

additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy may require spending significant amounts of capital if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

 

our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

 

in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

 

our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation deferred taxes and selfinsurance 

 

we cannot assure you that our liabilities recorded for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes to or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

 

changes in insurance markets may impact our financial results 

 

due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

  we depend on key personnel 

 

our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

 

compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth 

 

we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or our loss of significant permits or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

 

regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may be delayed or denied 

 

our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens’ groups and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 

 

seasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

the outcome of audits by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our company 

 

the internal revenue service is auditing our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2004 no assurance can be given with respect to the outcome of the audits for these periods or the effect they may have on us or that our reserves with respect thereto are adequate a significant assessment against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview of our business 

 

we are a leading provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states we provide solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 21 states we also own or operate 92 transfer stations 59 solid waste landfills and 32 recycling facilities 

 

we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal recycling compost mulch and soil operations 

 

the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 in millions 

 

 

 

our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

 

the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs we seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2005 and 2004 approximately 57 and 54 respectively of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 

 

our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and 

  synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

 

cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

 

summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is shown in the following table 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 23 

  our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments from 2004 to 2005 operating income increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy 

 

  

the increase in operating income from 2003 to 2004 in total and for each of our regions was partially due to a decrease in selfinsurance expense operating income increased in our eastern southern and western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy in the central region increased revenue was partially offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs related to the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors in the southwestern region revenue growth was impeded by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special waste contract during 2003 the increase in costs for corporate entities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the expansion of our business 

 

2005 financial objectives 

 

in january 2005 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these objectives included the following 

 

  

2005 business performance 

 

during 2005 we exceeded all of our financial objectives 

  our internal growth from core operations for 2005 was 61 with 38 from price increases and 23 from volume growth during 2005 our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broadbased pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003 we also secured broadbased price increases to offset various escalating capital and operating costs including fuel we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane cleanup efforts in addition our geographic mix of business which is concentrated in high growth markets positively impacted our operating results as a result during 2005 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 

 

our operating margins in 2005 remained consistent with those achieved during 2004 during 2005 significantly higher fuel costs were offset by improved pricing lower selfinsurance expense and continued focus on productivity improvements 

 

during 2005 we generated free cash flow of 4489 million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of 7675 million less purchases of property and equipment of 3287 million plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of 101 million which substantially exceeded our objective our free cash flow was positively impacted by a 1134 million federal tax payment that was deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures 

 

during 2005 we used our free cash flow to repurchase 163 million shares of our common stock or approximately 11 of our outstanding shares for 5584 million also during the third quarter of 2005 our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 14 per share 

 

during 2005 we generated diluted earnings per share of 175 which significantly exceeded our objective 

 

2006 financial objectives 

 

our financial objectives for 2006 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2005 specific guidance is as follows 

 

  

2006 business initiatives 

 

our business initiatives for 2006 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2006 are as follows 

 

 25 

    

  

we currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and have instituted a return on investment pricing model this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 

 

during 2001 we also implemented a customer relationship management system this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts during 2006 we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended 

 

  

one of our most significant systems is our enterprisewide general ledger package we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 

 

all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions in addition during 2001 all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale florida this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our 

  operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan 

 

during 2006 we will begin to develop an enterprisewide human resource information system this system will provide a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software it will also provide a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employeerelated initiatives such as training we expect to implement this new system in 2007

  critical accounting policies and disclosures 

 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain

business combinations 

 

we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

 

we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was 267 million 474 million and 515 million respectively in addition during 2005 we entered into a 539 million capital lease related to a landfill 

 

we divested of our operations in western new york during the three months ended march 31 2005 and received proceeds of 291 million a gain of 33 million was recorded on the divestiture in addition during the three months ended december 31 2005 we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of 12 million a loss of 20 million was recorded on the divestiture 

 

cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill for 2005 acquisitions totaled 166 million as of december 31 2005 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15638 million 

 

during 2005 579 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions including debt acquired and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace as of december 31 2005 we had 8007 million of landfill development costs net of accumulated depletion and amortization which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired which are primarily for final capping closure and postclosure obligations landfill purchase 

  price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 

 

goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately 132 million as of december 31 2004 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15627 million 282 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 

 

goodwill for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately 212 million as of december 31 2003 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15581 million 277 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 

 

consolidated results of operations

our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was 2537 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2379 million in 2004 and 2154 million in 2003 net income was 2537 million for year ended december 31 2005 or 175 per diluted share as compared to 2379 million or 153 per diluted share in 2004 and 1776 million or 110 per diluted share in 2003 net income for the year ended december 31 2003 includes an aftertax expense of 378 million net of an income tax benefit of 231 million or 23 per share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems see note 1 basis of presentation of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles 

 

the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 

  revenue revenue was 28639 million 27081 million and 25178 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively revenue increased by 1558 million or 58 from 2004 to 2005 revenue increased by 1903 million or 76 from 2003 to 2004 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 

 

 

  

  

cost of operations cost of operations was 18039 million 17144 million and 16054 million or as a percentage of revenue 630 633 and 638 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth 

  the following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue 

 

 

 

a description of our cost categories is as follows 

 

  

the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies as such care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to those of other companies 

 

depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 2717 million 2524 million and 2338 million or as a percentage of revenue 95 93 and 93 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars for the periods presented is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period is due to an increase in depreciation expense associated with vehicles and equipment acquired in 2005 

 

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts covenants not to compete and customer relationships expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 71 million 70 million and 53 million or as a percentage of revenue 2 3 and 2 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other intangible assets during the three months ended september 30 2004 resulting from an extensive internal review of all recent acquisitions the 

  increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with businesses acquired during 2004 

 

accretion expense accretion expense was 145 million 137 million and 127 million or as a percentage of revenue 5 for each of the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to expansion of our landfill operations 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 2895 million 2683 million and 2479 million or as a percentage of revenue 101 99 and 98 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our business the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period is primarily due to approximately 30 million of costs incurred during the first quarter of 2005 associated with the exchange of unsecured notes it is also due to a 21 million noncash charge incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to higher compensation costs 

 

we believe that selling general and administrative expenses in the range of 10 of revenue are appropriate for 2006 given our business platform 

 

operating income operating income was 4772 million 4523 million and 4127 million or as a percentage of revenue 167 167 and 164 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

interest expense we incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 810 million 767 million and 780 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates on our floatingrate debt an increase in debt balances and fees associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in 2005 in may 2004 2250 million of our public notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in interest expense which was partially offset by increases in interest expense resulting from additional taxexempt financing obtained during 2004 

 

capitalized interest was 20 million 21 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

interest income and other income expense net interest income and other income net of other expense was 130 million 81 million and 127 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash restricted cash and marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003 the increase in aggregate dollars during the year ended december 31 2005 versus the comparable period last year is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates in may 2004 we used a portion of our outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities balances to repay 2250 million of public notes 

 

income taxes our provision for income taxes was 1555 million 1458 million and 1320 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our effective income tax rate was 380 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles during the first quarter of 2003 we adopted sfas 143 sfas 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs related to our landfills as of january 1 2003 we recorded an aftertax expense of 208 million or 336 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas 143 in addition we also recorded an aftertax expense of 170 million or 274 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems this change in accounting principle for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of sfas 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry 

  landfill and environmental matters 

 

available airspace 

 

the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

 

at december 31 2002 207 of our total available airspace or 3533 million cubic yards consists of probable expansion airspace at twenty of our landfills at december 31 2005 101 of our total available airspace or 1777 million cubic yards consists of probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills this decrease in probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace 

 

during 2003 total available airspace increased by 561 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates during 2004 total available airspace decreased by 155 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill during 2005 total available 

  airspace increased by 36 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken the acquisition of a landfill permits granted and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by airspace consumed 

 

as of december 31 2005 we owned or operated 59 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 18 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2005 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 16 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet our expansion criteria see note 3 accrued landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

as of december 31 2005 nine of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these nine landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 34 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years 

 

the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 

sites with expansion airspace includes one landfill with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

 

final capping closure and postclosure costs 

 

as of january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” this statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs see note 3 accrued landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

as of december 31 2005 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 2395 million the current portion of these costs of 270 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion of these costs of 2125 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

  investment in landfills 

 

the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 

 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2005 and 2004 our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard 

 

as of december 31 2005 we expect to spend an estimated additional 14948 million on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 24 billion or 134 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

 

we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate no material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

financial condition 

 

at december 31 2005 we had 1318 million of cash and cash equivalents we also had 2553 million of restricted cash deposits including 1449 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities and 253 million pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills 

 

in june 2005 we entered into a new 7500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in 2010 this facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated 7500 million borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other requirements at december 31 2005 letters of credit outstanding totaling 3912 million were secured by our revolving credit facility as a result as of december 31 2005 we had 3588 million available under our credit facility 

 

in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public market 2250 million of these notes bore interest at 6625 per annum and matured in may 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7125 per annum and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively in march 2005 we exchanged 2757 million of our outstanding 7125 notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035 the new notes bear interest at 6086 we paid a premium of 276 million related to the exchange this premium will be amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method 

  in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 675 and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 

 

in march 2005 we entered into a 539 million capital lease related to a landfill 

 

in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions the swap agreements have total notional values of 2250 million and 2100 million respectively and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at fixed rates of 6625 and 675 respectively swap agreements with a notional value of 2250 million matured in may 2004 and agreements with a notional value of 2100 million mature in august 2011 

 

at december 31 2005 we had 6454 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which approximately 1195 million were obtained during fiscal 2005 borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 325 to 563 at december 31 2005 and have maturities ranging from 2006 to 2037 as of december 31 2005 we had 1449 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

 

we believe that our excess cash cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary 

 

selected balance sheet accounts 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities and accrued selfinsurance during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2003 2004 and 2005 was 4 3 and 2 respectively as of december 31 2005 accounts receivable were 2800 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 173 million resulting in days sales outstanding of 34 or 22 days net of deferred revenue in addition at december 31 2005 our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled 168 million or 57 of gross receivables outstanding 

 

our expense for selfinsurance as a percentage of revenue for 2003 2004 and 2005 was 75 61 and 56 respectively the increase in selfinsurance expense during 2003 relative to 2004 and 2005 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our 2003 policy year based on actuarial claims experience expected claims development and medical cost inflation we believe that during 2006 our selfinsurance expense will be in the range of 55 of revenue 

  property and equipment 

 

the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 are discussed below 

 

cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 7675 million 6663 million and 6005 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments for accounts payable and income taxes 

 

in december 2003 we received written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization depletion and final capping closure and postclosure expense for tax purposes as a result of this change we recorded a tax receivable of approximately 480 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended december 31 2004 also during the year ended december 31 2004 we collected a 230 million note receivable associated with a divested business 

 

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was higher than expected because of a 1134 million federal tax payment that was deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue 

  service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures 

 

as a result of the timing of these payments we expect cash provided by operating activities during 2006 to be lower than 2005 

 

we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments and debt repayments 

 

cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was 2972 million 2067 million and 5524 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented cash provided by restricted marketable securities in 2004 and cash provided by the disposition of our operations in western new york in 2005 capital additions were 3287 million 2838 million and 2732 million during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively cash used to acquire businesses net of cash acquired was 267 million 473 million and 515 million during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

the increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003 consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees in 2004 we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the 2250 million of public notes we used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated 

 

we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand restricted cash held for capital expenditures cash flow from operations our revolving credit facility taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 

 

cash flows used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was 4800 million 4373 million and 704 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and primarily includes proceeds from issuances of taxexempt bonds repayments of debt repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to equitybased compensation and payments of cash dividends dividends paid were 722 million 460 million and 190 million during 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in 2004 repayments of debt include the liquidation of 2250 million of public notes 

 

from 2000 through 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15250 million of our common stock as of december 31 2005 we paid 13088 million to repurchase 515 million shares of our common stock of which 5584 million was paid during 2005 to repurchase 163 million shares of our common stock 

 

we used proceeds from our cash on hand liquidation of marketable securities cash flow from operations and taxexempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt we intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand cash flow from operations our revolving credit facility and other financings 

 

credit rating 

 

our company has received investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2005 our senior debt was rated bbb by standard  poor’s bbb by fitch and baa2 by moody’s 

 

fuel hedge 

 

during march 2005 we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases under sfas 133 the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases these option agreements settle each month in equal notional amounts through december 2005 in accordance with sfas 133 the ineffective portion of the change in fair value for the year ended december 31 2005 was not material and has been included in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income realized gains of 25 million related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  in october 2005 we entered into new option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases these option agreements commence on january 1 2006 and settle each month in equal notional amounts of 500000 gallons through december 31 2006 in accordance with sfas 133 4 million representing the effective portion of the change in fair value as of december 31 2005 net of tax has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 in millions 

 

 

 

the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure expenditures presented above are undiscounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2005 

 

unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of longterm disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at thirdparty facilities 

 

offbalance arrangements 

 

we do not have or engage in any offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt all items described below are nontrading 

 

 

  the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates 

 

free cash flow 

 

we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is calculated as follows in millions 

 

 

 

free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2005 was higher than the previous years presented primarily because of a 1134 million federal tax payment that was deferred until february 2006 as a result of an internal revenue service notice issued in response to hurricane katrina and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures 

 

as a result of the timing of these payments we expect free cash flow during 2006 to be lower than 2005 

 

we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders paying cash dividends maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

 

seasonality 

 

our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

 

we are required to adopt sfas 123r on january 1 2006 and expect to use the “modifiedprospective” method in which compensation cost will be recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date 

  as permitted by sfas 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method may have a significant impact on our results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas 123r depends on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future we estimate that adopting sfas 123r will reduce 2006 earnings per share by approximately three cents which includes incentive compensation granted in lieu of stock options sfas 123r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 294 million 106 million and 67 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees effective december 30 2005 as a result of this acceleration we recorded a noncash charge of 21 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 this acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of sfas 123r and in anticipation of changes to our compensation programs beginning in 2006 

 

there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to our company

report of management on republic services inc’s internal control over financial reporting 

 

we as members of management of republic services inc are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 business tableend company overview 

  we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 96 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities 

  as of december 31 2004 our operations were organized into five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas and each area contains a group of operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of operating segments 

  we had revenue of 27081 million and 25178 million and operating income of 4523 million and 4127 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the 1903 million or 76 increase in revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below the 396 million or 96 increase in operating income from 2003 to 2004 is partially due to higher selfinsurance expense during 2003 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through the 2003 policy year the remaining increase in operating income is due to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below 

  our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including california florida georgia nevada north carolina south carolina and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate 

  we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below 

industry overview 

  based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 440 billion of which approximately 50 is generated by publiclyowned waste companies 21 is generated by privatelyheld waste companies and 29 is generated by municipal and other local governmental authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the publiclyowned companies’ total revenue however according to industry data the domestic nonhazardous waste industry remains highly fragmented as privatelyheld companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 50 of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation 

  the solid waste industry experienced a period of rapid consolidation in the late 1990’s during that time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions however acquisitions in the industry have slowed considerably since late 1999 despite this we believe that the opportunity to grow through acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than experienced in previous years as a result of the following factors 

 1    these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous privatelyheld companies in the industry have contributed to the overall consolidation trend in the solid waste industry 

financial strategy 

  a key component of our financial strategy is our ability to generate free cash flow our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that free cash flow provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct monthly field operating reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing free cash flow 

  free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

  we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable 

  we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following

   another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure favorable longterm fixedrate financing that reduces our exposure to changing interest rates this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to readily access capital markets

 6  operations 

  our operations primarily consist of the collection transfer and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste 

  collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 22 states through 140 collection companies in 2004 743 of our revenue was derived from collection services consisting of approximately 325 from services provided to municipal and residential customers 366 from services provided to commercial customers and 309 from services provided to industrial and other customers 

  our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service 

  in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by such considerations as 

   we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal 

  also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers 

7   transfer and disposal services we own or operate 96 transfer stations we deposit waste at these stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities as of december 31 2004 we owned or operated 58 landfills which had approximately 8904 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 17 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities and the ability to expand our sites successfully some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see “— properties” 

  most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted as designed 

  other services we have 35 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these facilities sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing third party recycling facilities thereby minimizing our recycling investment 

  we provide remediation and other heavy construction services primarily through our subsidiary located in missouri 

  we also have a texasbased compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products 

sales and marketing 

  we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers 

  we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities 

  most of our marketing activity is local in nature however in 2000 we initiated a national accounts program in response to our customers’ needs 

  we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate 

customers 

  we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

8 competition 

  we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience 

  competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publiclyowned companies including waste management and allied waste industries several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenues and taxexempt financing 

  we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability 

  in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of waste such as yard waste at landfills this may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be recycled 

regulation 

  our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor 

  we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established remediation reserves that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserves 

  federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations 

 9  10    state regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively 

  in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these are difficult and timeconsuming to obtain are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity 

  many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet in all material respects all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations 

11 related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters various states have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from that involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws from that involved in and implicated by that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has considered passing legislation authorizing states and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect our operations 

  we have established a reserve for landfill and environmental costs which includes landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — landfill and environmental matters” and “risk factors — compliance with environmental regulation may impede our growth” 

liability insurance and bonding 

  the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 

  we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability worker’s compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

12   our insurance programs for worker’s compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

  in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental permits and certain business licenses and permits bonds issued by surety companies operate as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 we employed approximately 13400 fulltime employees approximately 3100 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our employees 

compensation 

  we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with the company’s overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based upon free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our company’s overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our company’s short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals 

corporate history 

  we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 by our former parent company autonation inc in 1998 autonation separated its nonhazardous solid waste services division from its other businesses and we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock in 1999 autonation sold substantially all of its remaining interest in our company in a secondary public offering 

availability of reports and other information 

  our corporate website is httpwwwrepublicservicescom we make available on this website free of charge access to our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statement on schedule 14a and amendments to those materials filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically submit such material to the securities and exchange commission our corporate website also contains our corporate governance guidelines code of ethics and charters of the nominating and corporate governance committee audit committee and compensation committee of the board of directors in addition the commission’s website is httpwwwsecgov the commission makes available on this website free of charge reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers such as us that file electronically with the commission information on our website or the commission’s website is not part of this document 

13 risk factors 

  this annual report on form 10k includes “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended including in particular certain statements about our plans strategies and prospects although we believe that our plans intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that such plans intentions or expectations will be achieved important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forwardlooking statements include those set forth in this risk factors section all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires otherwise all references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” include republic services inc and its subsidiaries 

  if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete effectively 

  we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment 

  we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing 

  we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract 

  in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or “tipping” fees geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 

  as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time 

economic conditions could adversely affect our business operations and internal growth 

  in the past economic slowdowns have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing the manufacturing sector and the nonresidential construction industry landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity were also impacted a slowdown in the economy in any of the markets we service could adversely affect volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal operations 

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business 

  our operations are dependent upon fuel which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis during 2003 and 2004 we experienced increases in the cost of fuel a portion of this increase was passed on to our customers however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no assurances that we will be able to pass on current or any future increases in fuel prices to our customers due to political instability in oilproducing countries fuel prices may continue to increase significantly in 2005 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business 

14 we may be unable to execute our financial strategy 

  our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 

  our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business to fund our internal growth to acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common stock pay dividends minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the amount of our dividends 

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 

  our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time in short we cannot assure you that 

   additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy may require spending significant amounts of capital if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 

  our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required 

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

  in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

15 our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 

  our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation deferred taxes and selfinsurance 

  we cannot assure you that our reserves for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us 

changes in insurance markets may impact our financial results 

  due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense 

we depend on key personnel 

  our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth 

  we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or our loss of significant permits or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects 

regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may be delayed or denied 

  our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens’ groups and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 

16 seasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

  our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

we may be unable to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit facility 

  we have a revolving shortterm credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million which expires in june 2005 we anticipate extending the maturity of this credit facility until at least june 2006 however we cannot assure you that we will receive such extension and if so whether such extension will be on terms as favorable to us as those currently contained in the credit facility 

the outcome of audits by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our company 

  through the date of our initial public offering in july 1998 we filed consolidated federal income tax returns with autonation in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we have with autonation we may be liable for certain assessments imposed by the internal revenue service for the periods through june 1998 the internal revenue service is auditing our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 no assurance can be given with respect to the outcome of the audits for these periods or the effect they may have on us or that our reserves with respect thereto are adequate a significant assessment against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form 10k 

overview of our business 

  we are a leading provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states we provide solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 96 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities 

  we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal recycling compost mulch and soil operations 

  the following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 in millions 

   our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets derive revenue from longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill services is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 

  the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes transfer disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2004 approximately 54 of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 

  our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based upon 

23 the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation natural and synthetic liners construction of leachate collection systems installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 

  cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 

  our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments from 2003 to 2004 operating income increased in our eastern southern and western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy in the central region increased revenue was offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs related to the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors in the southwestern region revenue growth was impeded by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special waste contract during 2003 the decrease in costs for corporate entities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in selfinsurance expense 

2004 financial objectives 

  in january 2004 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these objectives included the following 

 2004 business performance 

  during 2004 we achieved our earnings per share objective and exceeded our internal growth free cash flow and share repurchase objectives 

  our internal growth from core operations for 2004 was 59 with 23 from price increases and 36 from volume growth during 2004 our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broadbased pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003 we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts our core volume growth was also positively impacted by the hurricanes in addition our geographic mix of business which is concentrated in high growth markets positively impacted our operating results as a result during 2004 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 

  during 2004 our operating margins improved primarily due to lower selfinsurance expense this benefit was partially offset by increased costs for fuel labor and subcontracting costs associated with the longhaul transport of waste by third party vendors the net expansion in our operating margin allowed us to achieve diluted earnings per share of 153 during the year ended december 31 2004 

24   during 2004 we generated free cash flow of 3882 million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of 6663 million less purchases of property and equipment of 2838 million plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 57 million which substantially exceeded our objective our free cash flow was positively impacted by lower than expected cash taxes due to bonus depreciation and our change in tax method related to certain landfill costs 

  in april 2004 our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization from 2000 million to 2750 million during 2004 we used our free cash flow to repurchase approximately 96 million shares of our common stock for 2661 million also during the third quarter of 2004 our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to 12 per share 

2005 financial objectives 

  our financial objectives for 2005 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2004 specific guidance is as follows 

   we expect our free cash flow during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation higher purchases of property and equipment and several onetime items that benefited previous periods including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004 and an increase in selfinsurance reserves during 2003 

2005 business initiatives 

  our business initiatives for 2005 are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior three years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2005 are as follows

 26 critical accounting policies and disclosures 

  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

 27  28  29  30  31  32  business combinations 

  we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

  we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was 474 million 515 million and 558 million respectively 

  cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately 132 million as of december 31 2004 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15627 million 

  during 2004 282 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace as of december 31 2004 we had 7436 million of landfill development costs net of accumulated depletion and amortization which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other nondepletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily final capping closure and postclosure liabilities landfill purchase price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 

33   goodwill for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately 212 million as of december 31 2003 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15581 million 277 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 

  goodwill for 2002 acquisitions totaled approximately 401 million as of december 31 2002 we had goodwill net of accumulated amortization of 15442 million 

consolidated results of operations 

   our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was 2379 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 2154 million in 2003 and 2396 million in 2002 net income was 2379 million for year ended december 31 2004 or 153 per diluted share as compared to 1776 million or 110 per diluted share in 2003 and 2396 million or 144 per diluted share in 2002 net income for the year ended december 31 2003 includes an aftertax expense of 378 million net of an income tax benefit of 231 million or 23 per share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems see note 1 basis of presentation of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles our operating results for the year ended december 31 2002 include other charges income described below 

  the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2002 through 2004 

   revenue revenue was 27081 million 25178 million and 23651 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively revenue increased by 1903 million or 76 from 2003 to 

34 2004 revenue increased by 1527 million or 65 from 2002 to 2003 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

   cost of operations cost of operations was 17144 million 16054 million and 14729 million or as a percentage of revenue 633 638 and 623 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

35   the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions 

  the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 and the decrease in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to higher selfinsurance expense in 2003 selfinsurance expense was 1653 million 1895 million and 1381 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in selfinsurance expense in 2003 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through the 2003 policy year 

  excluding selfinsurance expense cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased during the year ended december 31 2004 versus the comparable 2003 period this increase is primarily attributable to increased fuel prices labor costs and subcontracting costs associated with the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors excluding selfinsurance expense cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2003 versus the comparable 2002 period due to the elimination of closure and postclosure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with sfas 143 in 2003 and the termination of our operating lease facility in july 2002 this decrease was partially offset by increased fuel prices an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors 

  to date in 2005 we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel health insurance risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and general economic conditions 

  depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 2524 million 2338 million and 1935 million or as a percentage of revenue 93 93 and 82 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of sfas 143 the remaining increase from 2002 to 2003 is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease 

  amortization of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts covenants not to compete and customer relationships expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 70 million 53 million and 61 million or as a percentage of revenue 3 2 and 2 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other intangible assets during the three months ended september 30 2004 resulting from an extensive internal review of all recent acquisitions the increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with businesses acquired during 2004 

  accretion expense accretion expense was 137 million and 127 million or as a percentage of revenue 5 and 5 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively versus 0 for 2002 accretion expense resulted from the adoption of sfas 143 as of january 1 2003 the increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2004 is primarily due to expansion of our landfill operations 

  selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 2683 million 2479 million and 2387 million or as a percentage of revenue 99 98 and 101 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to higher compensation costs the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base 

36   we believe that selling general and administrative expenses in the range of 10 of revenue are appropriate for 2005 given our business platform 

  other charges income during the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a 56 million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made and recorded as other charges during the fourth quarter of 2001 

  operating income operating income was 4523 million 4127 million and 4595 million or as a percentage of revenue 167 164 and 194 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  interest expense we incurred interest expense on our unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 767 million 780 million and 770 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in may 2004 2250 million of our public notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in interest expense which was partially offset by increases in interest expense resulting from additional taxexempt financing obtained during 2004 the increase in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional taxexempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates 

  capitalized interest was 21 million 33 million and 25 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  interest income and other income expense net interest income and other income net of other expense was 81 million 127 million and 40 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash restricted cash and marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003 in may 2004 we used a portion of our outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities balances to repay 2250 million of public notes 

  income taxes our provision for income taxes was 1458 million 1320 million and 1469 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively our effective income tax rate was 380 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles during the first quarter of 2003 we adopted sfas 143 sfas 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs related to our landfills as of january 1 2003 we recorded an aftertax expense of 208 million or 336 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas 143 in addition we also recorded an aftertax expense of 170 million or 274 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems this change in accounting principle for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of sfas 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry 

37 landfill and environmental matters 

   the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

     changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes 

  during 2002 total available airspace increased by 226 million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption during 2003 total available airspace increased by 561 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates during 2004 total available airspace decreased by 155 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill 

  as of december 31 2004 we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 17 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum 

38 of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2004 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 15 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 2 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet our expansion criteria see note 3 accrued landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

  as of december 31 2004 twelve of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these twelve landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years 

  the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31 2004 

   sites with expansion airspace include four landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace 

   as of january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” this statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs see note 3 accrued landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

  as of december 31 2004 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 2168 million the current portion of these costs of 146 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion of these costs of 2022 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 

39 investment in landfills 

  the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2004 in millions 

    40   the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion amortization and accretion expense for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 it also shows on a pro forma basis what our depletion amortization and accretion expense would have been if sfas 143 and the changes in accounting principles relating to our methane gas collection systems were effective on january 1 2002 

   during the twelve months ended december 31 2004 and 2003 our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard 

  as of december 31 2004 we expect to spend an estimated additional 15241 million on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected gross investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 23 billion or 132 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method 

  we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate no significant amounts were charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

financial condition 

  at december 31 2004 we had 2370 million of restricted cash deposits and 387 million of restricted marketable securities held as financial guarantees including 1190 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities and 343 million and 387 million of restricted cash and restricted marketable securities respectively pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our landfills restricted marketable securities consist of mutual funds invested in shortterm investment grade securities including mortgagebacked securities and us government obligations these securities are available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices unrealized gains and losses net of tax are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the 2250 million of public notes which matured in may 2004 

  in july 1998 we entered into a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 5000 million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in july 2002 and the remaining 5000 million was scheduled to expire in july 2003 as a result of our strong financial position and liquidity in february 2002 we 

41 reduced the short and longterm portions of our credit facility to 3000 million and 4500 million respectively in july 2002 we renewed the longand shortterm portions of our credit facility respectively on substantially the same terms and conditions with the longterm portion expiring in 2007 and the shortterm portion expiring in 2003 the shortterm portion of the facility was renewed again in july 2003 and 2004 and expires in june 2005 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our taxexempt debt financings to finance our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other requirements as of december 31 2004 we had 3734 million available under our credit facility 

  in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public market 2250 million of these notes bore interest at 6 5  8  per annum and matured in may 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7 1  8  per annum and mature in 2009 interest on the outstanding notes is payable semiannually in may and november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively 

  in december 1999 we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying 726 million using our excess cash which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time 

  in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 6 3  4  and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 

  in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions the swap agreements have total notional values of 2250 million and 2100 million respectively and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at fixed rates of 6 5  8  and 6 3  4  respectively swap agreements with a notional value of 2250 million matured in may 2004 and agreements with a notional value of 2100 million mature in august 2011 

  at december 31 2004 we had 5273 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which approximately 655 million were obtained during fiscal 2004 borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 2 to 5 1  4  at december 31 2004 and have maturities ranging from 2005 to 2037 as of december 31 2004 we had 1190 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 

  on february 16 2005 we commenced an offer to the holders of our 7 1  8  unsecured notes due 2009 to exchange up to 2750 million aggregate principal amount of such notes for a like principal amount of new notes due 2035 this offering is conditioned upon receiving valid tenders of at least 1750 million of the aggregate principal of existing notes these new notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a the bid side yield on the 5375 us treasury note due february 15 2031 calculated on the second business day prior to the expiration date of our exchange offering and b 130 basis points the total exchange price for the old notes is intended to result in a yield to maturity on the settlement date equal to the sum of a the bidside yield on the 3875 us treasury note due may 15 2009 calculated on the second business day prior to the expiration date and b 35 basis points the exchange offering is expected to close march 16 2005 unless further extended by us however we cannot assure you that the conditions to the exchange offering will be met and the transaction will be consummated 

  we plan to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit facility prior to its expiration in june 2005 to june 2006 or later we believe that these actions would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe that we would be able 

42 to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions however we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing shortterm credit facility on the same terms 

selected balance sheet accounts 

  the following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts final capping closure postclosure and remediation liabilities and accrued selfinsurance during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 in millions 

   43   our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2002 2003 and 2004 was 5 4 and 3 respectively 

  as of december 31 2004 accounts receivable were 2687 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 180 million resulting in days sales outstanding of 35 days or 22 days net of deferred revenue in addition at december 31 2004 our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled 164 million or 57 of gross receivables outstanding 

  our expense for selfinsurance as a percentage of revenue for 2002 2003 and 2004 was 58 75 and 61 respectively the increase in selfinsurance expense from 2002 to 2003 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our 2003 policy year based on recent actuarial claims experience expected claims development and medical cost inflation 

property and equipment 

  the following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 in millions 

  44     45   capital additions for 2002 include 726 million used to purchase equipment consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease 

liquidity and capital resources 

  the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 are discussed below 

  cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were 6663 million 6005 million and 5697 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business the timing of payments received for accounts receivable and the timing of payments for accounts payable and income taxes 

  in december 2003 we received written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization depletion and final capping closure and postclosure costs for tax purposes as a result of this change we recorded a tax receivable of approximately 480 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended december 31 2004 also during the year ended december 31 2004 we collected a 230 million note receivable associated with a divested business 

  we expect our cash flow from operating activities during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation and several onetime items that benefited previous periods including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004 and an increase in selfinsurance reserves during 2003 

  we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments and debt repayments 

  cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was 2067 million 5524 million and 3163 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions for all the periods presented and cash provided by restricted marketable securities in 2004 capital additions were 2838 million 2732 million and 2586 million during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively cash used to acquire businesses net of cash acquired was 473 million 515 million and 558 million during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  the increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003 consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees in 2004 we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the 2250 million of public notes we used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated 

  we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand cash flows from operations our revolving credit facility taxexempt bonds and other financings we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 

  cash flows used in financing activities cash flows used in financing activities was 4373 million 704 million and 1280 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and primarily include proceeds from issuances of taxexempt bonds repayments of debt and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program dividends paid were 460 million and 190 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively in 2004 repayments of debt include the liquidation of 2250 million of public notes 

  from 2000 through 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10250 million of our common stock as of december 31 2004 we paid 7504 million to repurchase approximately 352 million shares of our common stock of which 2661 million was paid during 2004 to repurchase approximately 96 million shares of our common stock 

46   in december 1999 we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we retired this facility using our excess cash 

  we used proceeds from our cash on hand liquidation of marketable securities cash flow from operations and taxexempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt we intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand cash flow from operations our revolving credit facility and other financings 

credit rating 

  our company has received investment grade credit ratings as of december 31 2004 our senior debt was rated bbbpositive by standard  poor’s bbbpositive by fitch and baa2 by moody’s 

operating lease facility 

  in december 1999 we entered into a 1000 million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying 726 million using our excess cash which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time

  during june 2001 we entered into option agreements for approximately 143 million gallons of heating oil under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases these option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts expiring in december 2002 the option agreements were structured as zerocost collars indexed to the price of heating oil in accordance with sfas 133 16 million net of tax representing the effective portion of the change in fair value has been recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31 2002 the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of approximately 1 million for the year ended december 31 2002 has been included in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income realized losses of 8 million for the year ended december 31 2002 related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income 

contractual obligations 

  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 in millions 

   the estimated remaining final capping closure and postclosure expenditures presented above are undiscounted and include both payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31 2004 and estimated future liabilities expected to be incurred as the remaining landfill disposal capacities are consumed 

47   unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of longterm disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities 

  we do not have or engage in any offbalance sheet arrangements 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a “forwardlooking statement” our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt all items described below are nontrading 

   the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates 

free cash flow 

  we define free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards gaap as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows our free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is calculated as follows in millions 

   we expect our free cash flow during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation higher purchases of property and equipment and several onetime items that benefited previous periods including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004 and an increase in selfinsurance reserves during 2003 

  we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders paying cash dividends maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt in addition free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or 

48 that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

seasonality 

  our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 

new accounting pronouncements 

  on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 

  sfas 123r must be adopted by public companies no later than july 1 2005 early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued we expect to adopt sfas 123r on july 1 2005 

  sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 

   the company plans to adopt sfas 123r using the modifiedprospective method 

  as permitted by sfas 123 the company currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position the impact of adoption of sfas 123r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future sfas 123r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things when employees exercise stock options the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 106 million 67 million and 40 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

report of management on republic services inc’s internal control over financial reporting 

  we as members of management of republic services inc are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  because of its inherent limitations our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 business tableend company overview   we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 142 collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 93 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities   as of december 31 2003 our operations were organized into five regions whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas and each area contains a group of operating locations each of our regions and substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of operating segments   we had revenue of 25178 million and 23651 million and operating income of 4127 million and 4595 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the 1527 million or 65 increase in revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating and growth strategies described below the 468 million or 102 decrease in operating income from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to additional selfinsurance expense   our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including california florida georgia nevada north carolina south carolina and texas and in other domestic markets that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates that are generally higher than the industry’s overall growth rate   while we believe that we are well positioned to continue to increase our revenue and operating income in the longer term the economic slowdown has had a negative impact on certain aspects of our business however the aspects of our business that we believe are “recession resilient” have continued to perform well these include our residential and commercial collection operations which are flatrate businesses and are not subject to the volatility we experience in our industrial collection and disposal businesses we continue to focus on enhancing stockholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies as described below industry overview   based on analysts’ reports and industry trade publications we believe that the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual revenue of approximately 430 billion of which approximately 59 is generated by publiclyowned waste companies 28 is generated by privatelyheld waste companies and 13 is generated by municipal and other local governmental authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the publiclyowned companies’ total revenue however according to industry data the domestic nonhazardous waste industry remains highly fragmented as privatelyheld companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities generate approximately 41 of total industry revenue in general growth in the solid waste industry is linked to growth in the overall economy including the level of new household and business formation   the solid waste industry has experienced a period of rapid consolidation during this time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions however acquisitions in the industry have slowed considerably since 1 late 1999 despite this we believe that the opportunity to grow through acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than experienced in previous years as a result of the following factors 

   these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous privatelyheld companies in the industry have contributed to the overall consolidation trend in the solid waste industry financial strategy   a key component of our financial strategy is our ability to generate free cash flow our definition of free cash flow which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards is cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows we believe that free cash flow provides useful information regarding the recurring cash provided by our operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct monthly field operating reviews that help focus our entire company on the importance of increasing free cash flow   free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies   we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable   we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder value as well as our return on investment this includes the following  2    another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure favorable longterm fixedrate financing that reduces our exposure to changing interest rates this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to readily access capital markets   for certain risks related to our financial strategy see “risk factors” operating strategy   we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy to accomplish this goal is to    for certain risks related to our operating strategy see “risk factors”   3   4    for certain risks related to our operating strategy see “risk factors” growth strategy   our growth strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and enhancing stockholder value through internal growth and acquisitions it also focuses on securing price increases necessary to offset increased costs during the fourth quarter of 2003 we implemented a broadbased pricing initiative across all lines of our business for certain risks related to our growth strategy see “risk factors”   5       6  operations   our operations primarily consist of the collection and disposal of nonhazardous solid waste   collection services we provide solid waste collection services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 22 states through 142 collection companies in 2003 75 of our revenue was derived from collection services consisting of approximately 32 from services provided to municipal and residential customers 38 from services provided to commercial customers and 30 from services provided to industrial and other customers   our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service   in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by such considerations as    we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a landfill or a transfer station for disposal   we own or operate 93 transfer stations we deposit waste at these stations as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities   also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial customers   disposal services as of december 31 2003 we owned or operated 58 landfills which had approximately 8607 permitted acres and total available permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 18 billion inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based 7 on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities and the ability to expand our sites successfully some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see “— properties” 

  most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our landfills although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted as designed   other services we have 35 materials recovery facilities and other recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these facilities primarily sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and nonrecyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing third party facilities thereby minimizing our recycling investment   we provide remediation and other heavy construction services primarily through our subsidiary located in missouri during 2002 our subsidiary was awarded a contract to assist on the riverside levy project in missouri revenue from this project which is scheduled to be completed in 2004 is expected to be approximately 500 million of which approximately 410 million has already been recorded   we also have a texasbased compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products sales and marketing   we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers   we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small quantity generators to large “fortune 500” companies and municipalities   most of our marketing activity is local in nature however in 2000 we initiated a national accounts program in response to our customers’ needs   we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired companies’ local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we operate customers   we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years 8 competition   we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience   competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large national publiclyowned companies including waste management and allied waste industries several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenues and taxexempt financing   we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability   in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills this may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of certain solid waste items to be recycled regulation   our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the ability to obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor   we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established a reserve that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to cover any potential regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual costs will not exceed our reserve   federal regulation the following summarizes the primary environmental public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states that affect our facilities and operations  9  10    state regulation each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain wastes in solid waste landfills including yard waste newspapers beverage containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively   in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals must be obtained these are difficult and timeconsuming to obtain are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups may be subject to periodic renewal and are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity   many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet in all material respects all applicable regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response costs and 11 other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

  finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulated such matters various states have enacted or promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from that involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also attempted to distinguish proposed laws from that involved in and implicated by that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has considered passing legislation authorizing states and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect our operations   we have established a reserve for landfill and environmental costs which includes landfill site final capping closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used to expense final capping closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current information and regulatory requirements we believe that our reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental laws may change and there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — landfill and environmental matters” and “risk factors — compliance with environmental regulation may impede our growth” liability insurance and bonding   the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive   we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices liability pollution liability directors and officers liability worker’s compensation and employer’s liability coverage as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 12   our insurance programs for worker’s compensation general liability vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not reported due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense   in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental permits and certain business licenses and permits bonds issued by surety companies operate as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds employees   as of december 31 2003 we employed approximately 12900 fulltime employees approximately 3200 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our employees compensation   we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and corporate management team with the company’s overall goal of generating increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are based upon free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each manager’s geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure that these individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company incentive compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our company’s overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our company’s short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals corporate history   we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 by our former parent company autonation inc in 1998 autonation separated its nonhazardous solid waste services division from its other businesses and we completed an initial public offering of shares of our common stock in 1999 autonation sold substantially all of its remaining interest in our company in a secondary public offering availability of reports and

expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires otherwise all references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” include republic services inc and its subsidiaries   if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete effectively   we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment   we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt financing   we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract   in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid waste volume on the basis of disposal or “tipping” fees geographical location and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors   as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively from time to time economic conditions may continue to adversely affect our business operations and internal growth   during 2001 the economic slowdown reduced recycling commodity prices which negatively impacted our operating margins the economic slowdown also negatively impacted the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and the nonresidential construction industry landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken furthermore the portion of our business that services the residential construction industry was negatively impacted toward the latter part of 2001 during 2002 landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken a continued slowdown in the economy could further adversely affect volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal operations an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business   our operations are dependent upon fuel which we purchase in the open market on a daily basis during 2003 we experienced an increase in the cost of fuel a portion of this increase was passed on to our customers to date in 2004 we have experienced an additional increase in the cost of fuel however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no assurances that we will be able to pass on the recent or any future increases in fuel prices to our customers due to political instability in oilproducing countries 14 fuel prices may continue to increase significantly in 2004 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business 

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy   our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our control   our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business to fund our internal growth to acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common stock pay dividends minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder value we cannot assure you that we will be successful in executing our new broadbased pricing program that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or that we will be able to pay cash dividends or increase the amount of our dividends we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy   our ability to execute our growth strategy still depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the same time in short we cannot assure you that    additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy requires spending significant amounts of capital if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected we may be unable to manage our growth effectively   our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations and systems to the extent and in the time required businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities   in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired 15 companies by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 

our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs accruals for final capping closure and postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation income taxes and selfinsurance   we cannot assure you that our reserves for landfill and environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing environmental regulations future changes or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us changes in insurance markets may impact our financial results   due to the variable condition of the insurance market we have experienced and may continue to experience in the future increased selfinsurance retention levels and increased premiums as we assume more risk for selfinsurance through higher retention levels we may experience more variability in our selfinsurance reserves and expense we depend on key personnel   our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our growth   we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or our loss of significant permits or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or prospects regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may be delayed or denied   our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens’ groups and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these challenges has 16 at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition failure to receive regulatory approval may prohibit us from establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities 

seasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations   our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities we may be unable to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit facility   we have a revolving shortterm credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million which expires in july 2004 we anticipate extending the maturity of this credit facility until july 2005 however we cannot assure you that we will receive such extension and if so whether such extension will be on terms as favorable to us as those currently contained in the credit facility the outcome of audits by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our company   through the date of our initial public offering in july 1998 we filed consolidated federal income tax returns with autonation the internal revenue service is auditing autonation’s consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1997 through 1998 in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we have with autonation we may be liable for certain assessments imposed by the internal revenue service for the periods through june 1998 resulting from this audit in addition the internal revenue service is auditing our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 no assurance can be given with respect to the outcome of these audits or the effect they may have on us or that our reserves with respect thereto are adequate a significant assessment against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 17

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form 10k overview of our business   we are a leading provider of nonhazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states we provide solid waste collection services for commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 142 collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 93 transfer stations 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities   we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services including recycling and compost mulch and soil operations   the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 in millions    our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years   the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal labor selfinsurance fuel and equipment maintenance costs we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2003 approximately 54 of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate   our landfill costs include daily operating expenses costs of capital for cell development costs for final capping closure and postclosure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site obligations associated with final capping closure and postclosure are capitalized and amortized on a unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed 22   cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace inflation and applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a probable likelihood of being permitted   our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments from 2002 to 2003 operating income increased in our central southwestern and western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy in the eastern and southern regions increased revenue was offset by negative local economic conditions and an increase in costs associated with the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors 2003 financial objectives   in january 2003 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these objectives included the following  2003 business performance   despite a weak economy and a significant increase in insurance expense we were able to exceed our free cash flow internal growth and share repurchase objectives during 2003   the economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and nonresidential construction activity during 2003   despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above our internal growth from core operations for 2003 was 39 with 18 from price increases and 21 from volume growth during 2003 we continued to benefit from several longterm franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during 2002 in addition our geographic mix of business which is concentrated in high growth markets positively impacted our operating results as a result during 2003 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year   during 2003 our operating margins were negatively impacted by increased costs for selfinsurance expense this increase in selfinsurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year based on recent actuarial claims experience expected claims development and medical cost inflation in addition to the economic slowdown and increased costs for selfinsurance during 2003 our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased fuel costs increased depreciation expense primarily associated with capital additions increased state landfill taxes and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business   this decrease in operating margins was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the termination of our operating lease facility and a decrease in selling general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue during 2001 we began a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a number of management information systems such as route optimization customer relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software we continued to realize benefits from these initiatives in 2003 23   notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in selfinsurance and other expenses our earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december 31 2003 was 133 however we were able to generate free cash flow of 3364 million consisting of cash provided by operating activities of 6005 million less purchases of property and equipment of 2732 million plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 91 million which substantially exceeded our objective   during october 2003 our board of directors increased our previously authorized share repurchase program from 1500 million to 1750 million and also authorized an additional 2000 million share repurchase program we used our free cash flow during 2003 to repurchase 84 million shares of our common stock for 1842 million also during july 2003 our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of 06 per share 2004 financial objectives   our financial objectives for 2004 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2003 specific guidance is as follows  business initiatives   our business initiatives for 2004 are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2004 are as follows   24    critical accounting policies and disclosures   our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our 25 company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

 26  27  28  29  30  31 business combinations   we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition   we acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 the aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was 515 million 558 million and 2877 million respectively the aggregate purchase price paid for businesses acquired during 2001 less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed was 2475 million   cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately 212 million as of december 31 2003 we had intangible assets net of accumulated amortization of 15831 million which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired   during 2003 277 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace as of december 31 2003 we had 6906 million of landfill development costs net of accumulated depletion and amortization which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other nondepletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily final capping closure and postclosure liabilities landfill purchase price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate   cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2002 acquisitions totaled approximately 401 million as of december 31 2002 we had intangible assets net of accumulated amortization of 15699 million which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired   cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2001 acquisitions totaled approximately 2233 million as of december 31 2001 we had intangible assets net of accumulated amortization of 15516 million which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in addition during 2001 626 million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace consolidated results of operations 

 

   our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was 2154 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 2396 million in 2002 and 1255 million in 2001 net income for the year ended december 31 2003 includes an aftertax expense of 378 million net of an income tax benefit of 231 million or 23 per share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems see note 1 basis of presentation of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles our operating results for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 include other charges income described below 32   the following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2001 through 2003    revenue revenue was 25178 million 23651 million and 22575 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively revenue increased by 1527 million or 65 from 2002 to 2003 revenue increased by 1076 million or 48 from 2001 to 2002 the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001  

     33       cost of operations cost of operations was 16054 million 14729 million and 14225 million or as a percentage of revenue 638 623 and 630 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   the increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth   the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to selfinsurance expense this increase in selfinsurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year based on recent actuarial claims experience expected claims development and medical cost inflation the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue is also due to increased fuel prices an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the longhaul transport of waste by thirdparty vendors these increases in costs were partially offset by the elimination of closure and postclosure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with sfas 143 and the termination of our operating lease facility   during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax amount 242 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in selfinsurance reserves   excluding the impact of this charge cost of operations for 2001 was 13983 million or 619 as a percent of revenue the increase in adjusted cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the economic slowdown higher costs for selfinsurance and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have higher operating costs these increases in cost of operations were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies higher recycling commodity prices lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility 34   to date in 2004 we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel health insurance risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the severity and duration of the economic slowdown   depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were 2338 million 1935 million and 1683 million or as a percentage of revenue 93 82 and 74 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of sfas 143 the remaining increase from 2002 to 2003 and the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease   amortization of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts covenants not to compete and customer relationships expenses for amortization of intangible assets were 53 million 61 million and 471 million or as a percentage of revenue 2 2 and 21 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in aggregate dollars and as a percent of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” effective january 1 2002 under which most of our intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization   accretion expense accretion expense was 127 million or as a percentage of revenue 5 for the year ended december 31 2003 versus 0 for 2002 and 2001 accretion expense resulted from the adoption of sfas 143 as of january 1 2003   selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 2479 million 2387 million and 2365 million or as a percentage of revenue 98 101 and 105 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth the decrease as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base   during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax amount 82 million was recorded to selling general and administrative expenses excluding the impact of this charge selling general and administrative expenses for 2001 were 2283 million or 101 as a percent of revenue which is consistent with 2002   we believe that selling general and administrative expenses in the range of 10 of revenue are appropriate for 2004 given our business platform   other charges during the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a 56 million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001   during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax amount 996 million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and noncore businesses and asset impairments   operating income operating income was 4127 million 4595 million and 2835 million or as a percentage of revenue 164 194 and 126 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively excluding the impact of the other charges income we recorded in the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001 our operating income was 4539 million or 192 and 4155 million or 184 for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively   interest expense we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 780 million 770 million and 801 million for the years ended 35 december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional taxexempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates the decrease in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in taxexempt financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured notes the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during 2001 and 2002 

  capitalized interest was 33 million 25 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   interest and other income expense net interest and other income net of other expense was 127 million 40 million and 59 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash and restricted cash balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003 and 2001   income taxes our provision for income taxes was 1320 million 1469 million and 838 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our effective income tax rate was 380 380 and 400 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our effective tax rate for 2001 included certain nontaxdeductible items related to the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001 excluding the impact of this charge our effective tax rate for 2001 was 380   cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles during the first quarter of 2003 we adopted sfas 143 sfas 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs related to our landfills as of january 1 2003 we recorded an aftertax expense of 208 million or 336 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas 143 in addition we also recorded an aftertax expense of 170 million or 274 million on a pretax basis as a cumulative effect of a change in account principle for our methane gas collection systems this change in accounting for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of sfas 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry landfill and environmental matters   among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills the additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations 

 

   the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december 31 2001 2002 and 2003  36     changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill’s footprint or vertical slopes   during 2001 total available airspace increased by 341 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken and changes in design partially offset by consumption and divestitures during 2002 total available airspace increased by 226 million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption during 2003 total available airspace increased by 561 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates   as of december 31 2003 we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 18 billion inplace cubic yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of december 31 2003 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 15 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 3 billion inplace cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet our expansion criteria see note 3 accrued landfill environmental and legal costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information   as of december 31 2003 fifteen of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at projected annual volumes these fifteen landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years including probable expansion airspace the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years   as of december 31 2003 four of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process also as of december 31 2003 six of our fifteen landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities the remaining five landfills that meet the criteria for 37 including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level 

 

   as of january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” this statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping closure and postclosure costs see note 3 accrued landfill environmental and legal costs of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information   as of december 31 2003 accrued final capping closure and postclosure costs were 2047 million the current portion of these costs of 295 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion of these costs of 1752 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill environmental and legal costs 

 

   the following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended december 31 2001 2002 and 2003 and the future expected investment as of december 31 2003 in millions    38    the following table reflects our net investment in our landfills excluding nondepletable land and our depletion and amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 it also shows on a pro forma basis what our depletion amortization and accretion expense would have been if sfas 143 and the changes in accounting principles relating to our methane gas collection systems were effective on january 1 2001    during 2003 our weighted average compaction rate for converting cubic yards to tons was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard   as of december 31 2003 we expect to spend an estimated additional 15422 million on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total expected gross investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 23 billion or 130 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption method   we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate no material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 financial condition   one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple costeffective and transparent capital structure   at december 31 2003 we had 2150 million of restricted cash deposits and 1824 million of restricted marketable securities held as financial guarantees including 1046 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities and 405 million and 1824 million of restricted cash and restricted marketable securities respectively pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping closure and postclosure obligations at our 39 landfills restricted marketable securities consist of mutual funds invested in shortterm investment grade securities including mortgagebacked securities and us government obligations these securities are available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices unrealized gains and losses net of tax are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income we intend to liquidate a portion of these marketable securities and use the proceeds to repay the 2250 million of public notes which mature in may 2004 we also intend to use letters of credit to replace the financial guarantees secured by marketable securities to be liquidated 

  in july 1998 we entered into a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 5000 million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in july 2002 and the remaining 5000 million was scheduled to expire in july 2003 as a result of our strong financial position and liquidity in february 2002 we reduced the short and longterm portions of our credit facility to 3000 million and 4500 million respectively in july 2002 we renewed the long and shortterm portions of our credit facility respectively on substantially the same terms and conditions with the longterm portion expiring in 2007 and the shortterm portion expiring in 2003 the shortterm portion of the facility was renewed again in july 2003 and expires in july 2004 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases dividends and other requirements as of december 31 2003 we had 3263 million available under our credit facility   in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public market 2250 million of these notes bear interest at 6 58 per annum and mature in may 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7 18 per annum and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility   in december 1999 we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying 726 million using our excess cash which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time   in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public market the notes bear interest at 6 34 and mature in 2011 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at a discount of 26 million proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility   in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment graderated financial institutions the swap agreements have total notional values of 2250 million and 1050 million respectively and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at fixed rates of 6 58 and 6 34 respectively the swap agreements terminate in may 2004 and august 2011 respectively   at december 31 2003 we had 4632 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings outstanding of which approximately 860 million were obtained during fiscal 2003 borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 115 to 563 at december 31 2003 and have maturities ranging from 2004 to 2033 as of december 31 2003 we had 1046 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements   we intend to repay the 2250 million of public notes that mature in may 2004 using proceeds from the liquidation of our restricted marketable securities our excess cash proceeds from our revolving credit facility or a combination thereof in addition we plan to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit facility prior to its expiration in july 2004 to july 2005 we believe that these actions would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe 40 that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if necessary to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions however we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing shortterm credit facility on the same terms

  in december 2003 we received written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization depletion and final capping closure and postclosure costs for tax purposes as a result of this change our deferred income tax provision increased by approximately 820 million during 2003 and we recorded a tax receivable of

  we have evaluated our organizational structure and have concluded that the portion of fin 46 that is currently effective has no impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we do not expect the portion of fin 46 that is effective on march 31 2004 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   there are no other new accounting pronouncements that pertain to our company 47

company overview

     we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid
waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 142
collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 90 transfer stations
56 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities

     as of december 31 2002 our operations were organized into five regions
whose boundaries may change from time to time eastern central southern
southwestern and western each region is organized into several operating areas
and each area contains a group of operating locations each of our regions and
substantially all our areas provide collection transfer recycling and disposal
services we believe that this organizational structure facilitates the
integration of our operations within each region which is a critical component
of our operating strategy see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of operating segments

     we had revenue of 23651 million and 22575 million and operating
income of 4595 million and 2835 million for the years ended december 31
2002 and 2001 respectively the 1076 million or 48 increase in revenue
from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our
operating and growth strategies described below the 1760 million or 621
increase in operating income from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributable to a
charge of 1320 million on a pretax basis that we recorded during the fourth
quarter of 2001 related to completed and planned divestitures and closings of
certain core and noncore businesses asset impairments downsizing our compost
mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments an increase in
selfinsurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the
economic slowdown the remaining increase in operating income of 440 million
is primarily attributable to the elimination of 430 million of goodwill
amortization upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no
142 goodwill and other intangible assets

     our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including
florida georgia nevada california and texas and in other domestic markets
that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past
several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our
presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates
that are generally higher than the industrys overall growth rate

     while we believe that we are well positioned to continue to increase our
revenue and operating income in the longer term the economic slowdown has had a
negative impact on certain aspects of our business however the aspects of our
business that we believe are recession resilient have continued to perform
well these include our residential and commercial collection operations which
are flatrate businesses and are not subject to the volatility we experience in
our industrial collection and disposal businesses we continue to focus on
enhancing stockholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth
strategies as described below

industry overview

     based on analysts reports and industry trade publications we believe that
the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generates annual
revenue of approximately 430 billion of which approximately 47 is generated
by publiclyowned waste companies 29 is generated by privatelyheld waste
companies and 24 is generated by municipal and other local governmental
authorities three companies generate the substantial majority of the
publiclyowned companies total revenue however according to industry data
the domestic nonhazardous waste industry remains highly fragmented as
privatelyheld companies and municipal and other local governmental authorities
generate approximately 53 of total industry revenue in general growth in the
solid waste industry is proportional to growth in the overall economy

                                        1

     the solid waste industry has experienced a period of rapid consolidation
during this time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions
however growth in the industry by virtue of acquisitions has slowed
considerably since late 1999 despite this we believe that the opportunity to
grow through acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than experienced
in previous years as a result of the following factors

          subtitle d regulation  subtitle d of the resource conservation and
     recovery act of 1976 as currently in effect and similar state regulations
     have significantly increased the amount of capital technical expertise
     operating costs and financial assurance obligations required to own and
     operate a landfill and other solid waste facilities many of the smaller
     participants in our industry have found these costs difficult if not
     impossible to bear large publiclyowned companies like our company have
     greater access to and a lower cost of the capital necessary to finance
     such increased capital expenditures and costs relative to many of the
     privatelyowned companies in the industry additionally the required
     permits for landfill development expansion or construction have become
     more difficult timeconsuming and costly to acquire consequently many
     smaller independent operators have decided to either close their
     operations or sell them to larger operators that have greater access to
     capital

          integration of solid waste businesses  by being able to control the
     waste stream in a market through the collection transfer and disposal
     process integrated solid waste companies gain a further competitive
     advantage over nonintegrated operators the ability of the integrated
     companies to both collect and dispose of solid waste coupled with access
     to significant capital resources necessary for acquisitions has created an
     environment in which large publiclyowned integrated companies can operate
     more cost effectively and competitively than nonintegrated operators

          municipal privatization  the trend toward consolidation in the solid
     waste services industry is further supported by the increasing tendency of
     a number of municipalities to privatize their waste disposal operations
     privatization of municipal waste operations is often an attractive
     alternative to funding the changes required by subtitle d

     these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of
viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous
privatelyheld companies in the industry have contributed to the overall
consolidation trend in the solid waste industry

financial strategy

     a key component of our financial strategy is our ability to generate free
cash flow our definition of free cash flow is cash provided by operating
activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale
of equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows we
believe that free cash flow is the best measure of our financial performance
because strong sustainable free cash flow is indicative of high quality
earnings consequently we have developed incentive programs and we conduct
monthly field operating reviews that help focus our entire company on the
importance of increasing free cash flow

     we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital
expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing
business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital
which consists primarily of accounts receivable and accounts payable

     we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder
value as well as our return on investment this includes the following

      customer service  we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of
       vehicles equipment landfills and facilities to ensure a high level of
       service to our customers

      internal growth  growth through increases in our customer base and
       services provided is the most capital efficient means for us to build our
       business this includes not only investing in trucks and containers but
       also includes investing in information tools and training needed to
       ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional
       areas of our business

      strategic acquisitions  we have and will continue to pursue strategic
       acquisitions that augment our existing business platform
                                        2
page

      share repurchase  if we are unable to identify opportunities that
       satisfy our growth strategy we intend to use our free cash flow to
       repurchase shares of our common stock at prices that provide value to our
       stockholders as of december 31 2002 we repurchased a total of 172
       million shares or approximately 10 of our common stock outstanding at
       the commencement of our share repurchase program in 2000 for 3001
       million in october 2002 our board of directors authorized the
       repurchase of up to an additional 1500 million of our common stock we
       believe that our share repurchase program will continue to enhance
       stockholder value

      dividends  depending upon the availability of strategic acquisitions in
       addition to using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common
       stock we may consider declaring a cash dividend if we believe that it
       will enhance stockholder value

      minimize borrowings  to the extent that the opportunities to enhance
       stockholder value mentioned above are not available we also intend to
       continue to use our free cash flow to minimize our borrowings

     another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an
investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure
favorable longterm fixedrate financing that reduces our exposure to changing
interest rates this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to
readily access capital markets

     for certain risks related to our financial strategy see risk factors

operating strategy

     we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase
operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy to
accomplish this goal is to

      utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive
       management

      utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing daytoday
       operations

      integrate waste operations

      improve operating margins through economies of scale cost efficiencies
       and asset utilization

      achieve high levels of customer satisfaction and

      utilize systems to improve consistency in financial and operational
       performance

     for certain risks related to our operating strategy see risk factors

       the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste
       industry

     waste industry our five regional vice presidents and our 23 area
     presidents have an average of 22 years of experience in the industry

          in addition our former chairman and a current director h wayne
     huizenga has over 28 years of experience in the solid waste industry
     after several years of owning and operating private waste collection
     companies in florida he cofounded waste management in 1971 from 1971 to
     1984 he served in various executive capacities with waste management
     including president and chief operating officer by then waste management
     had become the worlds largest integrated solid waste services company
     furthermore harris w hudson who has served as our vice chairman since
     our initial public offering has over 38 years of experience in the solid
     waste industry including 11 years with waste management and 19 years with
     private waste collection companies

      decentralized management structure  we maintain a relatively small
       corporate headquarters staff relying on a decentralized management
       structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our
       daytoday operations more efficiently our local management has
       extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid
       waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic
       markets in early 2001 we added a sales maintenance and operations
       manager to each of our regional management teams which previously
       consisted of a regional vice president and a regional controller we
       believe that strengthening our regional management teams allows us to
       more effectively and efficiently drive our companys initiatives and
       helps ensure consistency throughout our organization our regional
       management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority
       responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective
       geographic markets compensation for regional and area management teams
       is primarily based on the improvement in operating income produced and
       the cash flow generated in each managers geographic area of
       responsibility in addition through longterm incentive programs
       including stock options we believe we have one of the lowest turnover
       levels in the industry for our local management teams as a result of
       retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and
       involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating
       our customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also
       seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas
       throughout our operations to improve operating margins

      integrated operations  we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization
       by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through
       disposal we expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have
       a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our
       nonintegrated markets through acquisitions and other market development
       activities we create marketspecific integrated operations typically
       consisting of one or more collection companies transfer stations and
       landfills we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills
       with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of
       waste volume we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in
       markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate
       internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills
       and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in
       which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we
       determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the three months
       ended december 31 2002 approximately 53 of the total volume of waste
       that we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate in a
       number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take
       waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities this provides us with
       an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing
       in landfill capacity because we do not have landfill facilities or
       governmentcontrolled disposal facilities for all markets in which we
       provide collection services we believe that through landfill and
       transfer station acquisitions and development we have the opportunity to
       increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our
       operations by further integrating operations in existing markets through
       acquisitions and development of landfills and transfer stations we are
       able to reduce our disposal costs

      economies of scale cost efficiencies and asset utilization to improve
       operating margins our management focuses on achieving economies of scale
       and cost efficiencies the consolidation of acquired businesses into
       existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used
       for routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories
       and backoffice administration generally we consolidate our acquired
       administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative

                                        4
page

       costs our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative
       costs in the range of 10 of revenue which we feel is appropriate given
       our existing business platform in addition our size allows our company
       to negotiate volume discounts for certain purchases including waste
       disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties furthermore we
       have taken steps to increase utilization of our assets for example to
       reduce the number of collection vehicles and maximize the efficiency of
       our fleet we have instituted a grid productivity program which allows us
       to benchmark the performance of all of our drivers in our larger
       markets we also use a route optimization program to minimize drive times
       and improve operating density by using assets more efficiently
       operating expenses can be significantly reduced

      high levels of customer satisfaction  our goal of maintaining high
       levels of customer satisfaction complements our operating strategy our
       personalized sales process is oriented towards maintaining relationships
       and ensuring that service is being properly provided

      utilize systems to improve consistency in financial and operational
       reporting we continue to focus on systems and training initiatives that
       complement our operating strategy these initiatives include contact
       management billing productivity maintenance and general ledger
       systems these systems provide us with detailed information prepared in
       a consistent manner that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon
       trends in our business

growth strategy

     our strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and
enhancing stockholder value through internal growth and acquisitions for
certain risks related to our growth strategy see risk factors

      internal growth  our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining
       existing customers and obtaining commercial municipal and industrial
       customers through our wellmanaged sales and marketing activities

          longterm contracts  we seek to obtain longterm contracts for
     collecting solid waste in highgrowth markets these include exclusive
     franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and
     industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the
     opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
     underlying population growth in these markets for example we have secured
     exclusive longterm franchise agreements in highgrowth markets such as
     los angeles orange and contra costa counties in california las vegas
     nevada arlington texas and many areas of florida we believe that this
     positions our company to experience internal growth rates that are
     generally higher than our industrys overall growth rate in addition we
     believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growth
     markets we are better able to protect our market position from competition
     and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in economic
     conditions

          sales and marketing activities  we seek to manage our sales and
     marketing activities to enable our company to capitalize on our leading
     positions in many of the markets in which we operate we currently have
     approximately 500 sales and marketing employees in the field who are
     compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating high
     levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees directly
     solicit business from existing and prospective commercial industrial
     municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and cost
     structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in addition we
     utilize a contact management system that assists our sales people in
     tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial
     industrial and franchise contracts

      acquisition growth  during the late 1990s the solid waste industry
       experienced a period of rapid consolidation we were able to grow
       significantly through acquisitions during this period however the rate
       of consolidation in the industry has slowed considerably despite this
       we continue to look to acquire businesses that complement our existing
       business platform our acquisition growth strategy focuses on
       privatelyheld solid waste companies and municipal and other local
       governmental authorities we believe that our ability to acquire
       privatelyheld companies is enhanced by increasing competition in the
       solid waste industry increasing capital requirements as a result of
       changes in solid

                                        5
page

       waste regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies
       for these privatelyheld companies owners and principals we also seek
       to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are
       privatizing which occurs for many of the same reasons that
       privatelyheld companies sell their solid waste businesses in addition
       we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and
       facilities that may be divested by other publiclyowned waste companies
       in sum our acquisition growth strategy focuses on

           acquiring businesses that position our company for growth in
            existing and new markets

           acquiring wellmanaged companies and when appropriate retaining
            local management

           acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
            privatizing and publiclyowned companies that are divesting of
            assets

          for certain risks involved with our acquisition growth strategy see
     risk factors  we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth
     strategy   we may be unable to manage our growth effectively and
       businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities

          acquire businesses positioning the company for growth  in making
     acquisitions we principally target high quality businesses that will allow
     our company to be or provide our company favorable prospects of becoming
     a leading provider of integrated solid waste services in markets with
     favorable demographic growth generally we have acquired and will
     continue to seek to acquire solid waste collection transfer and disposal
     companies that

           have strong operating margins

           are in growth markets

           are among the largest or have a significant presence in their local
            markets and

           have longterm contracts or franchises with municipalities and other
            customers

     once we have a base of operations in a particular market we focus on
     acquiring trucks and routes of smaller businesses that also operate in that
     market and surrounding markets which are typically referred to as
     tuckin acquisitions we seek to consolidate the operations of such
     tuckin businesses into our existing operations in that market we also
     seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that
     operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully
     integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have
     in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with
     other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our
     business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and
     market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and
     consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost
     efficiencies and economies of scale

          acquire wellmanaged companies  we also seek to acquire businesses
     that have experienced management teams that are willing to join the
     management of our company we generally seek to maintain continuity in
     management of larger acquired companies in order to capitalize on their
     local market knowledge community relations and name recognition and to
     instill their entrepreneurial drive at all levels of our operations by
     furnishing the local management of such acquired companies with our
     financial and marketing resources and technical expertise we believe that
     the acquired companies are better able to secure additional municipal
     franchises and other contracts

          privatize municipal operations and acquire divested operations we
     also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations transfer stations
     and landfills that municipalities and other governmental authorities are
     privatizing many municipalities are seeking to outsource or sell these
     types of solid waste operations as they lack the capital technical
     expertise andor operational resources necessary to comply with
     increasingly stringent regulatory standards andor to compete effectively
     with privatesector companies in addition we have acquired and will
     continue to seek to acquire operations and facilities that may be divested
     by other publiclyowned waste companies

                                        6

operations

     our operations primarily consist of the collection and disposal of
nonhazardous solid waste

     collection services  we provide solid waste collection services to
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 22 states through
142 collection companies in 2002 75 of our revenue was derived from
collection services consisting of approximately 30 from services provided to
municipal and residential customers 39 from services provided to commercial
customers and 31 from services provided to industrial and other customers

     our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of
refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer
stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services
are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally
secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service
all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts
or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of
our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods residential solid
waste collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in
which individual households contract directly with our company the fees
received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on market
factors frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility
and cost of disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are
paid quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service

     in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our
customers with waste containers of varying sizes we also rent compactors to
large waste generators commercial collection services are generally performed
under one to threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by such
considerations as

      market factors

      collection frequency

      type of equipment furnished

      the type and volume or weight of the waste collected

      the distance to the disposal facility and

      the cost of disposal

     we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste
collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual
basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a
landfill or a transfer station for disposal

     we own or operate 90 transfer stations we deposit waste at these stations
as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer
to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities

     also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily
to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these
services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the
provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial
customers

     disposal services  as of december 31 2002 we owned or operated 56
landfills which had approximately 7697 permitted acres and total available
permitted and probable expansion disposal capacity of approximately 17 billion
inplace cubic yards the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to
change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities and
the ability to expand our sites successfully some of our landfills accept
nonhazardous special waste including utility ash asbestos and contaminated
soils see  properties

     most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded
disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the
availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and
evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood
of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand

                                        7
page

we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our
landfills although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be
permitted as designed

     other services  we have 33 materials recovery facilities and other
recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations
under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these
facilities primarily sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential
collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid
waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and non
recyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to
third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or
incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to
fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing third party facilities
thereby minimizing our recycling investment

     we provide remediation and other heavy construction services primarily
through our subsidiary located in missouri during march 2001 this subsidiary
agreed to act as a subcontractor on a project awarded by the army corps of
engineers to dredge a portion of the blue river revenue from this contract
which was completed in 2002 was approximately 90 million during 2002 our
subsidiary was awarded a contract to assist on the riverside levy project in
missouri revenue from this project which is scheduled to be completed in 2004
is expected to be approximately 500 million of which approximately 170 has
already been recorded

     we also have a texas based compost mulch and soil business at which yard
mill and other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products

sales and marketing

     we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to
maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a
broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience
stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding
business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers

     we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and
marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste
collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at
competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small
quantity generators to large fortune 500 companies and municipalities

     most of our marketing activity is local in nature however in 2000 we
initiated a national accounts program in response to our customers needs

     we generally do not change the tradenames of the local businesses we
acquire and therefore we do not operate nationally under any one mark or
tradename rather we rely on the goodwill associated with the acquired
companies local tradenames as used in each geographic market in which we
operate

customers

     we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential
customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of the
consolidated revenue of any of our reportable segments in any of the last three
years

competition

     we operate in a highly competitive industry entry into our business and
the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts
of capital and managerial experience

     competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few
large national publiclyowned companies including waste management and allied
waste industries several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste
companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies some of our
competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly
greater financial resources than
                                        8
page

we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies
we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal
operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the
availability of tax revenues and taxexempt financing

     we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the
quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price
of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively
bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and
profitability

     in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for
landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographical location and
quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by
the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to
which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the
state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit
the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills this
may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain
areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full
capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal
services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have
adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of
certain solid waste items to be recycled

regulation

     our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state
and local requirements that regulate the environment public health safety
zoning and land use operating and other permits licenses and other approvals
are generally required for landfills and transfer stations certain solid waste
collection vehicles fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or
operate and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal
in certain circumstances federal state and local laws and regulations vary
but generally govern wastewater or stormwater discharges air emissions the
handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and
nonhazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the
release or threatened release of hazardous substances these laws and
regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement
which include the ability to obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties
in the case of violations including criminal penalties the us environmental
protection agency and various other federal state and local environmental
public and occupational health and safety agencies and authorities administer
these regulations including the occupational safety and health administration
of the us department of labor

     we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental
concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from
governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for
remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities
there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the
future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established a reserve
that we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to
cover any potential regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual
costs will not exceed our reserve

     federal regulation  the following summarizes the primary environmental
public and occupational health and safetyrelated statutes of the united states
that affect our facilities and operations

          1 the solid waste disposal act as amended including the resource
     conservation and recovery act  rcra and its implementing regulations
     establish a framework for regulating the handling transportation
     treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid
     wastes and require states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal
     of solid waste in sanitary landfills

          subtitle d of rcra establishes a framework for regulating the disposal
     of municipal solid waste regulations under subtitle d currently include
     minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines
     including location restrictions facility design and operating criteria
     closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance standards
     groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards many
     of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the past in
     connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was required to
     submit to the us epa a

                                        9
page

     permit program designed to implement subtitle d regulations by april 9
     1993 all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit
     programs pursuant to rcra and subtitle d these state permit programs may
     include landfill requirements which are more stringent than those of
     subtitle d

          all of our planned landfill expansions or new landfill development
     projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements
     operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to
     comply with these new regulations compliance with subtitle d regulations
     has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require substantial
     additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with
     our waste management activities

          2 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
     liability act of 1980 as amended  cercla among other things provides
     for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened
     release of a hazardous substance into the environment cercla may impose
     strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for
     damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of the site
     parties who were owners or operators of the site at the time the hazardous
     substances were disposed of parties who transported the hazardous
     substances to the site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the
     hazardous substances at the site under the authority of cercla and its
     implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to the manner and
     degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where
     hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the
     environment liability under cercla is not dependent upon the existence or
     disposal of only hazardous wastes but can also be based upon the
     existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances characterized
     by the us epa as hazardous many of which may be found in common
     household waste

          among other things cercla authorizes the federal government to
     investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or
     are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer an
     opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous
     substances to do so in addition the us epa has established a national
     priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been or are
     threatened to be released and which require investigation or cleanup

          liability under cercla is not dependent upon the intentional disposal
     of hazardous wastes or hazardous substances it can be founded upon the
     release or threatened release even as a result of unintentional
     nonnegligent or lawful action of thousands of hazardous substances
     including very small quantities of such substances thus even if our
     landfills have never knowingly received hazardous wastes as such it is
     possible that one or more hazardous substances may have been deposited or
     released at our landfills or at other properties which we currently own
     or operate or may have owned or operated therefore we could be liable
     under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous substances at such
     sites and for damages to natural resources even if those substances were
     deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them the costs
     of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given the difficulty of
     obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability such liability
     could have a material impact on our business and financial condition for a
     further discussion see liability insurance and bonding

          3 the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended this
     act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources
     including solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters
     of the united states point source runoff from our landfills and transfer
     stations that is discharged into surface waters must be covered by
     discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and
     monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of
     pollutants in those discharges storm water discharge regulations under
     this act require a permit for certain construction activities and
     discharges from industrial operations and facilities which may affect our
     operations if a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through
     a sewage system to a publiclyowned treatment works the facility must
     comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works in addition
     states may adopt groundwater protection programs under this act or the safe
     drinking water act that could affect solid waste landfills furthermore
     development which alters or affects wetlands must generally be permitted

                                        10
page

     prior to such development commencing and certain mitigation requirements
     may be required by the permitting agencies

          4 the clean air act as amended  the clean air act imposes
     limitations on emissions from various sources including landfills in
     march 1996 the us epa promulgated regulations that require large
     municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems
     these regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction
     reconstruction or modification on or after may 30 1991 and principally
     to landfills that can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of
     municipal solid waste the regulations apply whether the landfill is active
     or closed the date by which each affected landfill is required to have a
     gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies
     depending upon calculated emission rates at the landfill many state
     regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the
     collection and control of certain landfill gas we do not expect that
     compliance with any new state regulations will have a material effect on
     us

          5 the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended  this
     act authorizes the occupational safety and health administration of the
     us department of labor to promulgate occupational safety and health
     standards a number of these standards including standards for notices of
     hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos apply to our facilities
     and operations

     state regulation  each state in which we operate has its own laws and
regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in
most cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such
matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation
maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and
operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition
our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend
in many states toward requiring the development of solid waste reduction and
recycling programs for example several states have enacted laws that require
counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through solid
waste planning composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid
waste deposited in landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the
disposal of certain wastes including yard waste newspapers beverage
containers unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances in
solid waste landfills have been promulgated in several states and are being
considered in others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or
encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also are or have
been under consideration by the us congress and the us epa respectively

     in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more
construction or operating permits as well as zoning and land use approvals
must be obtained these are difficult and timeconsuming to obtain are often
opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens groups may be subject to
periodic renewal and are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing
agency in connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and
on occasion has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time
effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with
applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to
increase their capacity

     many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are
generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally
subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their
periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of
leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe
that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable
regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the
leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response
costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating
that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks
will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

     finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are
subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are
regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and
by regulatory agencies in each state various states have enacted or
promulgated or are considering enacting or promulgating laws and regulations
that would restrict the interstate transportation and processing of solid waste
in 1978 the us supreme court ruled that a law that restricts the importation
of outofstate solid waste was unconstitutional however states have attempted
to distinguish proposed laws
                                        11
page

from that involved in and implicated by that ruling in 1994 the supreme court
ruled that a flow control law which attempted to restrict solid waste from
leaving its place of generation imposed an impermissible burden upon interstate
commerce and therefore was unconstitutional however states have also
attempted to distinguish proposed laws from that involved in and implicated by
that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings the us congress has
considered passing legislation authorizing states and local governments to
restrict the free movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal
legislation authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free
movement of solid waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation
could adversely affect our operations

     we have established a reserve for landfill and environmental costs which
includes landfill site closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess
such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace
and the technical requirements of subtitle d of rcra and adjust our rates used
to expense closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current
information and regulatory requirements we believe that our reserves for such
landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate however environmental
laws may change and there can be no assurance that our reserves will be
adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and
regulations future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations
or the identification of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to
us see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations  landfill and environmental matters and risk
factors  compliance with environmental regulation may impede our growth

liability insurance and bonding

     the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities
arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment
such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation
costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases
where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of
employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage
occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the
planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and
criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory
requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental
damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our
solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with
limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain
limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of
such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major
loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental
liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such
coverage costs prohibitive

     we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices
liability pollution liability directors and officers liability workers
compensation and employers liability coverage as well as umbrella liability
policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in
these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to
operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and
exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we
will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

     our insurance programs for workers compensation general liability
vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively
selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured
subject to policy limits accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of
claims incurred but not reported

     in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance
bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash deposits in connection
with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or
postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental
permits and certain business licenses and permits bonds issued by surety
companies operate as a financial guarantee

                                        12

of our performance to date we have satisfied financial responsibility
requirements by making cash deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit
insurance policies or surety bonds

employees

     as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 12700 fulltime
employees approximately 3300 of whom were covered by collective bargaining
agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our
employees

compensation

     we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and
corporate management team with the companys overall goal of generating
increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and
returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable
metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are
based upon free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each
managers geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure
that these individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company incentive
compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our companys
overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also
participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our
companys short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success
of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

corporate history

     we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 by our former parent
company autonation inc in 1998 autonation separated its nonhazardous solid
waste services division from its other businesses and we completed an initial
public offering of shares of our common stock in 1999 autonation sold
substantially all of its remaining interest in our company in a secondary public
offering

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete
effectively

     we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our
competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly
greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is
constantly changing as a result of rapid consolidation which may create
additional competitive pressures in our business environment

     we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste
collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial
advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt
financing

     we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the
quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of
their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win a
competitively bid municipal contract

     in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid
waste volume on the basis of disposal or tipping fees geographical location
and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our
landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection companies also
own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in markets in which we
do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations may operate at a
disadvantage to fully integrated competitors

     as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively
from time to time

economic conditions may continue to adversely affect our business operations
and internal growth

     during 2001 the economic slowdown reduced recycling commodity prices which
negatively impacted our operating margins the economic slowdown also negatively
impacted the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and the
nonresidential construction industry landfill volumes attributable to
manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken furthermore the
portion of our business that services the residential construction industry was
negatively impacted toward the latter part of 2001 during 2002 landfill
volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to
weaken a continued slowdown in the economy could further adversely affect
volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal
operations

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business

     our operations are dependent upon fuel which we purchase in the open
market on a daily basis during 2000 we experienced an increase in the cost of
fuel a portion of this increase was passed on to our customers to date in
2003 we have experienced a significant increase in the cost of fuel however
because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be no
assurances that we will be able to pass on the recent or any future increases in
fuel prices to our customers due to prospects of war and political instability
in oil producing countries fuel prices may continue to increase significantly
in 2003 a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our
business

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy

     our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability
to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating
process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our
control

     our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate
sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business to fund our internal
growth to acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common
stock minimize our borrowings and take other actions to enhance stockholder
value we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow to
execute our financial strategy that we will be able to repurchase our common
stock or that we will declare any cash dividends

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy

     our ability to execute our growth strategy still depends in part on our
ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our
ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the
consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies
including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities
the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings
economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant
challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the
same time in short we cannot assure you that

      desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified

      we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified

      we will effectively consolidate companies which are acquired and fully or
       timely realize the expected cost savings economies of scale or business
       efficiencies or

      any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings

     additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy
our acquisition strategy requires spending significant amounts of capital if we
are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may
need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a
material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among
our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase
prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor
prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the
aforementioned factors force us to alter our growth strategy our financial
condition results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely
affected

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively

     our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial
operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will
need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments
in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and
train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations
and systems to the extent and in the time required

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities

     in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition
candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the
acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities
as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we
typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining
indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment
of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by
acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be
able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or
sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed
liabilities arising from our acquisitions

we depend on key personnel

     our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key
employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on
any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers
whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to
attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects

                                        15

compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations may impede our
growth

     we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our
facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating
health safety environment zoning land use and transportation in addition
some of our waste operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely
affected if the federal government or the state or locality in which these
waste operations are located imposes fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits
the transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more
stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental
compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of
unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of
future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we
currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the
past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible
party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental
conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of
operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or
our loss of significant permits or licenses could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or
prospects

regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may
be delayed or denied

     our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well
as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills
and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens groups
and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these
challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated
with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition
failure to receive regulatory approval may prohibit us from establishing new
facilities and expanding existing facilities

our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may
differ from actual results

     our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include
amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could
differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and
assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and
amortization of landfill development costs accruals for closure and
postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities
for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for
environmental remediation deferred taxes and selfinsurance

     we currently accrue for landfill closure and postclosure costs based on
consumption of landfill airspace as of december 31 2002 assuming that all
available landfill capacity is used we expect to expense approximately 5413
million of landfill closure and postclosure costs over the remaining lives of
these facilities we cannot assure you that our reserves for landfill and
environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing
environmental regulations future changes or interpretations of existing
regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions
previously unknown to us

seasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations

     our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather
which could delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of
waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites
and other facilities

we may be unable to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit
facility

     we have a revolving shortterm credit facility in the principal amount of
3000 million which expires in july 2003 we anticipate extending the maturity
of this credit facility until july 2004 however we cannot assure you that we
will receive such extension and if so whether such extension will be on terms
as favorable to us as those currently contained in the credit facility

the outcome of audits by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our
company

     through the date of our initial public offering in july 1998 we filed
consolidated federal income tax returns with autonation the internal revenue
service is auditing autonations consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1995
through 1999 in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we have with
autonation we may be liable for certain assessments imposed by the internal
revenue service for the periods through june 1998 resulting from this audit in
addition the internal revenue service is auditing our consolidated tax returns
for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 no assurance can be given with respect to the
outcome of this audit or the effect it may have on us or that our reserves with
respect thereto are adequate a significant assessment against us could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash
flows

     you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual
report on form 10k

2002 financial objectives

     in january 2002 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these
objectives included the following

      increasing free cash flow by over 10

      growing revenue by 15 to 20 with 10 from price increases and 5
       to 10 from volume growth

      generating earnings per share of 137 to 139

      using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic
       acquisitions and repurchasing up to 1250 million of our stock

2002 business performance

     we exceeded all four of our financial objectives for 2002 despite a weak
economy

     the economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact
the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and
nonresidential construction activity during 2002 volumes attributable to
manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002

     despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted
above our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 30 with 14 from
price increases and 16 from volume growth during 2002 we secured several
longterm franchise and municipal contracts we also benefited from the
geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets as a result
during 2002 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established
at the beginning of the year

     in addition to the impact of the economic slowdown discussed above during
2002 our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased costs for
risk and health insurance increased depreciation expense primarily associated
with capital additions and increased revenue from municipal contracts and
transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business

     this decrease in operating margins was partially offset by an increase in
recycling commodity prices a decrease in fuel costs and the termination of our
operating lease facility during 2001 we began a number of initiatives designed
to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a
number of management information systems such as route optimization customer
relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software we continued to
realize benefits from these initiatives in 2002

     notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in
certain expenses our earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2002
was 142 excluding a gain on sale of certain assets which exceeded the
objective we established at the beginning of the year we were also able to
exceed our free cash flow objective for the year

     during 2002 our board of directors increased our previously authorized
share repurchase program from 1250 million to 1500 million we used our free
cash flow during 2002 to repurchase 80 million shares of our common stock for
1500 million

                                        22

2003 financial objectives

     our financial objectives for 2003 assume no deterioration or improvement in
the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2002
specific guidance is as follows

      our goal is to generate free cash flow of approximately 900 of 2003 net
       income we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities
       less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of
       equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows

      we anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common
       stock under our 1500 million share repurchase program approved by our
       board of directors in october 2002

      we anticipate earnings per share of 146 to 148 including an
       estimated 03 of additional landfill costs associated with the adoption
       of statement of financial accounting standards no 143 accounting for
       asset retirement obligations and a change in accounting associated with
       methane gas collection systems

      we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 20 to 30
       with approximately 10 to 15 attributable to price increases and 10
       to 15 attributable to volume growth

business initiatives

     our business initiatives for 2003 are generally a continuation of those
initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business
processes and improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our
initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the
overall success of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2003 are as
follows

      improve the quality of our revenue  the first step in this process was
       completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and
       operating system this system enables us to among other things stratify
       our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market
       pricing during 2002 we implemented the second generation of this
       software which we call rsi 10 rsi 10 our companys core business
       system provides a variety of functionalities including customer service
       dispatch billing sales analysis account retention and route
       productivity analysis

      we currently monitor our return on investment by market place and are in
      the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model this
      model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by
      customer

      during 2001 we also implemented a customer relationship management
      system this system improves the productivity of our sales force by
      helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads it also
      tracks renewal periods for potential commercial industrial and franchise
      contracts our focus during 2003 will be to ensure our sales force is
      properly trained on this system and using it as intended

      improve the productivity of our operations  we have instituted a grid
       productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our
       drivers in addition in our larger markets we use a route optimization
       program to minimize drive times and improve operational density during
       2003 we will continue to update our disposal optimization reviews these
       reviews determine which local disposal option maximizes our return on
       invested capital and cash flow

      improve fleet management and procurement  in february 2002 we selected
       dossier as our fleet management and procurement system among other
       features this system will track parts inventories generate automatic
       quantity order points and log all maintenance work it will allow us to
       capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance
       programs comply with manufacturers warranties in addition the purchase
       order module within this system will allow us to crossreference
       purchasing information with our inventory we expect to have dossier
       implemented at all of our hauling and landfill operations by the end of
       2003

      enhance operational and financial reporting systems  we currently have
       several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and
       financial reporting systems the overall goal of these initiatives
                                        23
page

       is to provide us with detailed information prepared in a consistent
       manner that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our
       business

      the most significant of these systems is our enterprisewide general
      ledger package we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson
      general ledger software in 2002 and we are currently in the process of
      converting all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software

      all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more
      consistent and detailed information thus allowing us to make quicker and
      more informed business decisions in addition during 2001 all of our
      significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our
      data center in fort lauderdale florida this standardization and
      centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our
      operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines it
      also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery
      plan if necessary

      expand our safety training programs  as part of our ongoing emphasis on
       safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance
       costs we expanded our safety training programs in 2002 we have signed a
       multiyear agreement with dupont safety resources to assist in
       successfully completing this initiative

     our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and
commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm
contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial
collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to
three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping
fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations
with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable
materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 5 of our
consolidated revenue in any of the last three years

     the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes
disposal labor fuel and equipment maintenance costs we try to be more
efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of

                                        24
page

collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2002
approximately 53 of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at
landfills we own or operate

     our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses costs of
capital for cell development accruals for closure and postclosure costs and
the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance we
expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use
life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain
direct landfill costs in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are
capitalized or accrued and charged to expense based upon the consumption of
cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire
construct close and maintain a site during the postclosure period

     cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers
together with our engineers these estimates are used by our operating and
accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized
costs and accrue closure and postclosure costs changes in these estimates
primarily relate to changes in available airspace inflation and applicable
regulations changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes
due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a
probable likelihood of being permitted

critical accounting policies and disclosures

     our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include
certain estimates and judgments made by management in the past we
significantly expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that
require subjective or complex judgments including landfill accounting fixed
assets and the activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and
postclosure accruals selfinsurance reserves and allowance for doubtful
accounts as part of our continuing commitment to reliable and transparent
financial reporting that allows the users of our financial statements to make
more informed decisions we have prepared the following list of accounting
policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys
financial condition results of operations and cash flows and may require
management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are
inherently uncertain

     the following policies related to our landfill accounting are effective
through december 31 2002 on january 1 2003 certain of our policies will
change upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 143
accounting for asset retirement obligations see note 2 summary of
significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial
statements for further information

capitalized landfill costs when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of
assets purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted
expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within
the acquired group and is adjusted for other nondepletable landfill assets and
liabilities acquired primarily closure and postclosure liabilities landfill

a represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are
    passed on to customers

     the economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact
the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and
nonresidential construction industry during 2002 volumes attributable to
manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002

     the weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was
partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part
of 2002

     despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted
above our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 30 during 2002
we secured several longterm franchise and municipal contracts we also
benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth
markets

     during the first and second quarters of 2001 our revenue was negatively
impacted by weakness in recycling commodity prices in addition during the
second quarter of 2001 we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the
manufacturing sector particularly in the midwestern and midatlantic states

     during the third quarter of 2001 the economic slowdown began to impact our
industrial business servicing the nonresidential construction industry
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began
to weaken in addition the slowdown we began to experience in the second
quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we experienced
significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united
states particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the
carolinas these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers which
were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters

                                        32
page

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we continued to see a weakening in waste
volumes from the manufacturing sector we also continued to see a slowdown in
commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume
reductions and price sensitivity for these services furthermore we began to
see a softening in residential construction activity

     we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 20 to 30
during 2003 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from
that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2002 however our price and
volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2003 depending upon the severity
and duration of the economic slowdown

     cost of operations  cost of operations was 14729 million 14225
million and 12713 million or as a percentage of revenue 623 630 and
605 for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

     the increase in aggregate dollars from 2001 to 2002 is primarily a result
of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth
during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on an
aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax amount
242 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the
downsizing of our compost mulch and soil business and related inventory
adjustments and an increase in selfinsurance reserves

     excluding the impact of this charge cost of operations for 2001 was
13983 million or 619 as a percent of revenue the increase in adjusted
cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the
result of the economic slowdown higher costs for risk and health insurance and
increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have
higher operating costs these increases in cost of operations were partially
offset by improved operating efficiencies higher recycling commodity prices
lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility

     the increase in aggregate dollars from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result
of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth the
increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001
excluding the impact of the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 is
primarily a result of the economic slowdown lower recycling commodity prices
higher labor costs and higher costs for risk and health insurance partially
offset by improved operating efficiencies and revenue mix in addition during
the third quarter of 2001 we continued to be successful in attracting municipal
customers however these customers generally produce lower margins than other
customers

     to date in 2003 we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices
we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to
remain high or increase further depending upon the cost of fuel health
insurance risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the
severity and duration of the economic slowdown

     depreciation amortization and depletion of property and
equipment  depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and
equipment were 1935 million 1683 million and 1570 million or as a
percentage of revenue 82 74 and 75 for the years ended december 31
2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars for all
periods presented is primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures the
increase as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to higher
depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures acquisitions and the
purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating
lease the decrease as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily
due to lower depletion expense at our landfills resulting from higher compaction
and more cost efficient cell construction

     amortization of intangible assets  intangible assets consist primarily of
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired but also includes values
assigned to longterm contracts and covenants not to compete expenses for
amortization of intangible assets were 61 million 471 million and 404
million or as a percentage of revenue 2 21 and 19 for the years ended
december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in aggregate
dollars and as a percent of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the adoption of
statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets effective january 1 2002 under which most of our intangible
assets are no longer subject to amortization the
                                        33

increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001
is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of acquisitions
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

     selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and
administrative expenses were 2387 million 2365 million and 1939 million
or as a percentage of revenue 101 105 and 92 for the years ended
december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increases in aggregate
dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through
acquisitions and internal growth

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on
an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax
amount 82 million was recorded to selling general and administrative
expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting
from the economic slowdown excluding the impact of this charge selling
general and administrative expenses for 2001 were 2283 million or 101 as a
percent of revenue which is consistent with 2002 the increase in selling
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001
is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional management structure and
various systems and training initiatives we believe that selling general and
administrative expenses in the range of 10 of revenue is appropriate for 2003
given our business platform however selling general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending upon the severity and
duration of the economic slowdown

     other charges  during the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a 56
million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates
originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on
an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax
amount 996 million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to
completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and noncore
businesses and asset impairments

     other charges were 67 million for the year ended december 31 2000 these
charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south texas

     operating income  operating income was 4595 million 2835 million and
4340 million or as a percentage of revenue 194 126 and 206 for the
years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively excluding the impact
of the other charges income we recorded in the fourth quarters of 2002 and
2001 our operating income was 4539 million or 192 and 4155 million or
184 for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

     interest expense  we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit
facility unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 770
million 801 million and 816 million for the years ended december 31 2002
2001 and 2000 respectively the decrease in interest expense is due to a
general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in taxexempt
financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured
notes the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap
agreements that we entered into during 2001 and 2002

     capitalized interest was 25 million 33 million and 29 million for
the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

     interest and other income expense net  interest and other income net
of other expense was 40 million 59 million and 40 million for the years
ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the variances during the
periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash balances on hand and related
interest income and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2000 and 2001

     income taxes  our provision for income taxes was 1469 million 838
million and 1354 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively our effective income tax rate was 380 400 and 380 for the
years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in our
effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 is the result of certain nontaxdeductible
items included in the charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001
excluding the impact of this charge our effective tax rate for 2001 was 380

     consolidated results of operations  our net income for the year ended
december 31 2002 was 2396 million our adjusted net income was 2361 million
for the year ended december 31 2002 our adjusted operating results exclude a
56 million pretax or a 35 million aftertax gain we recorded during the
fourth quarter of 2002 on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding
estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001

landfill and environmental matters

     changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to
the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the
capacity calculations resulting from updated information changes in design
typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or
vertical slopes

     during 2000 we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted
in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was
consumed during 2001 total available airspace increased by 341 million cubic
yards primarily due to changes in design partially offset by consumption during
2002 total available airspace increased by 226 million cubic yards primarily
due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina and changes in
engineering estimates partially offset by consumption

     as of december 31 2002 we owned or operated 56 solid waste landfills with
total available disposal capacity estimated to be 17 billion inplace cubic
yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace these
estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our
engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys as of
december 31 2002 total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 14
billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 3 billion inplace
cubic yards of probable expansion airspace before airspace included in an
expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and therefore
included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity it must meet
our expansion criteria see note 4 accrued landfill environmental and legal
costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further
information

     as of december 31 2002 twenty of our landfills meet the criteria for
including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal
capacity at projected annual volumes these twenty landfills have an estimated
remaining average site life of 32 years including probable expansion airspace
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 34 years

     as of december 31 2002 five of our landfills that meet the criteria for
including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and
are proceeding into the state permitting process also as of december 31 2002
nine of our twenty landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion
airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities the remaining
six landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the
process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any
fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or
state level

  closure and postclosure costs

     the following table reflects our closure and postclosure expense per cubic
yard of airspace consumed for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000



                                                              2002    2001    2000

cubic yards of airspace consumed in millions   346    325    325
closure and postclosure expense per cubic yard   75    70    72


     as of december 31 2002 accrued closure and postclosure costs were 2558
million the current portion of these costs of 221 million is reflected in our
consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion
of these costs of 2337 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets
in accrued landfill environmental and legal costs as of december 31 2002
assuming that all available landfill capacity is used we expect to expense
approximately 5413 million of additional closure and postclosure costs over
the remaining lives of our facilities

     our estimates for closure and postclosure do not take into account
discounts for the present value of total estimated costs if total estimated
costs were discounted to present value they would be lower

     during 2002 our weighted average compaction rate for converting cubic
yards to tons was approximately 1500 pounds per cubic yard

     as of december 31 2002 we expect to spend an estimated additional
11464 million on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction
and environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total
expected gross investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 19
billion or 111 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and
amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption
method our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take
into account inflation or discounts for the present value of total estimated
costs for further information see closure and postclosure costs

     we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a
charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be
reasonably estimated we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation
activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as
a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill
purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate no material amounts were
charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000

financial condition

     one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple costeffective
and transparent capital structure

     at december 31 2002 we had 1415 million of cash and cash equivalents
we also had 1750 million of restricted cash of which 1397 million relates
to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financing that will be
used to fund capital expenditures at december 31 2002 we had 3782 million
of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financing outstanding at favorable
interest rates

     in july 1998 we entered into a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit
facility with a group of banks 5000 million of the credit facility was
scheduled to expire in july 2002 and the remaining 5000 million was scheduled
to expire in july 2003 as a result of our strong financial position and
liquidity in february 2002 we reduced the short and longterm portions of our
credit facility to 3000 million and 4500 million respectively in july
2002 we renewed the short and longterm portions of our credit facility on
substantially the same terms and conditions the shortterm portion of the
facility expires in july 2003 and the longterm portion expires in july 2007
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use
our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our
working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and other
requirements as of december 31 2002 we had 4377 million available under our
credit facility

     in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public
market 2250 million of these notes bear interest at 6 58 per annum and
mature in 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7 18 per annum
and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and
november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a
discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively proceeds from the notes
were used to repay our revolving credit facility

     in december 1999 we entered into an operating lease facility established
to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of
revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we exercised our right to purchase the
equipment underlying this facility by paying 726 million using our excess
cash which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time

     in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public
market the notes bear interest at 6 34 and mature in 2011 interest on these
notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were offered at
a discount of 26 million proceeds from the notes were used to repay our
revolving credit facility

     in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates in
september 2001 and october 2002 we entered into interest rate swap agreements
with investment grade rated financial institutions the swap agreements have
total notional values of 2250 million and 750 million respectively and
require our
                                        38
page

company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and
receive interest at fixed rates of 6 58 and 6 34 respectively the swap
agreements terminate in may 2004 and august 2011 respectively

     at december 31 2002 we had 3782 million of taxexempt bonds and other
taxexempt financings outstanding of which approximately 965 million was
obtained during fiscal 2002 borrowings under these bonds and other financings
bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market
ranging from 145 to 525 at december 31 2002 and have maturities ranging
from 2003 to 2032 as of december 31 2002 we had 1397 million of restricted
cash related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings
this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms
of the agreements

     we plan to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit facility
prior to its expiration in july 2003 to july 2004 we believe that such an
extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our
anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe
that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if
necessary to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions however
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under
favorable terms or to extend the existing shortterm credit facility on the same
terms

selected balance sheet accounts

     we were the first in our industry to provide the users of our financial
statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance sheet
accounts these additional disclosures include schedules that show the activity
in our available airspace investment in landfills property and equipment and
other selected balance sheet accounts we believe that these disclosures permit
the readers of our financial statements to gain a better understanding of our
companys financial condition results of operations and cash flows

2000 2001 and 2002 was 6 10 and 5 respectively

     as of december 31 2002 accounts receivable were 2386 million net of
allowance for doubtful accounts of 190 million resulting in days sales
outstanding of 36 days or 23 days net of deferred revenue in addition at
december 31 2002 our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled 138
million or 54 of gross receivables outstanding

     our expense for selfinsurance as a percentage of revenue for 2000 2001
and 2002 was 48 58 and 58 respectively the increases are primarily due

ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the changes in cash
provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of
our business deferred taxes and timing of receipts and payments from accounts
receivable and accounts payable respectively

     we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures
acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayments

acquisitions

     cash flows from used in financing activities  cash flows provided by
used in financing activities during the years ended december 31 2002 2001
and 2000 included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three
years proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in 2001 and proceeds from
issuances of taxexempt bonds in 2002 2001 and 2000 in august 2001 we sold
unsecured notes with a face value of 4500 million at a discounted price of
4474 million proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit
facility

     in december 1999 we entered into an operating lease facility established
to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of
revenueproducing vehicles in july 2002 we retired this facility using our
excess cash

     during 2000 2001 and 2002 our board of directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 1500 million 1250 million and 1750 million
respectively of our common stock as of december 31 2002 we paid 3001
million to repurchase approximately 172 million shares of our stock of which
we paid 1500 million during 2002 to repurchase approximately 80 million
shares of our stock we intend to finance future stock repurchases through cash
on hand cash flow from operations our revolving credit facility and other
financings

     we used proceeds from our revolving credit facility unsecured notes and
taxexempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay
debt

credit rating

     our company has received investment grade credit ratings as of december
31 2002 our senior debt was rated baa3 by moodys bbb by standard  poors
and bbb by fitch

     one of our key financial objectives is to maintain our investment grade
credit rating on our senior debt we believe that frequently communicating with
our rating agencies and providing them with detailed information concerning our
financial and operational performance is critical in achieving this objective

     the following table demonstrates our improvement in certain financial
ratios as of and for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 that we
believe are important to our credit rating agencies

b ebitda represents operating income plus depreciation amortization and
    depletion while ebitda data should not be construed as a substitute for
    operating income net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our
    operating performance financial position and cash flows we have included
    ebitda data which is not a measure of financial performance calculated in
    accordance with accounting

                                        42
page

    principles generally accepted in the united states because we believe that
    this data is commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a
    companys financial performance due to the fact that not all companies
    calculate nongaap measures in the same manner the ebitda presentation
    herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies

     we believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies
and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our
company

operating lease facility

     one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple costeffective
and transparent capital structure

     as we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the
securities and exchange commission in december 1999 we entered into a 1000
million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment
consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles the facility had a term of
three years with two consecutive oneyear renewals and was entered into
primarily because its implicit interest rate was over ten basis points less than
our revolving credit facility at the time the facility met the criteria of an
operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles accordingly
during the term of this facility we did not record this facility as debt nor
did we record the related operating equipment as assets on our balance sheets
however we included the cost of operating equipment acquired under the facility
as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash flow

     in july 2002 we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying
this facility by paying 726 million using our excess cash which was the
balance outstanding under the facility at that time as a result of our success
in obtaining financing in the public markets including taxexempt bonds we do
not anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future

fuel hedge

     we have minimized our risk associated with changes in the price of diesel
fuel by entering into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having
investment grade ratings our derivative instruments qualify for hedge
accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended
under these option agreements we receive or make payments based on the
difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed
prices these option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a
predetermined fixed price in the option agreements but also limit our ability
to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the
option agreements

     during june 2001 we entered into option agreements for approximately 143
million gallons of heating oil these option agreements settled each month in
equal notional amounts through december 2002 the option agreements were
structured as zerocost collars indexed to the price of heating oil the option
agreements expired in december 2002 in accordance with sfas 133 16 million
and 16 million net of tax representing the effective portion of the change
in fair value during the periods have been recorded in stockholders equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the years ended
december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the ineffective portions of the
changes in fair value of approximately 1 million and 1 million for the
years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively have been included in
other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income realized losses of 8 million and 6 million for the years ended
december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively related to these option agreements are
included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income

seasonality

     our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather
which could delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of
waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
other facilities

new accounting pronouncements

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no
143 accounting for asset retirement obligations this statement is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002
and applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible longlived assets sfas 143 will require our company to
change the methodology we currently use to record closure and postclosure costs
related to our landfills the most significant change to our methodology
promulgated by this statement is inflating and discounting obligations to
reflect todays dollars

     sfas 143 does not change the basic landfill accounting policies followed by
us and others in the waste industry in general the industry has amortized
capitalized costs and accrued future closure and postclosure obligations using
the unitsofconsumption method as cubic yards of available airspace are
consumed over the life of the related landfill this practice is referred to as
life cycle accounting and will continue to be followed except as modified by
sfas 143 as discussed below

                                        44
page

     under sfas 143 obligations associated with final capping activities that
occur during the operating life of the landfill will be recognized on a
unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping
event obligations related to closure and postclosure activities that occur
after the landfill has ceased operations will be recognized on a
unitsofconsumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire
landfill landfill retirement obligations will be capitalized as the related
liabilities are recognized and amortized using the unitsofconsumption method
over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed
throughout the entire landfill depending upon the nature of the obligation all
obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value fair value will
be calculated on a present value basis using the companys creditadjusted
riskfree rate

     upon adopting sfas 143 the company will no longer record closure and
postclosure expense as a component of cost of operations instead amortization
expense will be recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and
accretion expense will be recorded using the effective interest method

     the table below reflects significant changes between our current
methodology and the methodology we will use upon adopting sfas 143



                                                                       practice upon adoption of

item 1  business

company overview

     we are a leading provider of services in the domestic nonhazardous solid
waste industry we provide nonhazardous solid waste collection services for
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers through 146
collection companies in 22 states we also own or operate 89 transfer stations
54 solid waste landfills and 26 recycling facilities

     we had revenue of 22575 million and 21033 million and operating
income of 2835 million and 4340 million for the years ended december 31
2001 and 2000 respectively the 1542 million or 73 increase in revenue
from 2000 to 2001 is primarily attributable to the successful execution of the
operating and growth strategies described below the 1505 million decrease in
operating income is primarily due to a charge of 1320 million on a pretax
basis or 861 million on an aftertax basis recorded in the fourth quarter of
2001 for completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and
noncore businesses asset impairments downsizing our compost mulch and soil
business and related inventory adjustments an increase in insurance reserves
and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown the
economic slowdown also contributed to the decrease in operating income from 2000
to 2001

     our presence in high growth markets throughout the sunbelt including
florida georgia nevada california and texas and in other domestic markets
that have experienced higher than average population growth during the past
several years supports our internal growth strategy we believe that our
presence in these markets positions our company to experience growth at rates
that are generally higher than the industrys overall growth rate

     while we believe that we are well positioned to continue to increase our
revenue and operating income in the longerterm the economic slowdown has had a
negative impact on certain aspects of our business however the aspects of our
business that we believe are recession resilient have continued to perform
well this includes residential and commercial collection operations which are
flat rate businesses and are not subject to the volatility we experience in our
industrial collection and disposal business we continue to focus on enhancing
stockholder value by implementing our financial operating and growth strategies
as described below

industry overview

     based on analysts reports and industry trade publications we believe that
the united states nonhazardous solid waste services industry generated revenue
of approximately 43 billion in 1999 of which approximately 47 was generated
by publiclyowned waste companies 29 was generated by privatelyheld waste
companies and 24 was generated by municipal and other local governmental
authorities only three companies generated the substantial majority of the
publiclyowned companies total revenue in 1999 however according to industry
data the domestic nonhazardous waste industry remains highly fragmented as
privatelyheld companies and municipal and local governmental authorities
generated total annual revenue of approximately 23 billion in general growth
in the solid waste industry is proportional to growth in the overall economy

     the solid waste industry has experienced a period of rapid consolidation
during this time we were able to grow significantly through acquisitions
however growth in the industry by virtue of acquisitions has slowed
considerably despite this we believe that the opportunity to grow through
acquisitions still exists albeit at a slower pace than experienced in previous
years as a result of the following factors

          subtitle d regulation  subtitle d of the resource conservation and
     recovery act of 1976 as currently in effect and similar state regulations
     have significantly increased the amount of capital technical expertise
     operating costs and financial assurance obligations required to own and
     operate a landfill and other solid waste facilities many of the smaller
     participants in our industry have found these costs difficult if not
     impossible to bear large publiclyowned companies like our company have
     greater

                                        1
page

     access to and a lower cost of the capital necessary to finance such
     increased capital expenditures and costs relative to many of the
     privatelyowned companies in the industry additionally the required
     permits for landfill development expansion or construction have become
     more difficult time consuming and costly to acquire consequently many
     smaller independent operators have decided to either close their
     operations or sell them to larger operators with greater access to capital

          integration of solid waste businesses  by being able to control the
     waste stream in a market through the collection transfer and disposal
     process integrated solid waste companies gain a further competitive
     advantage over nonintegrated operators the ability of the integrated
     companies to both collect and dispose of solid waste coupled with access
     to significant capital resources necessary for acquisitions has created an
     environment in which large publiclyowned integrated companies can operate
     more cost effectively and competitively than nonintegrated operators

          municipal privatization  the trend toward consolidation in the solid
     waste services industry is further supported by the increasing tendency of
     a number of municipalities to privatize their waste disposal operations
     privatization of municipal waste operations is often an attractive
     alternative to funding the changes required by subtitle d

     these developments as well as the fact that there are a limited number of
viable exit strategies for many of the owners and principals of numerous
privatelyheld companies in the industry have contributed to the overall
consolidation trend in the solid waste industry

financial strategy

     a key component of our financial strategy is our ability to generate free
cash flow we use a simple definition  free cash flow is net income plus
depreciation depletion and amortization less capital expenditures plus or
minus net changes in assets and liabilities certain analysts that follow the
waste industry add deferred income taxes and proceeds from the sale of equipment
to our definition of free cash flow we believe that free cash flow is the best
measure of our financial performance because strong sustainable free cash flow
is indicative of high quality earnings consequently we have developed
incentive programs and monthly field operating reviews that help focus our
entire company on the importance of growing free cash flow

     we manage our free cash flow primarily by ensuring that capital
expenditures are appropriate in light of our internal and acquisition growth and
by closely managing our assets and liabilities the most critical of which are
accounts receivable and accounts payable

     we have used and will continue to use our cash flow to maximize stockholder
value as well as our return on investment this includes the following

      customer service  we will continue to reinvest in our existing fleet of
       vehicles equipment landfills and facilities to ensure a high level of
       service to our customers

      internal growth  growth through increases in our customer base and
       services provided is the most costeffective means for us to build our
       business this includes not only investing in trucks and containers but
       also includes investing in information tools and training needed to
       ensure high productivity and quality service throughout all functional
       areas of our business

      strategic acquisitions  we have and will continue to pursue strategic
       acquisitions that augment our existing business platform for example
       our acquisition of richmond sanitary services during 2001 complemented
       our business platform by providing us with a vertically integrated
       business in a growth market

      share repurchase  if we are unable to identify opportunities that
       satisfy our growth strategy we intend to use our free cash flow to
       repurchase shares of our common stock at prices that provide value to our
       stockholders as of december 31 2001 we repurchased 92 million shares
       of our common stock or approximately 54 of our shares outstanding at
       yearend for 1501 million our board of directors

                                        2
page

       has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 1250 million of
       our common stock we believe that our share repurchase program will
       continue to enhance stockholder value

      minimize borrowings  to the extent that the opportunities to enhance
       stockholder value mentioned above are not available we also intend to
       continue to use our free cash flow to minimize our borrowings under our
       revolving credit facility

     another key component of our financial strategy includes maintaining an
investment grade rating on our senior debt this has allowed us to secure
favorable longterm fixed rate financing that reduces our exposure to changing
interest rates this has also allowed us and will continue to allow us to
readily access capital markets

     for certain risks related to our financial strategy see risk factors

operating strategy

     we seek to leverage existing assets and revenue growth to increase
operating margins and enhance stockholder value our operating strategy to
accomplish this goal is to

      utilize the extensive industry knowledge and experience of our executive
       management

      utilize a decentralized management structure in overseeing daytoday
       operations

      integrate waste operations

      improve operating margins through economies of scale cost efficiencies
       and asset utilization

      achieve high levels of customer satisfaction and

      utilize systems to improve consistency in financial and operational
       performance

     for certain risks related to our operating strategy see risk factors

      experienced executive management team  we believe that we have one of
       the most experienced executive management teams in the solid waste
       industry

          h wayne huizenga who has served as our chairman since our initial
     public offering in july 1998 has over 27 years of experience in the solid
     waste industry after several years of owning and operating private waste
     hauling companies in florida he cofounded waste management in 1971 from
     1971 to 1984 he served in various executive capacities with waste
     management including president and chief operating officer by then waste
     management inc had become the worlds largest integrated solid waste
     services company

          harris w hudson who has served as our vice chairman since our
     initial public offering has over 37 years of experience in the solid waste
     industry mr hudson worked closely with mr huizenga from 1964 until
     1982 at waste management and at the private waste hauling firms they
     operated prior to the formation of waste management in 1982 mr hudson
     retired as vice president of waste management of florida inc a
     subsidiary of waste management in 1983 mr hudson founded hudson
     management corporation a solid waste collection company in florida and
     served as its chairman and chief executive officer until it merged with
     autonation in august 1995 by that time hudson management had grown to
     over 500 million in annual revenue becoming one of floridas largest
     privatelyheld solid waste collection companies based on revenue from
     august 1995 until our initial public offering mr hudson served in various
     capacities with autonation including chairman of its solid waste group

          james e oconnor who has served as our chief executive officer since
     december 1998 also worked at waste management from 1972 to 1978 and from
     1982 to 1998 during that time he served in various management positions
     including senior vice president in 1997 and 1998 and area president of
     waste management of florida inc from 1992 to 1997 mr oconnor has over
     27 years of experience in the solid waste industry

                                        3

         the other corporate officers with responsibility for our operations
      have an average of over 19 years of management experience in the solid
      waste industry our five regional vice presidents have an average of 23
      years of experience in the industry and our 22 area presidents have an
      average of 22 years of experience in the industry

      decentralized management structure  we maintain a relatively small
       corporate headquarters staff relying on a decentralized management
       structure to minimize administrative overhead costs and to manage our
       daytoday operations more efficiently our local management has
       extensive industry experience in growing operating and managing solid
       waste companies and has substantial experience in their local geographic
       markets in early 2001 we added a sales maintenance and operations
       manager to each of our regional management teams which previously
       consisted of a regional vice president and a regional controller we
       believe that strengthening our regional management teams allows us to
       more effectively and efficiently drive our companys initiatives and
       helps ensure consistency throughout our organization our regional
       management teams and our area presidents have extensive authority
       responsibility and autonomy for operations within their respective
       geographic markets compensation for regional and area management teams
       is primarily based on the improvement in operating income produced and
       the cash flow generated in each managers geographic area of
       responsibility in addition through longterm incentive programs
       including stock options we believe we have one of the lowest turnover
       levels in the industry for our local management teams as a result of
       retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and
       involvement in their local communities we are proactive in anticipating
       our customers needs and adjusting to changes in our markets we also
       seek to implement the best practices of our various regions and areas
       throughout our operations to improve operating margins

      integrated operations  we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization
       by controlling waste streams from the point of collection through
       disposal we expect that our fully integrated markets generally will have
       a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our
       nonintegrated markets through acquisitions and other market development
       activities we create market specific integrated operations typically
       consisting of one or more collection companies transfer stations and
       landfills we consider acquiring companies that own or operate landfills
       with significant permitted disposal capacity and appropriate levels of
       waste volume we also seek to acquire solid waste collection companies in
       markets in which we own or operate landfills in addition we generate
       internal growth in our disposal operations by developing new landfills
       and expanding our existing landfills from time to time in markets in
       which we have significant collection operations or in markets that we
       determine lack sufficient disposal capacity during the three months
       ended december 31 2001 approximately 52 of the total volume of waste
       that we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate in a
       number of our larger markets we and our competitors are required to take
       waste to governmentcontrolled disposal facilities this provides us with
       an opportunity to effectively compete in these markets without investing
       in landfill capacity because we do not have landfill facilities or
       governmentcontrolled disposal facilities for all markets in which we
       provide collection services we believe that through landfill and
       transfer station acquisitions and development we have the opportunity to
       increase our waste internalization rate and further integrate our
       operations by further integrating operations in existing markets through
       acquisitions and development of landfills and transfer stations we are
       able to reduce our disposal costs

      economies of scale cost efficiencies and asset utilization  to improve
       operating margins our management focuses on achieving economies of scale
       and cost efficiencies the consolidation of acquired businesses into
       existing operations reduces costs by decreasing capital and expenses used
       for routing personnel equipment and vehicle maintenance inventories
       and backoffice administration generally we consolidate our acquired
       administrative centers to reduce our general and administrative costs
       our goal is to maintain our selling general and administrative costs in
       the range of 10 of revenue which we feel is appropriate given our
       existing business platform in addition our size allows our company to
       negotiate volume discounts for certain purchases including waste
       disposal rates at landfills operated by third parties furthermore we
       have taken steps to increase utilization of our

                                        4
page

       assets for example to reduce the number of collection vehicles and
       maximize the efficiency of our fleet we have instituted a grid
       productivity program which allows us to benchmark the performance of all
       of our drivers in our larger markets we also routinely use a route
       optimization program to minimize drive time and improve operating
       density by using assets more efficiently operating expenses can be
       significantly reduced

      high levels of customer satisfaction  our goal of maintaining high
       levels of customer satisfaction complements our operating strategy our
       personalized sales process is oriented towards maintaining relationships
       and ensuring that service is being properly provided

      utilize systems to improve consistency in financial and operational
       reporting  we continue to focus on systems and training initiatives that
       complement our operating strategy these initiatives include contact
       management billing productivity maintenance and general ledger
       systems these systems provide us with detailed information prepared in
       a consistent manner that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon
       trends in our business

growth strategy

     our strategy focuses on increasing revenue gaining market share and
enhancing stockholder value through internal growth and acquisitions for
certain risks related to our growth strategy see risk factors

      internal growth  our internal growth strategy focuses on retaining
       existing customers and obtaining commercial municipal and industrial
       customers through our wellmanaged sales and marketing activities

         longterm contracts  we seek to obtain longterm contracts for
      collecting solid waste in highgrowth markets these include exclusive
      franchise agreements with municipalities as well as commercial and
      industrial contracts by obtaining such longterm agreements we have the
      opportunity to grow our contracted revenue base at the same rate as the
      underlying population growth in these markets for example we have
      secured exclusive longterm franchise agreements in highgrowth markets
      such as los angeles orange and contra costa counties in california las
      vegas nevada arlington texas and many areas of florida we believe that
      this positions our company to experience internal growth rates that are
      generally higher than our industrys overall growth rate in addition we
      believe that by securing a base of longterm recurring revenue in growth
      markets we are better able to protect our market position from
      competition and our business may be less susceptible to downturns in
      economic conditions

         sales and marketing activities  we seek to manage our sales and
      marketing activities to enable our company to capitalize on our leading
      positions in many of the markets in which we operate we currently have
      approximately 500 sales and marketing employees in the field who are
      compensated using a commission structure that is focused on generating
      high levels of quality revenue for the most part these employees
      directly solicit business from existing and prospective commercial
      industrial municipal and residential customers we emphasize our rate and
      cost structures when we train new and existing sales personnel in
      addition we utilize a contact management system that assists our sales
      people in tracking leads it also tracks renewal periods for existing and
      potential commercial industrial and franchise contracts

      acquisition growth  during the past several years the solid waste
       industry experienced a period of rapid consolidation we were able to
       grow significantly through acquisitions during this period however the
       rate of consolidation in the industry has slowed considerably despite
       this we continue to look to acquire businesses that complement our
       existing business platform our acquisition growth strategy focuses on
       the approximately 23 billion of revenue generated by privatelyheld
       solid waste companies and municipal and local governmental authorities in
       1999 we believe that our ability to acquire privatelyheld companies is
       enhanced by increasing competition in the solid waste industry
       increasing capital requirements as a result of changes in solid waste
       regulatory requirements and the limited number of exit strategies for
       these privatelyheld companies owners and principals we also

                                        5
page

       seek to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities that are
       privatizing which occurs for many of the same reasons that
       privatelyheld companies sell their solid waste businesses in addition
       we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire operations and
       facilities that may be divested by other publiclyowned waste companies
       in sum our acquisition growth strategy focuses on

         acquiring businesses that position our company for growth in existing
          and new markets

         acquiring wellmanaged companies and when appropriate retaining
          local management

         acquiring operations and facilities from municipalities that are
          privatizing and publiclyowned companies that are divesting of assets

         for certain risks involved with our acquisition growth strategy see
      risk factors  we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth
      strategy  we may be unable to manage our growth effectively and
       businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities

         acquire businesses positioning the company for growth  in making
      acquisitions we principally target high quality businesses that will
      allow our company to be or provide our company favorable prospects of
      becoming a leading provider of integrated solid waste services in markets
      with favorable demographic growth for example during 2001 we acquired
      richmond sanitary services located in northern california richmond
      complemented our business platform by providing us with a vertically
      integrated business in a growth market generally we have acquired and
      will continue to seek solid waste collection transfer and disposal
      companies that

         have strong operating margins

         are in growth markets

         are among the largest or have a significant presence in their local
          markets and

         have longterm contracts or franchises with municipalities and other
          customers

      once we have a base of operations in a particular market we focus on
      acquiring trucks and routes of smaller businesses that also operate in
      that market and surrounding markets which are typically referred to as
      tuckin acquisitions we seek to consolidate the operations of such
      tuckin businesses into our existing operations in that market we also
      seek to acquire landfills transfer stations and collection companies that
      operate in markets that we are already servicing in order to fully
      integrate our operations from collection to disposal in addition we have
      in the past and may continue in the future to exchange businesses with
      other solid waste companies if by doing so there is a net benefit to our
      business platform these activities allow us to increase our revenue and
      market share lower our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue and
      consolidate duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost
      efficiencies and economies of scale

         acquire wellmanaged companies  we also seek to acquire businesses
      that have experienced management teams that are willing to join the
      management of our company we generally seek to maintain continuity in
      management of larger acquired companies in order to capitalize on their
      local market knowledge community relations and name recognition and to
      instill their entrepreneurial drive at all levels of our operations by
      furnishing the local management of such acquired companies with our
      financial and marketing resources and technical expertise we believe that
      the acquired companies are better able to secure additional municipal
      franchises and other contracts

         privatize municipal operations and acquire divested operations  we
      also seek to acquire solid waste collection operations transfer stations
      and landfills that municipalities and other governmental authorities are
      privatizing many municipalities are seeking to outsource or sell these
      types of solid waste operations as they lack the capital technical
      expertise andor operational resources necessary to comply with
      increasingly stringent regulatory standards andor to compete effectively
      with privatesector companies in addition we have acquired and will
      continue to seek to acquire operations and facilities that may be
      divested by other publiclyowned waste companies

                                        6

operations

     our operations primarily consist of the collection and disposal of
nonhazardous solid waste

     collection services  we provide solid waste collection services to
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers in 22 states through
146 collection companies in 2001 76 of our revenue was derived from
collection services consisting of approximately 28 from services provided to
municipal and residential customers 40 from services provided to commercial
customers and 32 from services provided to industrial customers

     our residential collection operations involve the curbside collection of
refuse from small containers into collection vehicles for transport to transfer
stations or directly to landfills residential solid waste collection services
are typically performed under contracts with municipalities which we generally
secure by competitive bid and which give our company exclusive rights to service
all or a portion of the homes in their respective jurisdictions these contracts
or franchises usually range in duration from one to five years although some of
our exclusive franchises are for as long as 33 years residential solid waste
collection services may also be performed on a subscription basis in which
individual households contract directly with our company the fees received for
subscription residential collection are based primarily on market factors
frequency and type of service the distance to the disposal facility and cost of
disposal in general subscription residential collection fees are paid
quarterly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service

     in our commercial and industrial collection operations we supply our
customers with waste containers we also rent compactors to large waste
generators commercial collection services are generally performed under one to
threeyear service agreements and fees are determined by such considerations
as

      market factors

      collection frequency

      type of equipment furnished

      type and volume or weight of the waste collected

      distance to the disposal facility and

      cost of disposal

     we rent waste containers to construction sites and also provide waste
collection services to industrial and construction facilities on a contractual
basis with terms generally ranging from a single pickup to one year or longer
we collect the containers or compacted waste and transport the waste either to a
landfill or a transfer station for disposal

     we own or operate 89 transfer stations we deposit waste at these stations
as do other private haulers and municipal haulers for compaction and transfer
to trailers for transport to disposal sites or recycling facilities

     also we currently provide recycling services in certain markets primarily
to comply with local laws or obligations under our franchise agreements these
services include the curbside collection of residential recyclable waste and the
provision of a variety of recycling services to commercial and industrial
customers

     disposal services  as of december 31 2001 we owned or operated 54
landfills which had approximately 7450 permitted acres and total available
permitted disposal capacity of approximately 17 billion inplace cubic yards
the inplace capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering
factors requirements of regulatory authorities and the ability to expand our
sites successfully some of our landfills accept nonhazardous special waste
including utility ash asbestos and contaminated soils see  properties

     most of our existing landfill sites have the potential for expanded
disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage we monitor the
availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and
evaluate whether to pursue expansion at a given landfill based on estimated
future waste volumes and prices market needs remaining capacity and likelihood
of obtaining an expansion to satisfy future disposal demand

                                        7
page

we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain of our
landfills although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be
permitted as designed

     other services  we have 26 materials recovery facilities and other
recycling operations which are generally required to fulfill our obligations
under longterm municipal contracts for residential collection services these
facilities primarily sort recyclable paper aluminum glass and other materials
most of these recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential
collection operations in some areas we receive commercial and industrial solid
waste that is sorted at our facilities into recyclable materials and non
recyclable waste the recyclable materials are salvaged repackaged and sold to
third parties and the nonrecyclable waste is disposed of at landfills or
incinerators wherever possible our strategy is to reduce our exposure to
fluctuations in recyclable commodity prices by utilizing third party facilities
thereby minimizing our recycling investment

     we provide remediation and other heavy construction services primarily
through our subsidiary located in missouri during early 1998 this subsidiary
was awarded a contract by the army corps of engineers to dredge a portion of the
blue river revenue from this contract which was completed in december 1999
was approximately 52 million in march 2001 we agreed to act as a
subcontractor on the next phase of the blue river project revenue from this
contract which is scheduled to be completed in december 2002 is expected to be
approximately 17 million of which approximately 13 million has already been
recorded

     we also have a compost mulch and soil business at which yard mill and
other waste is processed packaged and sold as various products

sales and marketing

     we seek to provide quality services that will enable our company to
maintain high levels of customer satisfaction we derive our business from a
broad customer base which we believe will enable our company to experience
stable growth we focus our marketing efforts on continuing and expanding
business with existing customers as well as attracting new customers

     we employ approximately 500 sales and marketing employees our sales and
marketing strategy is to provide highquality comprehensive solid waste
collection recycling transfer and disposal services to our customers at
competitive prices we target potential customers of all sizes from small
quantity generators to large fortune 500 companies and municipalities

     most of our marketing activity is local in nature however in 2000 we
initiated a national accounts program in response to our customers needs we
will continue to develop this program in 2002 we generally do not change the
tradenames of the local businesses we acquire and therefore we do not operate
nationally under any one mark or tradename rather we rely on the goodwill
associated with the acquired companies local tradenames as used in each
geographic market in which we operate

customers

     we provide services to commercial industrial municipal and residential
customers no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our
consolidated revenue in any of the last three years our largest customer in
2001 comprised less than 1 of our consolidated revenue and our largest
municipal franchise comprised less than 4

competition

     we operate in a highly competitive industry  entry into our business and
the ability to operate profitably in the industry requires substantial amounts
of capital and managerial experience

     competition in the nonhazardous solid waste industry comes from a few
large national publiclyowned companies including waste management and allied
waste industries several regional publicly and privatelyowned solid waste
companies and thousands of small privatelyowned companies some of our
competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly
greater financial resources than

                                        8
page

we do in addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies
we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal
operations these municipalities may have financial advantages due to the
availability of tax revenues and taxexempt financing

     we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the
quality of our services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price
of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively
bid municipal contract this may have an impact on our future revenue and
profitability

     in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for
landfill business on the basis of disposal costs geographical location and
quality of operations our ability to obtain landfill business may be limited by
the fact that some major collection companies also own or operate landfills to
which they send their waste there also has been an increasing trend at the
state and local levels to mandate waste reduction at the source and to prohibit
the disposal of certain types of wastes such as yard wastes at landfills this
may result in the volume of waste going to landfills being reduced in certain
areas which may affect our ability to operate our landfills at their full
capacity andor affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal
services in addition most of the states in which we operate landfills have
adopted plans or requirements that set goals for specified percentages of
certain solid waste items to be recycled

regulation

     our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal state
and local requirements which regulate public health safety the environment
zoning and land use operating and other permits are generally required for
landfills and transfer stations certain waste collection vehicles fuel storage
tanks and other facilities that we own or operate and these permits are subject
to revocation modification and renewal in certain circumstances federal state
and local regulations vary but generally govern wastewater or stormwater
discharges air emissions the treatment storage transportation and disposal
of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination
associated with the release of hazardous substances these regulations provide
governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement which include the
ability to obtain injunctions andor impose fines or penalties in the case of
violations including criminal penalties the us environmental protection
agency and various other federal state and local environmental public and
occupational health and safety agencies and authorities including the
occupational safety and health administration of the us department of labor
administer these regulations

     we strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations however in the existing climate of heightened environmental
concerns from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from
governmental authorities which have resulted in the need to expend funds for
remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities
there is no assurance that citations and notices will not be issued in the
future despite our regulatory compliance efforts we have established a reserve
which we believe based on currently available information will be adequate to
cover any potential regulatory costs however we cannot assure you that actual
costs will not exceed our reserve

     federal regulation  the following summarizes the primary environmental
public and occupational safetyrelated federal statutes of the united states
affecting our facilities and operations

          1 the solid waste disposal act as amended by the resource
     conservation and recovery act rcra and its implementing regulations
     establish a framework for regulating the handling transportation
     treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous solid
     wastes and require states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal
     of solid wastes in sanitary landfills

          subtitle d of the rcra establishes a framework for regulating the
     disposal of municipal solid wastes regulations under subtitle d currently
     include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and
     guidelines including location restrictions facility design and operating
     criteria closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance
     standards groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action
     standards many of which had not commonly been in effect or enforced in the
     past in connection with municipal solid waste landfills each state was
     required to submit a permit program designed to implement subtitle d
     regulations to the epa by april 9 1993 all of the states in which we

                                        9
page

     operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to the rcra and subtitle
     d these state permit programs may include landfill requirements which are
     more stringent than those of subtitle d

          all of our planned landfill expansions or new landfill development
     projects have been engineered to meet or exceed subtitle d requirements
     operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to
     comply with these new regulations compliance with the subtitle d
     regulations has resulted in increased costs and may in the future require
     substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally
     associated with our waste management activities

          2 the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
     liability act of 1980 cercla among other things provides for the cleanup
     of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous
     substance into the environment cercla may impose strict or joint and
     several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural
     resources upon current owners and operators of the site parties who were
     owners or operators of the site at the time the hazardous substances were
     disposed of parties who transported the hazardous substance to the site
     and parties who arranged for disposal at the site under the authority of
     this act and its implementing regulations detailed requirements apply to
     the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and
     sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released
     into the environment liability under this act is not dependent upon the
     existence or disposal of hazardous wastes but can also be based upon the
     existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances characterized
     by the epa as hazardous many of which may be found in common household
     waste

          among other things this act authorizes the federal government to
     investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or
     are threatened to be released into the environment or to order or offer
     an opportunity to persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the
     hazardous substances to do so in addition the epa has established a
     national priorities list of sites at which hazardous substances have been
     or are threatened to be released and which require investigation or
     cleanup

          liability under cercla is not dependent upon the intentional disposal
     of hazardous wastes it can be founded upon the release or threatened
     release even as a result of unintentional nonnegligent or lawful action
     of thousands of hazardous substances including very small quantities of
     such substances thus even if our landfills have never knowingly received
     hazardous wastes as such it is possible that one or more hazardous
     substances may have been deposited or released at our landfills or at
     other properties which we may have owned or operated therefore we could
     be liable under cercla for the cost of cleaning up such hazardous
     substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources even if
     those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or
     operated them the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive given
     the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment
     liability such liability could have a material impact on our business and
     financial condition for a further discussion see  liability insurance
     and bonding

          3 the federal water pollution control act of 1972  this act
     regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources including
     solid waste disposal sites into streams rivers and other waters point
     source runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged
     into surface waters must be covered by discharge permits that generally
     require us to conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain
     circumstances reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges storm
     water discharge regulations under this act require a permit for certain
     construction activities and discharges from industrial operations and
     facilities which may affect our operations if a landfill or transfer
     station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publiclyowned
     treatment works the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by
     that treatment works in addition states may adopt groundwater protection
     programs under this act or the safe drinking water act that could affect
     solid waste landfills furthermore development which alters or affects
     wetlands must generally be permitted prior to such development
     commencing and certain mitigation requirements may be required by the
     permitting agencies

          4 the clean air act  the clean air act imposes limitations on
     emissions from various sources including landfills in march 1996 the epa
     enacted rules that require large municipal solid waste
                                        10
page

     landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems these regulations
     apply to landfills that have been operating since november 1987 and that
     can accommodate 25 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste
     the regulations apply whether the landfill is active or closed the date by
     which each affected landfill must have the required gas collection and
     control system is dependent upon the adoption of state regulations and the
     date that the epa approves the state program many state regulatory
     agencies currently require monitoring systems for the collection and
     control of landfill gas we do not expect that compliance with any new
     state regulations will have a material effect on us

          5 the occupational safety and health act of 1970  this act
     authorizes the occupational safety and health administration to promulgate
     occupational safety and health standards a number of these standards
     including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of
     asbestos apply to our facilities and operations

     state regulation  each state in which we operate has its own laws and
regulations governing solid waste disposal water and air pollution and in most
cases releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such
matters states also have adopted regulations governing the design operation
maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations our facilities and
operations are likely to be subject to these types of requirements in addition
our solid waste collection and landfill operations may be affected by the trend
in many states toward requiring the development of waste reduction and recycling
programs for example several states have enacted laws that require counties or
municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce through waste planning
composting recycling or other programs the volume of solid waste deposited in
landfills additionally laws and regulations restricting the disposal of
certain wastes including yard waste newspapers beverage containers
unshredded tires leadacid batteries and household appliances in solid waste
landfills have been promulgated in several states and are being considered in
others legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste
reduction at the source and waste recycling also are under consideration by
congress and the epa respectively

     in order to construct expand and operate a landfill one or more
construction or operating permits as well as zoning approvals must be
obtained these are difficult and timeconsuming to obtain are often opposed by
neighboring landowners and citizens groups may be subject to periodic renewal
and are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agency in
connection with our acquisition of existing landfills it may be and on occasion
has been necessary for our company to expend considerable time effort and money
to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements
and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity

     many of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks which are
generally used to store petroleumbased products these tanks are generally
subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that mandate their
periodic testing upgrading closure and removal and that in the event of
leaks require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated we believe
that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet all applicable
regulations if underground storage tanks we own or operate leak and the
leakage migrates onto the property of others we could be liable for response
costs and other damages to third parties we are unaware of facts indicating
that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks
will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

     finally with regard to our solid waste transportation operations we are
subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board and are
regulated by the federal highway administration office of motor carriers and by
regulatory agencies in each state various states have enacted or are
considering enacting laws and regulations that would restrict the interstate
transportation and processing of solid waste in 1978 the united states supreme
court held similar laws and regulations unconstitutional however states have
attempted to distinguish proposed laws and regulations from the laws and
regulations involved in that ruling in 1994 the supreme court ruled that state
and local flow control laws and ordinances which attempt to restrict waste from
leaving its place of generation were an impermissible burden on interstate
commerce and therefore were unconstitutional however states have also
attempted to distinguish proposed laws and regulations from the laws and
regulations involved in that ruling in response to these supreme court rulings
congress has considered passing legislation authorizing states and local
governments to restrict the free

                                        11
page

movement of solid waste in interstate commerce if federal legislation
authorizing state and local governments to restrict the free movement of solid
waste in interstate commerce is enacted such legislation could adversely affect
our operations

     we have established a reserve for landfill and environmental costs which
includes landfill site closure and postclosure costs we periodically reassess
such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace
and the technical requirements of subtitle d of the rcra and adjust our rates
used to expense closure and postclosure costs accordingly based on current
information and regulatory requirements we believe that our reserves for such
environmental and landfill expenditures are adequate however environmental
laws may change and there can be no assurance that our reserves will be
adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental regulations
future changes or interpretations of existing regulations or the identification
of adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us see managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations  landfill and environmental matters and risk
factors  compliance with environmental regulation may impede our growth

liability insurance and bonding

     the nature of our business exposes our company to the risk of liabilities
arising out of our operations including possible damages to the environment
such potential liabilities could involve for example claims for remediation
costs personal injury property damage and damage to the environment in cases
where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials claims of
employees customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage
occurring in the course of our operations or claims alleging negligence in the
planning or performance of work we could also be subject to fines and civil and
criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory
requirements because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental
damages liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant our
solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with
limits in excess of those required by permit regulations subject to certain
limitations and exclusions however we cannot assure you that the limits of
such environmental liability insurance would be adequate in the event of a major
loss nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental
liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such
coverage costs prohibitive

     we have general liability vehicle liability employment practices
liability pollution liability directors and officers liability workers
compensation and employers liability coverage as well as umbrella liability
policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in
these primary policies we also carry property insurance although we try to
operate safely and prudently and while we have subject to limitations and
exclusions substantial liability insurance no assurance can be given that we
will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

     our insurance programs for workers compensation general liability
vehicle liability and employeerelated health care benefits are effectively
selfinsured claims in excess of selfinsurance levels are fully insured
accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not
reported

     in the normal course of business we may be required to post performance
bonds insurance policies letters of credit andor cash deposits in connection
with municipal residential collection contracts the operation closure or
postclosure of landfills certain remediation contracts certain environmental
permits and certain business licenses and permits bonds issued by surety
companies operate as a financial guarantee of our performance to date we have
satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash deposits or by
obtaining bank letters of credit insurance policies or surety bonds

employees

     as of december 31 2001 we employed approximately 12700 fulltime
employees approximately 3200 of whom were covered by collective bargaining
agreements our management believes that we have good relations with our
employees

                                        12

compensation

     we believe that our compensation program effectively aligns our field and
corporate management team with the companys overall goal of generating
increasing amounts of free cash flow while achieving targeted earnings and
returns on invested capital this is done by utilizing simple and measurable
metrics on which incentive pay is based at the field level these metrics are
based upon free cash flow earnings and return on invested capital for each
managers geographic area of responsibility great effort is taken to ensure
that these individual goals agree to the overall goals of the company incentive
compensation at the corporate level is based on the obtainment of our companys
overall goals in addition certain field and corporate employees also
participate in a longterm incentive program we believe this program aligns our
companys short and longterm goals and helps ensure that the longterm success
of our company is not sacrificed for the obtainment of shortterm goals

corporate history

     we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in 1996 by our former parent
company autonation in 1995 h wayne huizenga harris w hudson and their
associates made an investment in autonation then known as republic waste
industries inc and autonation subsequently acquired businesses in several
industries including automotive dealerships and car rental businesses in
addition to over 100 nonhazardous solid waste companies in 1998 autonation
separated its nonhazardous solid waste services division from its other
businesses by forming our company and we completed an initial public offering of
shares of our common stock in 1999 autonation sold substantially all of its
remaining interest in our company in a secondary public offering

within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as
amended including in particular certain statements about our plans
strategies and prospects although we believe that our plans intentions and
expectations reflected in or suggested by such forwardlooking statements are
reasonable we cannot assure you that such plans intentions or expectations
will be achieved important factors that could cause our actual results to
differ materially from our forwardlooking statements include those set forth in
this risk factors section all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or
any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements set forth below unless the context requires
otherwise all references to the company we us or our include republic
services inc and its subsidiaries

     if any of the following risks or other risks not presently known to us or
that we currently believe to not be significant develop into actual events
then our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or
prospects could be materially adversely affected

we operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to compete
effectively

     we operate in a highly competitive business environment some of our
competitors have significantly larger operations and may have significantly
greater financial resources than we do in addition the solid waste industry is
constantly changing as a result of rapid consolidation which may create
additional competitive pressures in our business environment

     we also compete with municipalities that maintain their own waste
collection or disposal operations these municipalities may have a financial
advantage over us as a result of the availability of tax revenue and taxexempt
financing

     we compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the
quality of services from time to time our competitors may reduce the price of
their services in an effort to expand their market share or to win a
competitively bid municipal contract

     in each market in which we own or operate a landfill we compete for solid
waste volume on the basis of disposal or tipping fees geographical location
and quality of operations our ability to obtain solid waste
                                        13
page

volume for our landfills may be limited by the fact that some major collection
companies also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste in
markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill our collection operations
may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors

     as a result of these factors we may have difficulty competing effectively
from time to time

economic conditions may continue to adversely affect our business operations
and internal growth

     during 2001 commodity prices were lower primarily due to the economic
slowdown this reduction in commodity prices negatively impacted our operating
margins the economic slowdown also negatively impacted the portion of our
business servicing the manufacturing sector and the nonresidential construction
industry landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction
activity began to weaken furthermore the portion of our business that services
the residential construction industry was negatively impacted toward the latter
part of 2001 a continued slowdown in the economy could further adversely affect
volumes pricing and operating margins in our collection transfer and disposal
operations

     the waste business is labor intensive during 2000 the nation experienced
record lows in unemployment this tight labor market resulted in higher labor
costs for our company as we competed for a dwindling number of available
workers while we do not anticipate a significant reduction in available
workers our labor costs could increase in the future as we attempt to attract
and retain experienced employees in tight labor markets

we may be unable to execute our financial strategy

     our ability to execute our financial strategy is dependent upon our ability
to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt the credit rating
process is contingent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond our
control

     our financial strategy is also dependent upon our ability to generate
sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business to fund our internal
growth to acquire other solid waste businesses repurchase shares of our common
stock andor minimize our borrowings we cannot assure you that we will generate
sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy or that we will be able
to repurchase our common stock at prices that are accretive to earnings per
share

we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy

     our ability to execute our growth strategy still depends in part on our
ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates as well as our
ability to successfully consolidate acquired operations into our business the
consolidation of our operations with the operations of acquired companies
including the consolidation of systems procedures personnel and facilities
the relocation of staff and the achievement of anticipated cost savings
economies of scale and other business efficiencies presents significant
challenges to our management particularly if several acquisitions occur at the
same time in short we cannot assure you that

      desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified

      we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified

      we will effectively consolidate companies which are acquired and fully or
       timely realize the expected cost savings economies of scale or business
       efficiencies or

      any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings

     additional factors may negatively impact our acquisition growth strategy
our acquisition strategy requires spending significant amounts of capital if we
are unable to obtain additional needed financing on acceptable terms we may
need to reduce the scope of our acquisition growth strategy which could have a
material adverse effect on our growth prospects the intense competition among
our competitors pursuing the same acquisition candidates may increase purchase
prices for solid waste businesses and increase our capital requirements andor
prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates if any of the
aforementioned

                                        14
page

factors force us to alter our growth strategy our financial condition results
of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected

we may be unable to manage our growth effectively

     our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial
operational and management resources in order to continue our growth we will
need to add administrative and other personnel and make additional investments
in operations and systems we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and
train qualified personnel or do so on a timely basis or expand our operations
and systems to the extent and in the time required

businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities

     in pursuing our acquisition strategy our investigations of the acquisition
candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the
acquisition candidates if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities
as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities we
typically try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by obtaining
indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies by deferring payment
of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by
acquiring only specified assets however we cannot assure you that we will be
able to obtain indemnifications or that they will be enforceable collectible or
sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed
liabilities arising from our acquisitions

we depend on key personnel

     our future success depends on the continued contributions of several key
employees and officers we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on
any of our officers the loss of the services of key employees and officers
whether such loss is through resignation or other causes or the inability to
attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects

compliance with environmental regulation may impede our growth

     we may need to spend considerable time effort and capital to keep our
facilities in compliance with federal state and local requirements regulating
health safety environment zoning and land use in addition some of our waste
operations that cross state boundaries could be adversely affected if the
federal government or the state or locality in which these waste operations are
located imposes discriminatory fees on or otherwise limits or prohibits the
transportation or disposal of solid waste if environmental laws become more
stringent our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental
compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of
unanticipated events or regulatory developments the amounts and timing of
future environmental expenditures could vary substantially from those we
currently anticipate because of the nature of our operations we have in the
past currently are and may in the future be named as a potentially responsible
party in connection with the investigation or remediation of environmental
conditions we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such investigations
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of
operations or cash flows a significant judgment or fine against our company or
our loss of significant permits or licenses could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or
prospects

regulatory approval to develop or expand our landfills and transfer stations may
be delayed or denied

     our plans include developing new landfills and transfer stations as well
as expanding the disposal and transfer capacities of certain of our landfills
and transfer stations respectively various parties including citizens groups
and local politicians sometimes challenge these projects responding to these
challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated
with establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities in addition
failure to receive regulatory approval may prohibit us from establishing new
facilities and expanding existing facilities

our financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may
differ from actual results

     our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include
amounts based on estimates and assumptions made by us actual results could
differ from these amounts significant items subject to such estimates and
assumptions include the carrying value of longlived assets the depletion and
amortization of landfill development costs accruals for closure and
postclosure costs valuation allowances for accounts receivable liabilities
for potential litigation claims and assessments and liabilities for
environmental remediation deferred taxes and selfinsurance

     we currently accrue for landfill closure and postclosure costs based on
consumption of landfill airspace as of december 31 2001 assuming that all
available landfill capacity is used we expect to expense approximately 4904
million of landfill closure and postclosure costs over the remaining lives of
these facilities we cannot assure you that our reserves for landfill and
environmental costs will be adequate to cover the requirements of existing
environmental regulations future changes or interpretations of existing
regulations or the identification of adverse environmental conditions
previously unknown to us

an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business

     our operations are dependent upon fuel which we purchase in the open
market on a daily basis during 2000 we experienced a significant increase in
the cost of fuel a portion of this increase was passed on to our customers
however because of the competitive nature of the waste industry there can be
no assurances that we will be able to pass on future fuel price increases to our
customers accordingly a significant increase in fuel costs could adversely
affect our business

seasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations

     our operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather
which could delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of
waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites
and other facilities

we may be unable to extend the maturity of our revolving shortterm credit
facility

     we have a revolving shortterm credit facility in the principal amount of
3000 million which expires in july 2002 we anticipate extending the maturity
of this credit facility until july 2003 however we cannot assure you that we
will receive such extension and if so whether such extension will be on terms
as favorable to us as those currently contained in the credit facility

the outcome of an audit by the internal revenue service may adversely affect our
company

     through the date of our initial public offering in july 1998 we filed
consolidated federal income tax returns with autonation the internal revenue
service is auditing autonations consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 1995
through 1999 in accordance with the tax sharing agreement we have with
autonation we may be liable for certain assessments imposed by the internal
revenue service for the periods through june 1998 resulting from this audit no
assurance can be given with respect to the outcome of this audit or the effect
it may have on us or that our reserves with respect thereto are adequate a
significant assessment against us could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position results of operations or cash flows

proceedings in the ordinary course of business we can give you no assurance
regarding the outcome of these proceedings or the effect their outcomes may
have or that our insurance coverages or reserves are adequate a significant
judgment against our company the loss of significant permits or licenses or
the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position results of operations or prospects

against our company and certain of our officers and directors in the united
states district court for the southern district of florida the plaintiffs in
these lawsuits claimed on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our
companys common stock between january 28 1999 and august 28 1999 that the
defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of
1934 by among other things allegedly making materially false and misleading
statements regarding our companys growth and the assets acquired from waste
management the court subsequently consolidated these lawsuits into an action
entitled in re republic services inc securities litigation the plaintiffs
filed a consolidated complaint in february 2000 which was subsequently dismissed
by the court without prejudice in february 2001 a motion to the court by the
plaintiffs to reconsider this decision was thereafter denied and the court

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

     you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual
report on form 10k

2001 financial objectives

     in january 2001 we publicly announced our objectives for the year these
objectives included the following

      increasing free cash flow by 18 to 145 million or over 60 of net
       income

      growing revenue by 5 with 2 from price and 3 from volume

      increasing earnings per share by 6 to 136 this objective assumed a
       vshaped recovery in the economy during the second half of the year

      using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic
       acquisitions and repurchasing up to 1000 million of our stock

      maintaining our strong balance sheet evidenced by a debt to total
       capitalization ratio in the mid to low 40 range

2001 business performance

     revenue and operating margins were pressured by falling commodity prices
during the first quarter our internal growth for the quarter excluding the
impact of commodity prices was 43 with 22 coming from price and 21 from
volume higher fuel costs also pressured margins during the quarter in
addition we strengthened our regional management structure by adding sales
maintenance and operational personnel during this period this increase in staff
resulted in increased selling general and administrative costs placing further
downward pressure on operating margins

     during the second quarter of 2001 revenue and operating margins were
negatively impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices in addition we
began to see a slowdown in the manufacturing sector particularly in the
midwestern and midatlantic states our internal growth for the quarter
excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of
noncore operations was 50 with 20 coming from price and 30 coming from
volume higher labor costs also pressured margins during the quarter

     during the second quarter we acquired richmond sanitary services located
in northern california richmond complemented our business platform by providing
us with a vertically integrated business in a growth market

     during the third quarter of 2001 the economic slowdown began to impact our
industrial business servicing the nonresidential construction industry
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began
to weaken in addition the slowdown we began to experience in the second
quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see
significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united
states particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the
carolinas these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers our
internal growth for the quarter excluding the negative impact of commodity
prices and the positive impact of noncore operations was 21 with 16 coming
from price and 5 coming from volume this rate of internal growth was
approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters of 2001 while we
continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers these customers
generally produce less revenue and lower margins than other types of customers

     also during the third quarter operating margins continued to be pressured
by lower commodity prices and higher labor costs selling general and
administrative costs were also higher due to the previously

                                        21

discussed strengthening of our regional management structure and due to an
increase in bad debt expense attributable to the economic slowdown

     during the third quarter we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes with a
coupon rate of 6 34 that mature in 2011 this transaction allowed us to secure
longterm financing at what we believe is a very favorable rate

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we continued to see a weakening in waste
volumes from the manufacturing sector we also continued to see a slowdown in
commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume
reductions and price sensitivity for these services furthermore we began to
see a softening in residential construction activity as a result internal
growth for the quarter excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and
the positive impact of noncore operations was 26 with 18 coming from price
and 8 coming from volume internal growth for all of 2001 excluding the
negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of noncore
operations was 34 with 19 coming from price and 15 coming from volume

     operating margins also weakened during the fourth quarter for the reasons
mentioned above we continued to see medical costs escalate and we began to
experience higher costs for risk insurance we also continued to experience
higher labor costs and selling general and administrative costs due to the
strengthening of our regional management structure in addition bad debt
expense continued to increase as a result of the economic slowdown

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on
an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis included in this
charge are the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core
and noncore businesses asset impairments downsizing our compost mulch and
soil business and related inventory adjustments an increase in insurance
reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown
on a reported basis including the impact of the charge our earnings per share
for 2001 were 73

     on an adjusted basis before considering the impact of the charge we
recorded during the fourth quarter our earnings per share were 124 while we
did not achieve our announced earnings per share objective for 2001 for reasons
primarily attributable to the economic slowdown our free cash flow was 1470
million or 69 of adjusted net income our disciplined approach to managing
capital expenditures and our focus on monetizing accounts receivable helped us
to exceed our free cash flow objective our debt to total capitalization as of
december 31 2001 was 413

     during 2001 we used our free cash flow to repurchase 56 million shares of
our common stock for 992 million in addition we acquired richmond sanitary
services a fully integrated waste disposal company located in northern
california

2002 financial objectives

     our financial objectives for 2002 assume no deterioration or improvement in
the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2001
specific guidance is as follows

      our goal is to generate 1470 million in free cash flow this includes
       the net impact of the change in accounting for goodwill the comparable
       amount in 2001 assuming the change in accounting for goodwill was
       effective january 1 2001 would have been 1320 million

      we anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common
       stock under our 1250 million share repurchase program approved by our
       board of directors in october 2001

      we anticipate earnings per share of 137 to 139 this includes the
       expected decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the change in
       accounting for goodwill

      we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 15 to 20
       approximately 10 attributable to price and 5 to 10 attributable to
       volume

business initiatives

     our business initiatives for 2002 are generally a continuation of those
initiated in 2001 and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and
improving our systems ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and
processes and are trained in our new systems is essential to the overall success
of our initiatives our business initiatives for 2002 are as follows

      improve our revenue  the first step in this process was completed in
       2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system
       this system enables us to among other things stratify our customers to
       determine how our rates compare to current market pricing during 2002
       we expect to implement the second generation of this software which we
       call rsi 10 rsi 10 will be our companys core business system
       providing a variety of functionalities including customer service
       dispatch billing sales analysis and route productivity analysis

       we are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing
       model this model will eventually allow us to track our return on
       investment by customer

       during 2001 we also implemented a customer relationship management
       system this system will improve the productivity of our sales force by
       helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads it also
       tracks renewal periods for existing and potential commercial industrial
       and franchise contracts our focus during 2002 will be to ensure our
       sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended

      improve the productivity of our operations  we have instituted a grid
       productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our
       drivers in addition in our larger markets we routinely use a route
       optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational
       density during 2001 we completed a disposal optimization review this
       review determines which local disposal option maximizes our return on
       invested capital and cash flow

      improve fleet management and procurement  in february 2002 we selected
       dossier as our fleet management and procurement system among other
       features this system will track parts inventories generate automatic
       quantity order points and log all maintenance work it will allow us to
       capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance
       programs comply with manufacturers warranties in addition the purchase
       order module within this system will allow us to crossreference
       purchasing information with our inventory we expect to have dossier
       implemented at all of our hauling operations by the end of 2002 and we
       expect to roll this system out to our landfill operations in 2003

      enhance operational and financial reporting systems  we currently have
       several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and
       financial reporting systems the overall goal of these initiatives is to
       provide us with detailed information prepared in a consistent manner
       that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our
       business

       the most significant of these systems is our enterprisewide general
       ledger package by february 2002 we successfully converted 40 of our
       locations to lawson general ledger software we expect to have the entire
       company converted to lawson by the third quarter of 2002

       all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more
       consistent and detailed information thus allowing us to make quicker and
       more informed business decisions in addition during 2001 all of our
       software applications were standardized and centralized at our data
       center in fort lauderdale florida this standardization and
       centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our
       operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines it
       also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery
       plan if necessary

      expand our safety training programs  as part of our ongoing emphasis on
       safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance
       costs we are expanding our safety training programs in 2002 we have
       signed a multiyear agreement with dupont safety resources to assist us
       in successfully completing this initiative

     we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations
and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services
including recycling and compost mulch and soil operations

     the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years
ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 in millions

     certain amounts for 2000 and 1999 in the table above have been reclassified
to conform to the 2001 presentation

     our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from
commercial industrial municipal and residential customers our residential and
commercial collection operations in some markets are based on longterm
contracts with municipalities we generally provide industrial and commercial
collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to
three years our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping
fees charged to third parties in general we integrate our recycling operations
with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable
materials no one customer has individually accounted for more than 10 of our
consolidated revenue in any of the last three years during 2001 our largest
customer comprised less than 1 of our consolidated revenue and our largest
municipal franchise comprised less than 4

     the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes
disposal labor fuel and equipment maintenance costs we try to be more
efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of
collection through disposal during the three months ended december 31 2001
approximately 52 of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at
landfills we own or operate

     our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses costs of
capital for cell development accruals for closure and postclosure costs and
the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance we
expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred we use
life cycle accounting and the unitsofconsumption method to recognize certain
direct landfill costs in life cycle accounting certain direct costs are
capitalized or accrued and charged to expense based upon the consumption of
cubic yards of available airspace these costs include all costs to acquire
construct close and maintain a site during the postclosure period

     cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers
together with our engineers these estimates are used by our operating and
accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized
costs and accrue closure and postclosure costs changes in these estimates

                                        24

primarily relate to changes in available airspace inflation rates and
applicable regulations changes in available airspace include changes in design
and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas deemed
likely to be permitted

critical accounting policies and disclosures

     our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include
certain estimates and judgments made by management in 1999 we significantly
expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that require subjective
or complex judgments including landfill accounting fixed assets and the
activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and postclosure
accruals insurance reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts as part of our
continuing commitment to reliable and transparent financial reporting that
allows the users of our financial statements to make more informed decisions we
have prepared the following list of accounting policies that we believe are the
most critical in understanding our companys financial condition results of
operations and cash flows and may require management to make subjective or
complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain



                                                   subjective or            disclosure

business combinations

     we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and
strategic considerations we have included businesses that we acquired and which
have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in our
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition

     we acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended december
31 2001 which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the
aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was 2877 million the
aggregate purchase price paid less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt
assumed was 2475 million

     in july 1999 we entered into a definitive agreement with allied waste
industries to acquire certain solid waste assets in 2000 we had completed the
purchase of these assets for approximately 1055 million in cash 858 million
of which were acquired during 2000 in october 1999 we entered into a
definitive agreement with allied for the simultaneous purchase and sale of
certain other solid waste assets in 2000 we and allied had completed the
purchase and sale of these assets for which annual revenue was approximately
1450 million our net proceeds from the cash portion of the exchange of assets
were 307 million all of these transactions have been accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting

     in september 1998 we signed an agreement with waste management to acquire
assets and to enter into disposal agreements at various waste management
facilities by june 1999 we had completed the purchase of the assets for
approximately 4796 million in cash plus properties 2927 million of which
were acquired during the six months ended june 30 1999 the assets purchased
included 16 landfills 11 transfer stations and 136 commercial collection routes
across the united states and were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting

     in addition to the acquisitions from allied and waste management we also
acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended december
31 2000 and 1999 which were accounted for under the

                                        30
page

purchase method of accounting the aggregate purchase price we paid in these
transactions was 1025 million and 4308 million in cash respectively

     cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2001 acquisitions
totaled approximately 2233 million as of december 31 2001 we had intangible
assets net of accumulated amortization of 15516 million which consist
primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired we
amortize cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over forty
years on a straightline basis as of december 31 2001 the amortization
expense associated with these intangible assets on an annualized basis is
approximately 485 million we believe the fortyyear life assigned to the cost
in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is reasonable as the
businesses we acquired are generally wellestablished companies which have been
in existence for many years and have stable longterm customer relationships

     during 2001 626 million of the total purchase price paid for
acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill
airspace as of december 31 2001 we had 9588 million of landfill development
costs which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as
other capitalized landfill costs if multiple entities are included in an
acquisition purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted
expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within
the acquired group and is adjusted for other nondepletable landfill assets and
liabilities acquired primarily closure and postclosure liabilities landfill
purchase price is amortized using the unitsofconsumption method over total
available airspace which includes likely to be permitted airspace where
appropriate

     cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2000 acquisitions
totaled approximately 2534 million as of december 31 2000 we had intangible
assets net of accumulated amortization of 14350 million which consist
primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in
addition during 2000 309 million of the total purchase price paid for
acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace

     cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 1999 acquisitions
totaled approximately 4193 million as of december 31 1999 we had intangible
assets net of accumulated amortization of 12973 million which consist
primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in
addition during 1999 3288 million of the total purchase price paid for
acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace

background

     in may 1998 autonation announced its intention to separate our company
which at the time was a whollyowned subsidiary of autonation from autonation
and for our company to complete an initial public offering of common stock as a
result we entered into certain agreements with autonation providing for the
separation and governing various interim and ongoing relationships between our
company and autonation in addition our outstanding shares of common stock held
by autonation were recapitalized into 957 million shares

     in july 1998 we completed an initial public offering resulting in net
proceeds of approximately 14 billion in addition in july 1998 we repaid in
full amounts due to autonation as of june 30 1998 through the issuance of 165
million shares of our common stock and through the payment of all proceeds from
our initial public offering

     in may 1999 we completed a secondary offering in which autonation sold
substantially all of our common stock it owned we received no proceeds in the
secondary offering

     autonation provided our company with the services of a number of its
executives and employees in consideration for these services autonation
allocated to our company a portion of its general and administrative costs
related to these services in january 1999 we entered into a services agreement
with autonation under which autonation agreed to continue to provide various
general and administrative services to our company in exchange for a monthly fee
of 09 million the services agreement expired on june 30 1999 our management
believes that the amounts allocated to our company andor charged under

                                        31
page

the services agreement were no less favorable to our company than costs we would
have incurred to obtain such services on our own or from unaffiliated third
parties

     we recorded other charges of 69 million for the year ended december 31
1999 these costs relate to our separation from autonation they consist of 20
million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement
employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our
common stock at the date of grant see note 8 stock options of the notes to
our consolidated financial statements for further information they also consist
of 49 million of other additional charges directly related to our separation

annual report on form 10k does not necessarily reflect what our financial
position and results of operations would have been had we been operated as a
separate standalone entity during this period

     price growth for the year ended december 31 2001 was negatively impacted
by declining commodity prices excluding the negative effect of commodity
prices price growth was 19 for the year ended december 31 2001 in addition
noncore operations increased volume growth during the year ended december 31
2001 excluding the positive impact of noncore operations volume growth was
15 for the year ended december 31 2001 as such adjusted internal growth for
the year ended december 31 2001 was 34

     during the first and second quarters of 2001 our revenue was negatively
impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices in addition during the
second quarter of 2001 we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the
manufacturing sector particularly in the midwestern and midatlantic states

     during the third quarter of 2001 the economic slowdown began to impact our
industrial business servicing the nonresidential construction industry
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began
to weaken in addition the slowdown we began to experience in the second
quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see
significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united
states particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the
carolinas these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers which
were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we continued to see a weakening in waste
volumes from the manufacturing sector we also continued to see a slowdown in
commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume
reductions and price sensitivity for these services furthermore we began to
see a softening in residential construction activity

     our price and volume growth rates may decline in 2002 depending upon the
severity and duration of the economic slowdown

     cost of operations  cost of operations was 14225 million 12713
million and 11319 million or as a percentage of revenue 630 605 and
605 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the
increase in aggregate dollars from 1999 to 2000 is a result of the expansion of
our operations through acquisitions and internal growth cost of operations as a
percentage of revenue remained constant from 1999 to 2000 because improved
operating efficiencies and an increase in higher margin landfill operations
primarily due to acquisitions were offset by higher fuel and labor costs

     the increase in aggregate dollars from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result
of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth
during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on an
aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax amount
242 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the
downsizing of our compost mulch and soil business and related inventory
adjustments and an increase in insurance reserves

     excluding the impact of this charge cost of operations for 2001 was
13983 million or 619 as a percent of revenue the increase in cost of
operations as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result of
the economic slowdown lower commodity prices higher labor costs and higher
costs for risk and health insurance partially offset by improved operating
efficiencies and revenue mix in addition during 2001 we continued to be
successful in attracting municipal customers however these customers generally
produce less revenue and lower margins than other customers we believe that
cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high or
increase further depending upon the severity and duration of the economic
slowdown

     depreciation amortization and depletion of property and equipment
depreciation amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment
were 1683 million 1570 million and 1303 million or as a percentage of
revenue 74 75 and 70 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars for all periods presented
and the increase as a percentage of revenue from 1999 to 2000 are primarily due
to acquisitions and capital expenditures the decrease as a percentage of
revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to lower depletion expense at our
landfills resulting from higher compaction and more cost efficient cell
construction

     amortization of intangible assets  expenses for amortization of intangible
assets were 471 million 404 million and 329 million or as a percentage
of revenue 21 19 and 17 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and
1999 respectively the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of
revenue is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of
acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

     intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net
assets acquired but also includes values assigned to longterm contracts and
covenants not to compete commencing january 1 2002 cost in excess of fair
value of net assets acquired is no longer required to be amortized

     selling general and administrative expenses  selling general and
administrative expenses were 2365 million 1939 million and 1767 million
or as a percentage of revenue 105 92 and 95 for the years ended
december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the increases in aggregate
dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through
acquisitions and internal growth the decrease in selling general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 1999 to 2000 is
primarily due to applying our existing overhead structure over an expanding
revenue base included in selling general and administrative expenses are fees
paid to autonation under the services agreement of 53 million for the year
ended december 31 1999 see note 12 related party transactions of the notes
to our consolidated financial statements for further information

     during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of 861 million on
an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of this pretax
amount 82 million was recorded to selling general and administrative
expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting
from the economic slowdown excluding the impact of this charge selling
general and administrative expenses for 2001 are 2283 million or 101 as a
percent of revenue the increase in selling general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional
management structure and various systems and training initiatives we believe
that selling general and administrative expenses in the range of 10 of revenue
is appropriate for 2002 given our business platform however selling general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending
upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown

     other charges  during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a charge of
861 million on an aftertax basis or 1320 million on a pretax basis of
this pretax amount 996 million was recorded to other charges which relates
primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and
noncore businesses and asset impairments

     other charges were 67 million for the year ended december 31 2000 these
charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south texas

     we recorded other charges of 69 million for the year ended december 31
1999 these charges relate to our separation from autonation they include 20
million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement
employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our
common stock at the date of grant see note 8 stock options of the notes to
our consolidated financial statements for further information they also include
49 million of other additional charges directly related to our separation

     operating income  operating income was 2835 million 4340 million and
3906 million or as a percentage of revenue 126 206 and 209 for the
years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively excluding the impact
of the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 our operating income
was 4155 or 184 as a percentage of revenue

     interest expense  we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit
facility unsecured notes and taxexempt bonds interest expense was 801
million 816 million and 642 million for the years ended december 31 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively the increase in interest expense from 1999 to 2000
is primarily due to an increase in average debt balances the increase is also
due to a general market increase in interest rates starting in the third quarter
of 1999 the decrease in interest expense from 2000 to 2001 is due to a general
market decrease in interest rates and an increase in taxexempt financings which
generally bear interest at lower rates than our revolving credit facility and
unsecured notes the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate
swap agreements that we entered into in september 2001

     capitalized interest was 33 million 29 million and 56 million for
the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

     interest and other income expense net  interest and other income net
of other expense was 59 million 40 million and 1 million for the years
ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the variances during the
periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash balances on hand and related
interest income and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2000 and 2001
the amount recorded for the year ended december 31 1999 includes a 29 million
loss on the sale of our collection and disposal business in costa rica

     income taxes  our provision for income taxes was 838 million 1354
million and 1257 million for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively our effective income tax rate was 400 380 and 385 for the
years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the increase in our
effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 is the result of certain nontax deductible
items included in the charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001
excluding the impact of this charge our effective tax rate for 2001 was 380

adjusted consolidated results of operations

     our adjusted net income was 2116 million or 124 per share for the
year ended december 31 2001 our adjusted operating results exclude an 861
million aftertax charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001 this
charge relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of
certain core and noncore businesses asset impairments downsizing our compost
mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments an increase in
insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense associated with the
economic slowdown

     the unaudited adjusted consolidated statement of operations is provided for
informational purposes only and does not project our companys results of
operations for any future date or period

     we recorded a 242 million charge to cost of operations during the fourth
quarter of 2001 this charge included a 133 million writedown associated with
the downsizing of our composting mulch and soil business the remainder of this
charge consists primarily of an increase in insurance reserves

     we recorded an 82 million charge to selling general and administrative
expenses this charge primarily relates to an increase in bad debt reserves
associated with the economic slowdown

     we also recorded 996 million to other charges this amount relates
primarily to the completed or planned divestitures of certain core and noncore
operations and asset impairments pursuant to a plan adopted by us during the
fourth quarter of 2001

     this plan includes divesting several collection and transfer station
operations resulting in a loss of approximately 520 million these operations
generated approximately 1 of our consolidated revenue during 2001 the sale of
a portion of these operations during 2001 generated cash proceeds of
approximately 26 million the sale of the remaining operations is expected to
generate cash proceeds of approximately 350 million

     our plans also include closing three of our smaller landfills these
landfills generated less than 2 of our consolidated revenue during 2001 in
addition we recorded an asset impairment for a fourth landfill in total we
recorded a loss of approximately 310 million associated with the early closure
of landfills or impairment charges

     the remaining amount recorded to other charges during the fourth quarter is
primarily for the planned disposition of excess assets approximately 10
million of the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter relates to ongoing
future lease commitments and other obligations associated with planned
divestitures

landfill and environmental matters

     among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our
landfills the additional disclosures included in this section provide the users
of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in
our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill
operations

     during 2000 we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted
in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was
consumed

     as of december 31 2001 we owned or operated 54 solid waste landfills with
total available disposal capacity estimated to be 17 billion inplace cubic
yards total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated
permitted airspace plus an estimate of airspace deemed by us to be likely to be
permitted these estimates are developed annually by independent engineers
together with our engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial
surveys as of december 31 2001 total available disposal capacity is estimated
to be 13 billion inplace cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 4 billion
inplace cubic yards of expansion airspace which has been determined by us as
likely to be permitted before airspace included in an expansion area is
determined as likely to be permitted and therefore included in our calculation
of total available disposal capacity it must meet our expansion criteria see
note 4 landfill and environmental costs of the notes to our consolidated
financial statements for further information

     as of december 31 2001 20 of our landfills meet the criteria for
including expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity at
projected annual volumes these 20 landfills have an estimated remaining average
site life of 33 years including the expansion airspace the average estimated
remaining life of all of our landfills is 35 years

     as of december 31 2001 nine of our landfills that meet the criteria for
including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and
are proceeding into the state permitting process also as of december 31 2001
five of our 20 landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace
had submitted permit applications to state authorities the remaining six
landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the
process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any
fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or
state level

     we have never been denied an expansion permit for a landfill that included
likely to be permitted airspace in its total available disposal capacity
although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted
as designed

  closure and postclosure costs

     the following table reflects our closure and postclosure expense per cubic
yard of airspace consumed for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999

cubic yards of airspace consumed in millions   325    325    271
closure and postclosure expense per cubic yard   70    72    66


     as of december 31 2001 accrued closure and postclosure costs were 2395
million the current portion of these costs of 211 million is reflected in our
consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities the longterm portion
of these costs of 2184 million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets
in accrued landfill and environmental costs as of december 31 2001 assuming
that all available landfill capacity is used we expect to expense approximately
4904 million of additional closure and postclosure costs over the remaining
lives of our facilities

     our estimates for closure and postclosure do not take into account
discounts for the present value of total estimated costs if total estimated
costs were discounted to present value they would be lower

     as of december 31 2001 we expect to spend an estimated additional 8911
million on existing landfills primarily related to cell construction and
environmental structures over their expected remaining lives our total
expected gross investment excluding nondepletable land estimated to be 17
billion or 97 per cubic yard is used in determining our depletion and
amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the unitsofconsumption
method our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take
into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs for
further information see closure and postclosure costs

     we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a
charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be
reasonably estimated we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation
activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as
a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill
purchase price allocated to airspace as appropriate no material amounts were
charged to expense during the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999

financial condition

     one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple costeffective
and transparent capital structure

     at december 31 2001 we had 161 million of cash and cash equivalents we
also had 1423 million of restricted cash of which 1152 million relates to
proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt

                                        39
page

financing that will be used to fund capital expenditures at december 31 2001
we had 2832 million of taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financing
outstanding at favorable interest rates

     in july 1998 we entered into a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit
facility with a group of banks 5000 million of the credit facility expires in
july 2002 and the remaining 5000 million expires in july 2003 borrowings
under the credit facility bear interest at liborbased rates we use our
operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our
working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and other
requirements as of december 31 2001 we had 6914 million of availability
under our credit facility as a result of our strong financial position and
liquidity in february 2002 we reduced the shortterm and longterm portion of
our credit facility by 2000 million and 500 million respectively

     in may 1999 we sold 6000 million of unsecured notes in the public
market 2250 million of these notes bear interest at 6 58 per annum and
mature in 2004 the remaining 3750 million bear interest at 7 18 per annum
and mature in 2009 interest on these notes is payable semiannually in may and
november the 2250 million and 3750 million in notes were offered at a
discount of 10 million and 5 million respectively proceeds from the notes
were used to repay our revolving credit facility

     in december 1999 we entered into a 1000 million operating lease facility
established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting
primarily of revenueproducing vehicles as of december 31 2001 790 million
was outstanding under this facility

     in august 2001 we sold 4500 million of unsecured notes in the public
market the notes bear interest at 6 34 per annum and mature in 2011 interest
on these notes is payable semiannually in february and august the notes were
offered at a discount of 26 million proceeds from the notes were used to
repay our revolving credit facility

     in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates in
september 2001 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment
grade rated financial institutions the swap agreements have a total notional
value of 2250 million and require our company to pay interest at floating
rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of
6 58 the swap agreements terminate in may 2004

     at december 31 2001 we had 2832 million of taxexempt bonds and other
taxexempt financings outstanding of which approximately 1561 million was
obtained during fiscal 2001 borrowings under these bonds and other financings
bear interest based on floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging
from 135 to 512 at december 31 2001 and have maturities ranging from 2002
to 2031 as of december 31 2001 we had 1152 million of restricted cash
related to proceeds from taxexempt bonds and other taxexempt financings this
restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the
agreements

     we plan to extend to july 2003 the maturity of our revolving shortterm
credit facility prior to its expiration in july 2002 we believe that such an
extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our
anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due we believe
that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing if
necessary to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions however
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under
favorable terms or to extend the existing shortterm credit facility on the same
terms

selected balance sheet accounts

     in 1999 we were the first in our industry to provide the users of our
financial statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance
sheet accounts these additional disclosures include schedules that show the
activity in our available airspace investment in landfills property and
equipment and other selected balance sheet accounts we believe that these
disclosures permit the readers of our financial statements to gain a better
understanding of our companys financial condition results of operations and
cash flows

     our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for
2000 and 2001 was 6 and 10 respectively this increase is due to the
economic slowdown that we experienced during 2001

     our expense for selfinsurance as a percentage of revenue for 2000 and 2001
was 43 and 49 respectively this increase is primarily due to an overall
increase in insurance costs that we experienced during 2001

     additions to accrued liabilities related to acquisitions are periodically
reviewed during the year subsequent to the acquisition during such reviews
accrued liabilities which are considered to be in excess of amounts required for
a specific acquisition are reversed and charged against goodwill cost in excess
of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to
airspace as appropriate

     as of december 31 2001 accounts receivable were 2329 million net of
allowance for doubtful accounts of 190 million resulting in days sales
outstanding of 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue in addition at
december 31 2001 our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled 188
million or 75 of gross receivables outstanding

b ebitda represents operating income plus depreciation amortization and
    depletion while ebitda data should not be construed as a substitute for
    operating income net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our
    operating performance financial position and cash flows we have included
    ebitda data which is not a measure of financial performance under generally
    accepted accounting principles because we believe that this data is
    commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a companys
    financial performance due to the fact that not all companies calculate
    nongaap measures in the same manner the ebitda presentation herein may not
    be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

     we believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies
and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our
company

operating lease facility

     one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple costeffective
and transparent capital structure

     as we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the
securities and exchange commission in december 1999 we entered into a 1000
million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment
consisting primarily of revenueproducing vehicles the facility has a term of
three years with two consecutive oneyear renewals and was entered into
primarily because its implicit interest rate

                                        44
page

was over ten basis points less than our revolving credit facility at the time
the facility meets the criteria of an operating lease under generally accepted
accounting principles accordingly we have not recorded this facility as debt
nor have we recorded the related operating equipment as assets on our balance
sheets however we have included the cost of operating equipment acquired under
the facility as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash
flow

     as of december 31 2001 790 million was outstanding under this facility
if this facility were treated as debt as of december 31 2001 our debt to total
capitalization would increase from 413 to 428 as a result of our success in
obtaining financing in the public markets including taxexempt bonds we do not
anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future

fuel hedge

     our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of diesel
fuel because the market for derivatives in diesel fuel is limited we have
entered into heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure
to fluctuations in diesel prices we have minimized our credit risk by entering
into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having investment grade
ratings our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities as amended in order to qualify for hedge
accounting certain criteria must be met including a requirement that both at
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the hedging relationship is
expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk during the term of the hedge

     under these option agreements we receive or make payments based on the
difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed
prices these option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a
predetermined fixed price in the option agreements but also limit our ability
to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the
option agreements

     during june 2001 we entered into option agreements for approximately 143
million gallons of heating oil these option agreements settle each month in
equal notional amounts through december 2002 the option agreements were
structured as zerocost collars indexed to the price of heating oil the fair
value of these option agreements at december 31 2001 was determined by third
parties to be a loss of approximately 28 million 17 million net of tax in
accordance with sfas 133 16 million representing the effective portion of
the change in fair value during the period has been recorded in stockholders
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax the
ineffective portion of the change in fair value was a loss of approximately 1
million for the year ended december 31 2001 and has been included in other
income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
realized losses of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2001 related to
these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our consolidated
statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial
instruments and constitutes a forwardlooking statement our major market risk
exposure is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in
libor we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination
of fixed and floating rate debt and through interest rate swaps all items
described below are nontrading

interest rates are variable and thus approximate current market rates

seasonality

which could delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of
waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and
other facilities

fair value and discounting obligations to reflect todays dollars this
statement requires a cumulative effect approach to recognizing transition
amounts for existing retirement obligations we are currently evaluating the
effect of adoption of this statement and have not determined whether the impact
of adoption will be material to our consolidated financial position or results
of operations

incentive plan to among other things increase the number of shares of our
common stock subject to the stock incentive plan to 27000000 shares the

the restrictions of the internal revenue code and the discrimination testing
that prevents meaningful accumulations for key highly compensated employees

compensation committee participants elect to make pretax payrolldeducted
salary andor bonus deferrals to the respective plans at the beginning of each
plan year at any percentage up to 25 including the amount contributed under

match amount in our common stock is available under this plan the match will be

dollar deferred up to a maximum of 4 of gross compensation inclusive of the
amounts funded within the 401k plan but not subject to irs limitations

item 13  certain relationships and related transactions

     before our initial public offering on july 1 1998 we had been a
whollyowned subsidiary of autonation autonation currently owns no shares of
our common stock mr huizenga is the chairman of the board of directors of
autonation and a member of the board of directors of anc rental corporation mr
hudson is the vice chairman and a director of autonation messrs huizenga and
hudson in the aggregate own in excess of 10 of autonation and anc rental
corporation as a result the following transactions between our company and
autonation and anc rental corporation may be deemed to be intercompany or
related party transactions

separation and distribution agreement

     the separation and distribution agreement that we entered into with
autonation in june 1998 provided for the principal corporate transactions
required to effect our separation from autonation and for other arrangements
governing the future relationship between our company and autonation the
agreement provides for indemnification by each party in favor of the other party
with respect to specified matters relating to the separation and distribution
agreement our initial public offering and the secondary offering of our common
stock owned by autonation the separation and distribution agreement also
provides for indemnifications between our company and autonation regarding
contingent liabilities primarily relating to our respective businesses or
otherwise assigned to our company and provides that the parties will each have
the exclusive right to any benefit received with respect to any contingent gain
that primarily relates to the business of that party or that is expressly
assigned to that party under the terms of the separation and distribution
agreement autonation has agreed that for a period of five years after we are
no longer a subsidiary of autonation autonation will not directly or indirectly
compete with us in the solid waste services industry anywhere in north america
and we have agreed that for a period of five years after that time we will not
directly or indirectly compete with autonation in the automotive retail or
vehicle rental industries anywhere in north america

tax indemnification and allocation agreement

     in connection with our separation from autonation we entered into a tax
indemnification and allocation agreement with autonation that provides that
autonation will indemnify us for income taxes that we might incur with respect
to certain internal restructuring transactions that we entered into in june 1998
in connection with our initial public offering

     we were included in autonations consolidated group for federal income tax
purposes for periods during which autonation beneficially owned at least 80 of
the total voting power and value of our outstanding common stock each
corporation that is a member of a consolidated group during any portion of the
groups tax year is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax
liability of the group for that year we and our subsidiaries stopped being
members of autonations consolidated group when we became a public company in
july 1998 the tax indemnification and allocation agreement allocates tax
liabilities between autonation and our company during the periods when we were
included in autonations consolidated group and provides each company rights of
indemnification

lease

     in july 1998 we signed a lease with a subsidiary of autonation for 10800
square feet of office space at autonations corporate headquarters in fort
lauderdale florida the annual lease rate is 220320 2040 per square foot
and we pay for certain common area maintenance charges

     effective january 1999 we amended the lease to increase the space we are
renting to 14443 square feet at an annual rate of 294637 2040 per square
foot the lease had an initial term of one year which we renewed in july 1999
for an additional one year term through june 2000 the rent includes utilities
security parking building maintenance and cleaning services

                                        87
page

     effective april 4 2000 we amended the lease further to increase the space
we are renting to 29217 square feet at an annual rate of 2040 per square foot
through december 31 2000 2354 per square foot from january 1 2001 through
december 31 2001 and thereafter increasing each year by 3 per square foot over
the prior years rate the lease runs through february 28 2003 we may
terminate the lease on 18 months written notice

     we believe that the lease is on terms no less favorable than could be
obtained from persons unrelated to our company

other transactions with autonation and anc rental corporation

     during 2001 we collected solid waste from and leased rolloff containers
to certain automotive retail and other properties of autonation we provided
all of these services at standard rates we continue to provide these services
to autonation on the same terms during 2001 we rented vehicles from anc rental
corporation under standard form vehicle rental agreements under which we were
charged standard rates

     in march 2000 we sold a lear jet 55 to autonation for approximately 47
million in january 2001 we purchased the lear jet 55 from autonation for
approximately 47 million which we believe approximated its fair market value

other transactions with related parties

     the following is a summary of other agreements and transactions that the
company is involved in with related parties it is the companys policy that
transactions with related parties must be on terms that on the whole are no
less favorable than those that would be available from unaffiliated parties it
is managements belief that all of these transactions met that standard at the
time such transactions were effected

     pro player stadium is a professional sports stadium in south florida that
is owned and controlled by mr huizenga one of our subsidiaries collected solid
waste from and leased rolloff waste containers to pro player stadium pursuant
to standard agreements under which pro player stadium paid an aggregate of
303297 in 2001 during 2001 one of our subsidiaries collected solid waste
from the national car rental center an arena in broward county florida which
was operated by a subsidiary of boca resorts inc until july 2001 for these
services our subsidiary was paid an aggregate of 93488 mr huizenga is the
chairman of and controls boca resorts inc and mr hudson is a director of boca
resorts inc we expect to continue to provide these services in 2002 on the
same terms
