while we are exiting noncore businesses we are investing in our core businesses in markets where we believe that gecc has deep domain experience and is competitively advantaged accordingly in the shortterm as we reduce our eni through exiting noncore businesses the overall level of our future net earnings may be reduced however over the longterm we believe that this strategy will improve our longterm performance through higher returns as we will have a larger concentration of assets in our core businesses as opposed to the underperforming or nonstrategic assets we will be exiting reduce liquidity risk as we pay down outstanding debt and diversify our sources of funding with less reliance on the global commercial paper markets and an increase in alternative sources of funding such as deposits and reduce capital requirements while strengthening capital ratios additional information about our liquidity and how we manage this risk can be found in the financial resources and liquidity section in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 “business” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

  

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the business descriptions in item 1 “business” and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

our growth is subject to global economic and political risks 

we operate in virtually every part of the world and serve customers in more than 100 countries in 2013 approximately 53 of our revenue was attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition and geopolitical risks they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these global economic and political risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation may decrease or become even more costly as a result of more volatile market conditions

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular us and nonus governments are undertaking a substantial revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and nonbank financial institutions consumer lending the overthecounter derivatives market and tax laws and regulations which changes may have an effect on ge’s and ge capital’s structure operations liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate and performance we are also subject to a number of trade control laws and regulations that may affect our ability to sell our products in global markets in addition we are subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local capital requirements that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with nonus financial institutions in global markets this provision which had expired at the end of 2011 was reinstated in january 2013 retroactively for two years through the end of 2013 this provision also had been scheduled to expire and had been extended by congress on six previous occasions but there can be no assurance that it will continue to be extended in the event the provision is not extended after 2013 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2014 in addition efforts by public and private sectors to control the growth of healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers continued government scrutiny including reviews of the us food and drug administration us fda medical device premarket authorization and postmarket surveillance processes may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in us and international governmental programs which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act we are subject to prudential oversight by the federal reserve including as a result of gecc’s designation as a nonbank systemically important financial institution which subjects us to increased and evolving regulatory requirements 

gecc is a regulated savings and loan holding company and in 2011 became subject to federal reserve board frb supervision under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act dfa in 2013 the us financial stability oversight council fsoc designated gecc as a nonbank systemically important financial institution nonbank sifi under the dfa as a result of this change in supervision and designation stricter prudential regulatory standards and supervision apply to gecc many of the rulemakings for supervision of nonbank sifis are not final and therefore the exact impact and implementation date remain uncertain these dfa rulemakings will require among other items enhanced capital and liquidity levels compliance with the comprehensive capital analysis and review regulations ccar compliance with counterparty credit exposure limits and the development of a resolution plan for submission to regulators the frb recently finalized regulations to revise and replace its current rules on capital adequacy and to extend capital regulations to savings and loan holding companies like gecc gecc will ultimately also become subject to the basel iii advanced capital rules that will be applicable to institutions with 250 billion or more in assets the frb has also indicated in a proposed rulemaking that it will require nonbank sifis to submit annual capital plans for review including institutions’ plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments while gecc is not yet subject to this regulation gecc’s capital allocation planning remains subject to frb review as a savings and loan holding company for additional information see liquidity and borrowings in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators and other governmental authorities which may in certain circumstances lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time 

  

the success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions joint ventures dispositions and restructurings  

with respect to acquisitions joint ventures and restructuring actions we may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition we may not achieve anticipated cost savings from restructuring actions which could result in lower margin rates we also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world including joint ventures where we may have a lesser degree of control over the business operations which may expose us to additional operational financial legal or compliance risks we also continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives for example delays in obtaining tax rulings and regulatory approvals or clearances and disruptions or volatility in the capital markets may impact our ability to complete the staged exit from our north american retail finance business as planned alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could affect our future financial results

sustained increases in pension and healthcare benefits costs may reduce our profitability 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we use to estimate pension expense for 2014 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant reduction or increase to equity at the end of 2013 the ge pension plan was underfunded on a us gaap basis by 47 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 52 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees may increase future funding obligations although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability 

conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of funding 

as disclosed in more detail in the liquidity and borrowings section in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report a large portion of our borrowings is in the form of commercial paper and longterm debt we continue to rely on the availability of the unsecured debt markets to access funding for term and commercial paper maturities for 2014 and beyond and to fund our operations without incurring additional us tax in addition we rely on the availability of the commercial paper markets to refinance maturing commercial paper debt throughout the year in order to further diversify our funding sources ge capital continues to expand its reliance on alternative sources of funding including bank deposits securitizations and other assetbased funding there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing the diversification of our funding sources or that the short and longterm credit markets will be available or if available that the cost of funding will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability factors that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding costs include a decreased reliance on shortterm funding such as commercial paper in favor of longerterm funding arrangements decreased capacity and increased competition among debt issuers increased competition for deposits in our affiliate banks’ markets and potential market disruptions or other impacts arising in the united states or europe from developments in sovereign debt situations if ge capital’s cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect its competitive position and result in lower net interest margins earnings and cash flows as well as lower returns on its shareowner’s equity and invested capital

a deterioration of conditions in the global economy the major industries we serve or the financial markets  or the soundness of financial institutions and governments we deal with may adversely affect our business and results of operations  

the business and operating results of our industrial businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions including conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare home building and other major industries we serve existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion as a result of business deterioration cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing due to slower global economic growth and other challenges affecting the global economy in particular the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and international economies an extended period of slow growth in the us or internationally that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers and the viability of their business service contract cancellations or customer dynamics such as early aircraft retirements or reduced energy demand in our power  water business could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if slower growth in the global economy continues for a significant period or there is significant deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets including real estate goodwill intangibles and tax assets deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase allowances for loan losses impairments or writeoffs which depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

in addition ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties including sovereign governments and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the value of collateral held cannot be realized through sale or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of cash on deposit and unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which are designed to limit credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting as of december 31 2013 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was aa the second highest of 22 rating categories with a stable outlook the longterm unsecured debt credit rating from moody’s investors service moody’s for ge was aa3 the fourth highest of 21 rating categories and for gecc was a1 the fifth highest of 21 credit ratings both with stable outlooks as of december 31 2013 ge and gecc’s shortterm credit rating from sp was a1 the highest rating category of six categories and from moody’s was p1 the highest rating category of four categories there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade which depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position

in the accompanying analysis of financial information we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission sec rules for such measures we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in the supplemental information section

we supplement our gaap net earnings and earnings per share eps reporting by also reporting operating earnings and operating eps nongaap measures operating earnings and operating eps include service costs and plan amendment amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee benefits earned operating earnings and operating eps exclude nonoperating pension costincome such as interest costs expected return on plan assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses we believe that this reporting provides better transparency to the employee benefit costs of our principal pension plans and company operating results

significant matters relating to our statement of earnings are explained below 

ge sales of product services were 448 billion in 2013 an increase of 3 compared with 2012 and operating profit from product services was 134 billion in 2013 an increase of 7 compared with 2012 both the sales and operating profit of product services increases were at oil  gas aviation energy management and transportation ge sales of product services were 434 billion in 2012 an increase of 4 compared with 2011 and operating profit from product services was 125 billion in 2012 an increase of 6 compared with 2011 both the sales and operating profit of product services increases were at power  water oil  gas transportation and energy management 

postretirement benefit plans costs were 60 billion 55 billion and 41 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively costs increased in 2013 and 2012 primarily due to the continued amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 528 at december 31 2010 to 421 and 396 at december 31 2011 and 2012 respectively 

  

29 

  

  

our discount rate for our principal pension plans at december 31 2013 was 485 which reflected current interest rates considering the current and target asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 75 for cost recognition in 2014 a reduction from the 80 we assumed in 2013 2012 and 2011 gaap provides for recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees see the critical accounting estimates section for additional information 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits to decrease in 2014 by approximately 13 billion as compared to 2013 primarily because of the effects of higher discount rates and lower loss amortization related to our principal pension plans partially offset by lower expected investment return on pension plan assets 

pension expense for our principal pension plans on a gaap basis was 44 billion 38 billion and 24 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively operating pension costs nongaap for these plans were 18 billion 17 billion and 14 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively operating earnings include service cost and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee service operating earnings exclude nonoperating pension costsincome such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses we expect operating pension costs for these plans will be about 14 billion in 2014 the expected decrease in operating pension costs is attributable primarily to the effects of higher discount rates and lower early retirement costs 

the ge pension plan was underfunded by 47 billion at the end of 2013 as compared to 133 billion at december 31 2012 the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligations of 52 billion and 55 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively our underfunding at yearend 2013 was significantly reduced as compared to 2012 as the effects of higher discount rates and higher investment returns 146 return in 2013 more than offset liability growth our principal pension plans discount rate increased from 396 at december 31 2012 to 485 at december 31 2013 which decreased the pension benefit obligation at yearend 2013 by approximately 68 billion our ge pension plan assets increased from 447 billion at the end of 2012 to 483 billion at december 31 2013 primarily driven by higher investment returns that were partially offset by benefit payments made during the year assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations 

on july 6 2012 the us government enacted the “moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act” which contained provisions that changed the interest rate methodology used to calculate employee retirement income security act erisa minimum pension funding requirements in the us this change reduced our nearterm annual cash funding requirements for the ge pension plan we contributed 04 billion to the ge pension plan in 2012 we did not contribute to the ge pension plan in 2013 

on an erisa basis our preliminary estimate is that the ge pension plan was approximately 97 funded at january 1 2014 we will contribute approximately 05 billion to the ge pension plan in 2014 our current estimate of the projected 2015 ge pension plan required contribution is approximately 24 billion 

at december 31 2013 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 25 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2012 was 39 billion this decrease was primarily attributable to higher discount rates and higher investment returns we expect to contribute 08 billion to our other pension plans in 2014 as compared to 07 billion in both 2013 and 2012 

the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was 90 billion and 109 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this decrease was primarily attributable to the effects of higher discount rates retiree health and life plans discount rate increased from 374 at december 31 2012 to 461 at december 31 2013 and lower costs from new healthcare supplier contracts we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis we expect to contribute 05 billion to these plans in 2014 compared with actual contributions of 05 billion in both 2013 and 2012

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other costs and expenses are primarily selling general and administrative expenses sga ge’s costs were 159 175 and 185 of total sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2013 decrease was primarily driven by the effects of global cost reduction initiatives both in the industrial segments and corporate as a result of our simplification efforts partially offset by increased acquisitionrelated costs and higher restructuring the 2012 decrease was driven by increased sales and the effects of global cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increased acquisitionrelated costs at ge 

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 101 billion 124 billion and 144 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 93 billion 116 billion and 138 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively gecc average borrowings declined from 2012 to 2013 and from 2011 to 2012 in line with changes in average gecc assets interest rates have decreased over the threeyear period primarily attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates gecc average borrowings were 3795 billion 4200 billion and 4505 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the gecc average composite effective interest rate was 24 in 2013 28 in 2012 and 31 in 2011 in 2013 gecc average assets of 5227 billion were 7 lower than in 2012 which in turn were 5 lower than in 2011 see the liquidity and borrowings section in this item for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax rates are also affected by tax incentives introduced in the us and other countries to encourage and support certain types of activity our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

ge and gecc file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecc tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge 

income taxes on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 42 in 2013 compared with 146 in 2012 and 285 in 2011 

our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because ge funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes in us or foreign law including the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

  

31 

  

  

our benefits from lowertaxed global operations increased to 40 billion in 2013 from 22 billion in 2012 principally because of the realization of benefits related to the sale of 685 of our swiss consumer finance bank cembra money bank ag cembra through an initial public offering ipo the realization of benefits for prioryear losses and the resolution of internal revenue service irs audits our benefits from lowertaxed global operations increased to 22 billion in 2012 from 21 billion in 2011 principally because of the realization of benefits for prioryear losses and a decrease in currentyear losses for which there was not a full tax benefit 

the benefit from lowertaxed global operations included 04 billion 01 billion and 01 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively due to audit resolutions our benefit from lowertaxed global operations included the effect of the lower foreign tax rate on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which provided a tax benefit of 25 billion 13 billion and 15 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively included in 2013 is a benefit from the indefinite investment of the eligible earnings from the sale of a portion of cembra the tax benefit from nonus income taxed at a local country rather than the us statutory tax rate is reported in the effective tax rate reconciliation in the caption “tax on global earnings including exports” in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report to the extent global interest rates and nonus operating income increase we would expect tax benefits to increase subject to management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings 

 

the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase in tax benefits on lowertaxed global operations including the tax benefit on the sale of a portion of cembra the effective tax rate was also lower due to favorable resolution of audit matters and lower income taxed at rates above the average tax rate partially offset by the absence of the 2012 benefit attributable to the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business property disposition 

the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 was due in significant part to the high effective tax rate in 2011 on the pretax gain on the nbc universal nbcu transaction with comcast corporation comcast discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k report this gain increased the 2011 consolidated effective tax rate by 129 percentage points the effective tax rate was also lower due to the benefit of the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business properties disposition 

cash income taxes paid in 2013 were 25 billion reflecting the effects of changes to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and the timing of tax payments to governments 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted and the law extended several provisions including a twoyear extension of the us tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income and certain us business credits retroactive to january 1 2012 under accounting rules a tax law change is taken into account in calculating the income tax provision in the period enacted because the extension was enacted into law in 2013 tax expense in 2013 reflected retroactive extension of the previously expired provisions 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecc and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecc net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecc earnings ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecc earnings from continuing operations were 88 billion 95 billion and 126 billion for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in earnings from 2011 to 2012 reflects the nonrepeat of the pretax gain on sale of nbcu and higher loss amortization related to our principal pension plans on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 189 in 2013 213 in 2012 and 383 in 2011

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2012 to 2013 primarily because of the benefit of audit resolutions shown above 

 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2011 to 2012 primarily because of the high effective tax rate in 2011 on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast reflecting the low tax basis in our investments in the nbcu business and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to our 49 investment in nbcuniversal llc nbcu llc see note 2 this gain increased the 2011 ge effective tax rate by 197 percentage points partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the ge effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 due to higher income taxed above the average rate and to the decrease in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

 

the gecc effective income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a tax benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because gecc funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

as noted above ge and gecc file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecc tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecc effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return ge makes cash payments to gecc for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due 

  

33 

  

  

the gecc effective tax rate was 136 in 2013 compared with 66 in 2012 comparing pretax income to a tax benefit resulted in a negative tax rate for 2013 the gecc tax expense decreased by 15 billion from an expense of 05 billion in 2012 to a benefit of 10 billion in 2013 the lower 2013 tax expense is attributable to increased benefits from lowtaxed global operations 17 billion including the significant tax benefit related to the sale of a portion of cembra 10 billion and the 2013 tax benefits related to the extension of the us tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income 03 billion also lowering the expense is the benefit from the resolution of the internal revenue service irs audit of the 20082009 tax years and items for other years 01 billion which is reported partially in the caption “tax on global activities including exports” and partially in the caption “all othernet” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the items lowering the expense are partially offset by the absence of the 2012 benefit attributable to the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business property disposition 03 billion 

the gecc effective tax rate was 66 in 2012 compared with 121 in 2011 the gecc tax expense of 05 billion in 2012 decreased by 04 billion from 09 billion in 2011 the lower 2012 tax expense resulted principally from the benefit attributable to the hightax basis in the entity sold in the business property disposition 03 billion increased benefits from lowtaxed global operations 02 billion and the absence of the 2011 hightaxed disposition of garanti bank 01 billion partially offsetting the decrease in tax expense was the absence in 2012 of the 2011 benefit from resolution of the 20062007 internal revenue service irs audit 02 billion which is reported in the caption “all othernet” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report and from higher pretax income of 03 billion that increased the tax expense 01 billion 

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization like ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated we evaluate risk at the individual transaction level and evaluate aggregated risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

risk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of management and are carried out through risk managers who are operationally integrated into each of our businesses these risk managers have acquired deep domain expertise through their long careers and proximity to the business’ operations and core processes both risk managers and the business leadership teams have specific riskfocused goals and objectives that are aligned with our overall risk framework 

the ge board of directors board has oversight for risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company including strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks at the end of each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to prioritize in the next year throughout the year the board and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail strategic operational and reputational risks are presented and discussed in the context of the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings and at presentations to the board and its committees by the vice chairmen ge and gecc chief risk officers cros general counsel and other employees the board has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific risks to board committees as follows

the ge board’s risk oversight process builds upon management’s risk assessment and mitigation processes which include standardized reviews of longterm strategic and operational planning executive development and evaluation code of conduct compliance under the company’s the spirit  the letter regulatory compliance health safety and environmental compliance financial reporting and controllership and information technology and security a vicechairman of ge and ge’s cro are responsible for overseeing and coordinating risk assessment and mitigation on an enterprisewide basis they lead the corporate risk function and are responsible for the identification of key business risks providing for appropriate management of these risks within ge board guidelines and enforcement through policies and procedures in 2013 the company combined its risk evaluation process with its quarterly operating reviews to simplify the company’s operating rhythm and added a vice chairman position with responsibility for both enterprise risk and operations the policy compliance review board is a managementlevel committee that further assists in assessing and mitigating risk the policy compliance review board which conducted four compliance operating reviews and met seven times in 2013 is chaired by the company’s general counsel and includes the chief financial officer and other seniorlevel functional leaders it has principal responsibility for monitoring compliance matters across the company 

ges corporate risk function leverages the risk infrastructures in each of our businesses which have adopted an approach that corresponds to the company’s overall risk policies guidelines and review mechanisms our risk infrastructure operates at the business and functional levels and is designed to identify evaluate and mitigate risks within each of the following categories 

 

 

 

 

  

35 

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

risks identified through our risk management processes are prioritized and depending on the probability and severity of the risk escalated to the cro these risks are discussed and responsibility for them is assigned to the business or functional leader most suited to manage the risk in connection with the quarterly operating reviews assigned owners are required to continually monitor evaluate and report on risks for which they bear responsibility enterprise risk leaders within each business and corporate function are responsible to present to the cro risk assessments and key risks at least annually we have general response strategies for managing risks which categorize risks according to whether the company will avoid transfer reduce or accept the risk these response strategies are tailored to ensure that risks are within acceptable ge board general guidelines 

depending on the nature of the risk involved and the particular business or function affected we use a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies including delegation of authorities standardized processes and strategic planning reviews operating reviews insurance and hedging as a matter of policy we generally hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our service businesses employ a comprehensive tollgate process leading up to and through the execution of a contractual service agreement to mitigate legal financial and operational risks furthermore we centrally manage some risks by purchasing insurance the amount of which is determined by balancing the level of risk retained or assumed with the cost of transferring risk to others we manage the risk of fluctuations in economic activity and customer demand by monitoring industry dynamics and responding accordingly including by adjusting capacity implementing cost reductions and engaging in mergers acquisitions and dispositions

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses acquisition costs and other related charges technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team see corporate items and eliminations for certain amounts not allocated to ge operating segments because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for external purposes 

segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries gecc preferred stock dividends declared and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured these costs are excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for power  water oil  gas energy management aviation healthcare transportation and appliances  lighting and are included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for ge capital certain corporate costs such as shared services employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment’s relative net cost of operations prior to january 1 2011 segment profit excluded the effects of principal pension plans beginning january 1 2011 we began allocating service costs related to our principal pension plans and no longer allocate the retiree costs of our postretirement healthcare benefits to our segments this revised allocation methodology better aligns segment operating costs to the active employee costs which are managed by the segments this change does not significantly affect reported segment results

geographic operations 

 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new opportunities that include among other things more opportunities for expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis the us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas we classify certain assets that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose 

 

nonus revenues were 774 billion in 2013 compared with 762 billion and 766 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively nonus revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 53 in 2013 compared with 52 in both 2012 and 2011 

  

ge nonus revenues excluding gecc in 2013 were 590 billion up 3 over 2012 increases in growth markets of 72 in algeria 38 in subsahara and 7 in china offset a decrease of 9 in europe these revenues as a percentage of ge total revenues excluding gecc were 58 in 2013 compared with 57 and 55 in 2012 and 2011 respectively ge nonus revenues excluding gecc were 573 billion in 2012 up 5 from 2011 primarily resulting from increases of 22 in australia and new zealand 20 in china and 8 in latin america partially offset by a decrease of 36 in india the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results decreased revenues by 03 billion in 2013 primarily driven by the japanese yen 03 billion and brazilian real 02 billion partially offset by the euro 04 billion the effect of currency fluctuations on reported results decreased revenues by 19 billion in 2012 primarily driven by the euro 14 billion and brazilian real 02 billion the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results increased revenues by 14 billion in 2011 primarily driven by the euro 08 billion and japanese yen 02 billion

gecc nonus revenues decreased 3 to 184 billion in 2013 compared with 190 billion and 223 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily as a result of decreases in europe nonus revenues as a percentage of total revenues were 42 in 2013 and 2012 compared with 46 in 2011 nonus revenues decreased by 15 in 2012 from 223 billion in 2011 primarily as a result of decreases in europe the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results decreased revenues by 02 billion in 2013 primarily driven by the japanese yen 02 billion the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results decreased revenues by 07 billion in 2012 primarily driven by the euro 03 billion polish zloty 01 billion hungarian forint 01 billion and czech koruna 01 billion the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results increased revenues by 10 billion in 2011 primarily driven by the australian dollar 03 billion euro 02 billion japanese yen 01 billion canadian dollar 01 billion and british pound 01 billion 

the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were minimal with no single currency having a significant impact 

 

total assets of nonus operations on a continuing basis were 3288 billion in 2013 a decrease of 22 billion from 2012 this decrease reflected declines in pacific basin and other global primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and dispositions at various businesses partially offset by increases in europe primarily due to acquisitions 

financial results of our nonus activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen the swiss franc and the australian dollar 

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 04 billion in both 2013 and 2012 and 03 billion in 2011 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about 04 billion for each of the next two years

in 2006 we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency epa to dredge pcbcontaining sediment from the upper hudson river the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009 between phase 1 and phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts the panel evaluated the performance of phase 1 dredging operations with respect to phase 1 engineering performance standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards on december 17 2010 epa issued its decision setting forth the final performance standards for phase 2 of the hudson river dredging project incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from ge in december 2010 we agreed to perform phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by epa and increased our reserve by 08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing phase 2 in 2011 we completed the first year of phase 2 dredging and commenced work on planned upgrades to the hudson river wastewater processing facility over the past three years we have dredged 17 million cubic yards from the river and based upon that result and our best professional engineering judgment we believe that our current reserve continues to reflect our probable and estimable costs for the remainder of phase 2 of the dredging project

because ge and gecc share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position – property plant and equipment and borrowings for example – the following discussion addresses significant captions in the consolidated statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecc activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

investment securities comprise mainly investmentgrade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations and supporting obligations to holders of guaranteed investment contracts gics in trinity and investments held in our cll business collateralized by senior secured loans of highquality middlemarket companies in a variety of industries the fair value of investment securities decreased to 440 billion at december 31 2013 from 485 billion at december 31 2012 primarily due to the sale of us government and federal agency securities at our treasury operations and the impact of higher interest rates at december 31 2013 we held debt securities with an estimated fair value of 433 billion which included corporate debt securities assetbacked securities abs commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs and residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs with estimated fair values of 235 billion 74 billion 30 billion and 19 billion respectively net unrealized gains on debt securities were 25 billion and 48 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively this amount included unrealized losses on corporate debt securities state and municipal securities and cmbs of 03 billion 02 billion and 01 billion respectively at december 31 2013 as compared with 04 billion 01 billion and 01 billion respectively at december 31 2012

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria for debt securities our qualitative review considers our intent to sell the security and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security our quantitative review considers whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows unrealized losses are not indicative of the amount of credit loss that would be recognized we presently do not intend to sell the vast majority of our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the vast majority of these securities before recovery of our amortized cost for equity securities we consider the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position we believe that the unrealized loss associated with our equity securities will be recovered within the foreseeable future uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments for additional information relating to how credit losses are calculated see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our rmbs portfolio is collateralized primarily by pools of individual direct mortgage loans a majority of which were originated in 2006 and 2005 not other structured products such as collateralized debt obligations the vast majority of our rmbs are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals and more than 70 are agency bonds or insured by monoline insurers monolines on which we continue to place reliance of our total rmbs portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 04 billion and 05 billion respectively relates to residential subprime credit primarily supporting our guaranteed investment contracts a majority of this exposure is related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 substantially all of the subprime rmbs were investment grade at the time of purchase and approximately 70 have been subsequently downgraded to below investment grade 

our cmbs portfolio is collateralized by both diversified pools of mortgages that were originated for securitization conduit cmbs and pools of large loans backed by highquality properties large loan cmbs the majority of which were originated in 2007 and 2006 the vast majority of the securities in our cmbs portfolio have investmentgrade credit ratings and the vast majority of the securities are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals 

our abs portfolio is collateralized by senior secured loans of highquality middlemarket companies in a variety of industries as well as a variety of diversified pools of assets such as student loans and credit cards the vast majority of the securities in our abs portfolio are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals in addition substantially all of the securities that are below investment grade are in an unrealized gain position 

if there has been an adverse change in cash flows for rmbs management considers credit enhancements such as monoline insurance which are features of a specific security in evaluating the overall creditworthiness of the monoline we use an analysis that is similar to the approach we use for corporate bonds including an evaluation of the sufficiency of the monoline’s cash reserves and capital ratings activity whether the monoline is in default or default appears imminent and the potential for intervention by an insurance or other regulator 

monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities primarily rmbs and municipal securities the credit enhancement is a feature of each specific security that guarantees the payment of all contractual cash flows and is not purchased separately by ge the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities we continue to rely on monolines with adequate capital and claims paying resources we have reduced our reliance on monolines that do not have adequate capital or have experienced regulator intervention at december 31 2013 our investment securities insured by monolines on which we continue to place reliance were 10 billion including 03 billion of our 04 billion investment in subprime rmbs at december 31 2013 the unrealized loss associated with securities subject to monoline credit enhancement for which there is an expected credit loss was 01 billion 

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during 2013 were 08 billion which was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on corporate debt securities and otherthantemporary losses on equity securities and an insignificant amount primarily relates to noncreditrelated losses on rmbs and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income aoci

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during 2012 were 02 billion of which 01 billion was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on nonus corporate us corporate and rmbs securities and otherthantemporary losses on equity securities and 01 billion primarily relates to noncreditrelated losses on rmbs and is included within aoci 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 unrealized losses on investment securities totaled 07 billion and 08 billion respectively including 04 billion and 08 billion respectively aged 12 months or longer of the amount aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2013 more than 70 are debt securities that were considered to be investment grade by the major rating agencies in addition of the amount aged 12 months or longer 01 billion and 02 billion related to structured securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked and corporate debt securities respectively with respect to our investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2013 the majority relate to debt securities held to support obligations to holders of gics we presently do not intend to sell the vast majority of our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of our amortized cost for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date additional information about our application of this guidance is provided in notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report at december 31 2013 the aggregate amount of investments that are measured at fair value through earnings totaled 32 billion and consisted primarily of various assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business as well as equity investments 

working capital representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections decreased 07 billion at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 due to increases in accounts payable and progress collections partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory as power  water oil  gas and aviation deliver units out of their backlogs to fulfill commitments over the next few years progress collections of 132 billion at december 31 2013 will be earned which along with progress collections on new orders will impact working capital we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

current receivables before allowance for losses for ge totaled to 114 billion at december 31 2013 and 97 billion at december 31 2012 and included 74 billion due from customers at the end of 2013 compared with 63 billion at the end of 2012 ge current receivables turnover was 99 in 2013 compared with 105 in 2012 the overall increase in current receivables was primarily due to higher volume at power  water and oil  gas see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

inventories for ge totaled 173 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 20 billion from 2012 this increase reflected higher inventories at power  water oil  gas and aviation to fulfill commitments and backlog ge inventory turnover was 61 and 67 in 2013 and 2012 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows 

  

50 

  

our consumer portfolio is composed primarily of nonus mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries and us consumer credit card and sales finance receivables in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans 

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes which for our cll business primarily include industrialrelated facilities and equipment vehicles corporate aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation media communications entertainment and healthcare industries the portfolios in our real estate gecas and energy financial services businesses are collateralized by commercial real estate commercial aircraft and operating assets in the global energy and water industries respectively we are in a secured position for substantially all of our commercial portfolio 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examinations process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible to experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio as a result the allowance for losses is not carried over at acquisition this may have the effect of causing lower reserve coverage ratios for those portfolios 

for purposes of the discussion that follows “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection is otherwise doubtful nonearning receivables exclude loans purchased at a discount unless they have deteriorated post acquisition these loans are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition in addition nonearning receivables exclude loans that are paying on a cash accounting basis but are classified as nonaccrual and impaired “nonaccrual” financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due with the exception of consumer credit card accounts on which we accrue interest until the account becomes 180 days past due as discussed below recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms but may remain classified as nonaccrual until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection 

  

51 

  

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 we revised our methods for classifying financing receivables as nonaccrual and nonearning to more closely align with regulatory guidance under the revised methods we continue to accrue interest on consumer credit cards until the accounts are written off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due previously we stopped accruing interest on consumer credit cards when the account became 90 days past due in addition the revised methods limit the use of the cash basis of accounting for nonaccrual financing receivables 

as a result of these revisions consumer credit card receivables of 11 billion that were previously classified as both nonaccrual and nonearning were returned to accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition 15 billion of real estate and cll financing receivables previously classified as nonaccrual paying in accordance with contractual terms and accounted for on the cash basis were returned to accrual status while 22 billion of financing receivables previously classified as nonaccrual and accounted for on the cash basis primarily in real estate and cll were placed into the nonearning category based on our assessment of the shortterm outlook for resolution through payoff or refinance these changes had an insignificant effect on earnings 

given that the revised methods result in nonaccrual and nonearning amounts that are substantially the same we plan to discontinue the reporting of nonearning financing receivables one of our internal performance metrics and report selected ratios related to nonaccrual financing receivables in the first quarter of 2014 

further information on the determination of the allowance for losses on financing receivables and the credit quality and categorization of our financing receivables is provided in the critical accounting estimates section in this item and notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 258  2 billion at december 31 2013 and 2731 billion at december 31 2012 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 149 billion from december 31 2012 primarily as a result of dispositions 65 billion writeoffs 59 billion collections which includes sales exceeding originations 36 billion and the stronger us dollar 17 billion 

related nonearning receivables totaled 72 billion 28 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2013 compared with 75 billion 28 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2012 nonearning receivables decreased from december 31 2012 primarily due to collections and writeoffs at cll and the placing of consumer credit card accounts on accrual status partially offset by nonearning receivables previously classified as cash basis resulting from a revision to our nonaccrual and nonearning methods to more closely align with regulatory guidance in the fourth quarter of 2013 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2013 totaled 52 billion compared with 49 billion at december 31 2012 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio allowance for losses increased 02 billion from december 31 2012 primarily because provisions were higher than writeoffs net of recoveries by 04 billion which is attributable to an increase in provision in our consumer installment and revolving portfolios the allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables increased from 18 at december 31 2012 to 20 at december 31 2013 primarily due to an increase in the allowance for losses and a decline in the overall financing receivables balance as discussed above further information surrounding the allowance for losses related to each of our portfolios is detailed below

the following table provides information surrounding selected ratios related to nonearning financing receivables and the allowance for losses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included below is a discussion of financing receivables allowance for losses nonearning receivables and related metrics for each of our significant portfolios 

cll – americas  nonearning receivables of 12 billion represented 172 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 368 at december 31 2012 to 381 at december 31 2013 reflecting a decrease in nonearning receivables the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables remained constant at 18 at december 31 2013 primarily due to decreased nonearning exposures in our industrial and consumerfacing portfolios partially offset by our materials media and latin america portfolios collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables primarily includes assets in the restaurant and hospitality trucking and industrial equipment industries and corporate aircraft and for our leveraged finance business equity of the underlying businesses

cll – europe   nonearning receivables of 10 billion represented 145 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 343 at december 31 2012 to 397 at december 31 2013 reflecting a decrease in nonearning receivables and allowance for losses in our interbanca spa and assetbacked lending portfolios primarily as a result of writeoffs the majority of our cll – europe nonearning receivables are attributable to the interbanca spa portfolio which was acquired in 2009 the loans acquired with interbanca spa were recorded at fair value which incorporates an estimate at the acquisition date of credit losses over their remaining life accordingly these loans generally have a lower ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables compared to the remaining portfolio excluding the nonearning loans attributable to the 2009 acquisition of interbanca spa the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 584 at december 31 2012 to 708 at december 31 2013 primarily due to a decrease in nonearning receivables as a result of writeoffs and sales in our acquisition finance and assetbacked lending portfolios the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 35 at december 31 2012 to 28 at december 31 2013 for the reasons described above collateral supporting these secured nonearning financing receivables are primarily equity of the underlying businesses for our interbanca spa business and acquisition finance businesses the purchased receivables for our assetbacked lending portfolio and equipment for our equipment finance portfolio 

cll – asia nonearning receivables of 04 billion represented 57 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 415 at december 31 2012 to 218 at december 31 2013 primarily due to an increase in nonearning receivables in australia south korea and thailand partially offset by restructuring activities and writeoffs resulting in a reduction of nonearning receivables in our assetbased financing businesses in japan the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables increased from 17 at december 31 2012 to 44 at december 31 2013 primarily due to increased nonearning receivables mentioned above and a decline in financing receivables primarily in our assetbased financing businesses in japan and australia collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables is primarily commercial real estate manufacturing equipment and corporate aircraft 

real estate – debt nonearning receivables of 23 billion represented 318 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the increase in nonearning receivables from december 31 2012 was primarily due to 21 billion of financing receivables previously classified as cash basis resulting from a revision to our nonaccrual and nonearning methods to more closely align with regulatory guidance in the fourth quarter of 2013 partially offset by the resolution of north american multifamily and hotel nonearning loans as well as european retail and mixeduse loans through payoffs foreclosures and writeoffs the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 721 to 83 reflecting the increase in nonearning loans as mentioned above the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables decreased from 15 at december 31 2012 to 10 at december 31 2013 driven primarily by the reduction in overall reserves due to improving market conditions and new loan originations in 2013 

the real estate financing receivables portfolio is collateralized by incomeproducing or owneroccupied commercial properties across a variety of asset classes and markets at december 31 2013 total real estate financing receivables of 199 billion were primarily collateralized by office buildings 59 billion apartment buildings 32 billion retail facilities 28 billion warehouse properties 26 billion and hotel properties 22 billion in 2013 commercial real estate markets continue to show signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market and the longterm outlook remains uncertain we have and continue to maintain an intense focus on operations and risk management loan loss reserves related to our real estate–debt financing receivables are particularly sensitive to declines in underlying property values estimating the impact of global property values on loss performance across our portfolio depends on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions property level operating performance local market dynamics and individual borrower behavior as a result any attempts to forecast potential losses carry a high degree of imprecision and are subject to change at december 31 2013 we had 116 foreclosed commercial real estate properties totaling 10 billion

consumer − nonus residential mortgages nonearning receivables of 18 billion represented 244 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 187 at december 31 2012 to 203 at december 31 2013 as a result of lower nonearning receivables due to improved collections and higher property values primarily in our uk portfolio our nonus mortgage portfolio has a loantovalue ratio of approximately 75 at origination and the vast majority are first lien positions our uk and france portfolios which comprise a majority of our total mortgage portfolio have reindexed loantovalue ratios of 77 and 56 respectively and about 9 of these loans are without mortgage insurance and have a reindexed loantovalue ratio equal to or greater than 100 reindexed loantovalue ratios may not reflect actual realizable values of future repossessions   loantovalue information is updated on a quarterly basis for a majority of our loans and considers economic factors such as the housing price index at december 31 2013 we had in repossession stock 447 houses in the uk which had a value of approximately 01 billion the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 77 at december 31 2012 to 58 at december 31 2013 for the reasons described above 

consumer − nonus installment and revolving credit nonearning receivables of 01 billion represented 12 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 2732 at december 31 2012 to 6750 at december 31 2013  reflecting an increase in the allowance for losses primarily due to the approach described below and a decrease in nonearning receivables reflect the placing of consumer credit card accounts on accrual status 

consumer − us installment and revolving credit nonearning receivables at december 31 2013 reflect the placing of consumer credit card accounts on accrual status the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of financing receivables increased from 45 at december 31 2012 to 51 at december 31 2013 reflecting an increase in the allowance for losses primarily due to the approach described below 

in 2013 we completed our implementation of a more granular portfolio segmentation approach by loss type in determining the incurred loss period in our consumer revolving credit portfolios which resulted in an increase to the incurred loss period and included a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the consumer revolving credit portfolios’ allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net writeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance this resulted in an increase of 06 billion to the allowance for losses on financing receivables 03 billion after tax the vast majority of which was attributable to our us consumer revolving credit portfolios 

 

nonaccrual financing receivables 

 

the following table provides details related to our nonaccrual and nonearning financing receivables nonaccrual financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due with the exception of consumer credit card accounts as discussed below 

 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 we revised our methods for classifying financing receivables as nonaccrual and nonearning to more closely align with regulatory guidance under the revised methods we continue to accrue interest on consumer credit cards until the accounts are written off in the period the account becomes 180 days past due previously we stopped accruing interest on consumer credit cards when the account became 90 days past due in addition the revised methods limit the use of the cash basis of accounting for nonaccrual financing receivables 

 

as a result of these revisions consumer credit card receivables of 11 billion that were previously classified as both nonaccrual and nonearning were returned to accrual status in the fourth quarter of 2013 in addition 15 billion of real estate and cll financing receivables previously classified as nonaccrual paying in accordance with contractual terms and accounted for on the cash basis were returned to accrual status while 22 billion of financing receivables previously classified as nonaccrual and accounted for on the cash basis primarily in real estate and cll were placed into the nonearning category based on our assessment of the shortterm outlook for resolution through payoff or refinance these changes had an insignificant effect on earnings 

  

57 

  

 

given that the revised methods result in nonaccrual and nonearning amounts that are substantially the same we plan to discontinue the reporting of nonearning financing receivables one of our internal performance metrics and report selected ratios related to nonaccrual financing receivables in the first quarter of 2014 

 

substantially all of the differences between nonearning and nonaccrual financing receivables relate to loans that are classified as nonaccrual financing receivables but are paying on a cash accounting basis and therefore excluded from nonearning receivables of our 79 billion nonaccrual loans at december 31 2013 42 billion are currently paying in accordance with their contractual terms further information on our nonaccrual and nonearning financing receivables is provided in notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impaired loans 

 

“impaired” loans in the table below are defined as largerbalance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement the vast majority of our consumer and a portion of our cll nonaccrual receivables are excluded from this definition as they represent smallerbalance homogeneous loans that we evaluate collectively by portfolio for impairment 

impaired loans include nonearning receivables on largerbalance or restructured loans loans that are currently paying interest under the cash basis but are excluded from the nonearning category and loans paying currently that had been previously restructured 

specific reserves are recorded for individually impaired loans to the extent we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement certain loans classified as impaired may not require a reserve because we believe that we will ultimately collect the unpaid balance through collection or collateral repossession 

further information pertaining to loans classified as impaired and specific reserves is included in the table below

we regularly review our real estate loans for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors such as debt service coverage and loantovalue ratios we evaluate a real estate loan for impairment when the most recent valuation reflects a projected loantovalue ratio at maturity in excess of 100 even if the loan is currently paying in accordance with its contractual terms 

of our 39 billion of impaired loans at real estate at december 31 2013 36 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and are typically loans where the borrower has adequate debt service coverage to meet contractual interest obligations impaired loans at cll primarily represent senior secured lending positions 

our impaired loan balance at december 31 2013 and 2012 classified by the method used to measure impairment was as follows 

 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions forbearance or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr and also as impaired changes to real estate’s loans primarily include maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions of our commercial loans meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances at december 31 2013 tdrs included in impaired loans were 95 billion primarily relating to real estate 36 billion cll 30 billion and consumer 29 billion 

  

59 

  

real estate tdrs decreased from 51 billion at december 31 2012 to 36 billion at december 31 2013 primarily driven by resolution of tdrs through paydowns partially offset by extensions of loans scheduled to mature during 2013 some of which were classified as tdrs upon modification for borrowers with demonstrated operating capabilities we work to restructure loans when the cash flow and projected value of the underlying collateral support repayment over the modified term we deem loan modifications to be tdrs when we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty and we do not receive adequate compensation in the form of an effective interest rate that is at current market rates of interest given the risk characteristics of the loan or other consideration that compensates us for the value of the concession for the year ended december 31 2013 we modified 16 billion of loans classified as tdrs substantially all in our debt portfolio changes to these loans primarily included maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral or covenant terms and cash sweeps that are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the limited liquidity and higher return requirements in the real estate market for loans with higher loantovalue ltv ratios have typically resulted in the conclusion that the modified terms are not at current market rates of interest even if the modified loans are expected to be fully recoverable we received the same or additional compensation in the form of rate increases and fees for the majority of these tdrs of our 16 billion and 44 billion of modifications classified as tdrs in the last 12 months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 02 billion have subsequently experienced a payment default in both 2013 and 2012 

the substantial majority of the real estate tdrs have reserves determined based upon collateral value our specific reserves on real estate tdrs were 01 billion at december 31 2013 and 02 billion at december 31 2012 and were 19 and 31 respectively of real estate tdrs in many situations these loans did not require a specific reserve as collateral value adequately covered our recorded investment in the loan while these modified loans had adequate collateral coverage we were still required to complete our tdr classification evaluation on each of the modifications without regard to collateral adequacy 

we utilize certain shortterm three months or less loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary financial difficulties in our consumer loan portfolio these loan modification programs are primarily concentrated in our nonus residential mortgage and nonus installment and revolving portfolios we sold our us residential mortgage business in 2007 and as such do not participate in the us governmentsponsored mortgage modification programs for the year ended december 31 2013 we provided shortterm modifications of approximately 01 billion of consumer loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties substantially all in our nonus residential mortgage credit card and personal loan portfolios which are not classified as tdrs for these modified loans we provided insignificant interest rate reductions and payment deferrals which were not part of the terms of the original contract we expect borrowers whose loans have been modified under these shortterm programs to continue to be able to meet their contractual obligations upon the conclusion of the shortterm modification in addition we have modified 14 billion of consumer loans for the year ended december 31 2013 which are classified as tdrs further information on consumer impaired loans is provided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

gecc selected european exposures 

 

at december 31 2013 we had 818 billion in financing receivables to consumer and commercial customers in europe the gecc financing receivables portfolio in europe is well diversified across european geographies and customers approximately 88 of the portfolio is secured by collateral and represents approximately 500000 commercial customers several european countries including spain portugal ireland italy greece and hungary focus countries have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations the carrying value of gecc funded exposures in these focus countries and in the rest of europe comprised the following at december 31 2013

we manage counterparty exposure including credit risk on an individual counterparty basis we place defined risk limits around each obligor and review our risk exposure on the basis of both the primary and parent obligor as well as the issuer of securities held as collateral these limits are adjusted on an ongoing basis based on our continuing assessment of the credit risk of the obligor or issuer in setting our counterparty risk limits we focus on highquality credits and diversification through spread of risk in an effort to actively manage our overall exposure we actively monitor each exposure against these limits and take appropriate action when we believe that risk limits have been exceeded or there are excess risk concentrations our collateral position and ability to work out problem accounts have historically mitigated our actual loss experience delinquency experience has been relatively stable in our european commercial and consumer platforms in the aggregate and we actively monitor and take action to reduce exposures where appropriate uncertainties surrounding european markets could have an impact on the judgments and estimates used in determining the carrying value of these assets 

 

other gecc receivables totaled 165 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 26 billion from 2012 driven by higher amounts due from ge related to material procurement and factoring programs at december 31 2013 the balance was primarily composed of amounts due from ge related to material procurement programs and factoring programs of 67 billion insurance receivables accrued interest and investment income nonfinancing customer receivables and amounts due under operating leases 

property plant and equipment totaled 688 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 02 billion from 2012 primarily reflecting an increase in machinery and equipment at ge partially offset by a decrease in equipment leased to others principally at our gecas aircraft leasing business this decrease included impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 07 billion and 02 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively impairment losses in 2013 incorporated management’s downward revisions to cash flow estimates based upon shorter useful lives and lower aircraft residual values from those indicated by our thirdparty appraisers reflecting the introduction of newer technology fleet retirements and high fuel prices and operating costs these revised estimates primarily related to cargo aircraft 03 billion older technology narrow body aircraft 02 billion and regional jets 01 billion the average age of aircrafts we impaired in 2013 was 15 years compared with 7 years for our total fleet 

ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecc was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge additions to property plant and equipment totaled 37 billion and 39 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively total expenditures excluding equipment leased to others for the past five years were 142 billion of which 43 was investment for growth through new capacity and product development 22 was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements and 35 was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection 

 

gecc additions to property plant and equipment were 100 billion and 119 billion during 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily reflecting additions of commercial aircraft at gecas 

goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 776 billion and 143 billion respectively at december 31 2013 goodwill increased 45 billion and other intangible assets increased 23 billion from 2012 primarily from the acquisitions of the aerospaceparts business of avio spa avio and lufkin industries inc lufkin goodwill increased 08 billion from 2011 primarily from the acquisitions of industrea limited and railcar management inc and the weaker us dollar other intangible assets decreased 01 billion from 2011 primarily from dispositions and amortization expense partially offset by acquisitions see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

all other assets comprises mainly equity and cost method investments real estate equity properties and investments assets held for sale and derivative instruments and totaled 708 billion at december 31 2013 a decrease of 308 billion from 2012 primarily related to the sale of our remaining investment in nbcu llc 189 billion certain heldforsale real estate and aircraft 79 billion the sale of certain real estate investments 34 billion a decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments 24 billion and a decrease in our penske truck leasing co lp ptl investment 12 billion partially offset by an increase in contract costs and estimated earnings 15 billion during 2013 we recognized 05 billion of otherthantemporary impairments of cost and equity method investments excluding those related to real estate 

included in other assets are real estate equity investments of 137 billion and 207 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type we review the estimated values of our commercial real estate investments annually or more frequently as conditions warrant based on the most recent valuation estimates available the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 21 billion this amount is subject to variation and dependent on economic and market conditions changes in cash flow estimates and composition of our portfolio including sales commercial real estate valuations have shown signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets primarily in the us however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market accordingly there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses during 2013 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 03 billion in its real estate held for investment which were primarily driven by declining cash flow projections for properties in japan and europe as well as strategic decisions to sell portfolios in the us asia and europe during 2012 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 01 billion real estate investments with undiscounted cash flows in excess of carrying value of 0 to 5 at december 31 2013 had a carrying value of 04 billion and an associated estimated unrealized loss of an insignificant amount deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized on march 19 2013 in connection with ge’s sale of its remaining 49 interest in nbcuniversal llc to comcast corporation we sold real estate comprising certain floors located at 30 rockefeller center new york and the cnbc property located in englewood cliffs new jersey to affiliates of nbcuniversal for 14 billion in cash

liquidity and borrowings 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity at both ge and gecc we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles 

our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and gecc are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes at ge our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment payroll and general expenses including pension funding we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives including paying dividends repurchasing shares investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses at ge we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities any dividend payments from gecc and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the us principally within fiscal quarters during 2013 gecc paid quarterly dividends of 19 billion and special dividends of 41 billion to ge 

  

63 

  

gecc’s liquidity position is targeted to meet its obligations under both normal and stressed conditions gecc establishes a funding plan annually that is based on the projected asset size and cash needs of the company which over the past few years has included our strategy to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital gecc relies on a diversified source of funding including the unsecured term debt markets the global commercial paper markets deposits secured funding retail funding products bank borrowings and securitizations to fund its balance sheet in addition to cash generated through collection of principal interest and other payments on our existing portfolio of loans and leases to fund its operating and interest expense costs 

our 2014 gecc funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding shortterm borrowings including the current portion of longterm debt 392 billion at december 31 2013 through issuance of longterm debt and reissuance of commercial paper cash on hand collections of financing receivables exceeding originations dispositions asset sales and deposits and other alternative sources of funding longterm maturities and early redemptions were 483 billion in 2013 interest on borrowings is primarily repaid through interest earned on existing financing receivables during 2013 gecc earned interest income on financing receivables of 196 billion which more than offset interest expense of 93 billion 

during the first quarter of 2013 50 billion of longterm debt issued by ge matured 

we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for gecc that includes a requirement to maintain a contingency funding plan the liquidity policy defines gecc’s liquidity risk tolerance under different stress scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues we actively monitor gecc’s access to funding markets and its liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise 

gecc is a regulated savings and loan holding company under us law and became subject to federal reserve board frb supervision on july 21 2011 the oneyear anniversary of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act dfa in addition on july 8 2013 the us financial stability oversight council fsoc designated gecc as a nonbank systemically important financial institution nonbank sifi under the dfa many of the rulemakings for supervision of nonbank sifis are not final and therefore the exact impact and implementation date remain uncertain gecc continues to plan for the enhanced prudential standards that will apply to nonbank sifis these dfa rulemakings will require among other items enhanced capital and liquidity levels compliance with the comprehensive capital analysis and review regulations ccar compliance with counterparty credit exposure limits and the development of a resolution plan for submission to regulators 

ge is also subject to the volcker rule which us regulators finalized on december 10 2013 the rule prohibits companies that are affiliated with us insured depository institutions from engaging in “proprietary trading” or acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in or sponsoring or engaging in certain transactions with a “hedge fund” or a “private equity fund” proprietary trading and fund investing as prohibited by the rule are not core activities for ge but ge is assessing the full impact of the rule in anticipation of full conformance with the rule as required by july 21 2015 

the frb recently finalized regulations to revise and replace its current rules on capital adequacy and to extend capital regulations to savings and loan holding companies like gecc under the final rules gecc expects that the standardized approach for calculating capital will apply to gecc in its capacity as a savings and loan holding company on january 1 2015 however that timing could change once nonbank sifi rules are finalized gecc will ultimately also become subject to the basel iii advanced capital rules that will be applicable to institutions with 250 billion or more in assets initial actions required for compliance with the advanced capital rules including building out the necessary systems and models will begin once gecc is subject to regulatory capital rules however full implementation will take several years to complete 

  

64 

  

the frb has also indicated in a proposed rulemaking that they will require nonbank sifis to submit annual capital plans for review including institutions’ plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments the applicability and timing of this proposed regulation to gecc is not yet determined while gecc is not yet subject to this regulation gecc’s capital allocation planning remains subject to frb review as a savings and loan holding company 

overall ge does not believe that gecc’s designation as a nonbank sifi will have a material impact on its business or operations 

liquidity sources 

 

we maintain liquidity sources that consist of cash and equivalents committed unused credit lines and highquality liquid investments 

we had consolidated cash and equivalents of 886 billion at december 31 2013 that were available to meet our needs of this 137 billion was held at ge and 749 billion was held at gecc 

we had committed unused credit lines totaling 478 billion that were extended to us by 50 financial institutions at december 31 2013 gecc can borrow up to 478 billion under all of these credit lines ge can borrow up to 139 billion under certain of these credit lines these lines include 265 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 213 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for two years from the date on which such borrowings would otherwise be due 

cash and equivalents of 570 billion at december 31 2013 were held by nonus subsidiaries of this amount at december 31 2013 81 billion was indefinitely reinvested indefinitely reinvested cash held outside of the us is available to fund operations and other growth of nonus subsidiaries it is also available to fund our needs in the us on a shortterm basis through shortterm loans without being subject to us tax under the internal revenue code these loans are permitted to be outstanding for 30 days or less and the total of all such loans is required to be outstanding for less than 60 days during the year 

at december 31 2013 22 billion of ge cash and equivalents was held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the us or limit our ability to transfer funds to the us without incurring substantial costs these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the us 

at december 31 2013 gecc cash and equivalents of about 12 billion were in regulated banks and insurance entities and were subject to regulatory restrictions 

if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested cash held outside the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 

 

funding plan 

 

we reduced our ge capital ending net investment excluding cash and equivalents to 380 billion at december 31 2013 

during 2013 gecc completed issuances of 337 billion of senior unsecured debt excluding securitizations described below with maturities up to 40 years and subsequent to december 31 2013 an additional 39 billion average commercial paper borrowings for gecc and ge during the fourth quarter were 316 billion and 68 billion respectively and the maximum amounts of commercial paper borrowings outstanding for gecc and ge during the fourth quarter were 331 billion and 90 billion respectively gecc commercial paper maturities are funded principally through new commercial paper issuances and at ge are substantially repaid before quarterend using indefinitely reinvested overseas cash which as discussed above is available for use in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax 

 

  

65 

  

we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding during 2013 we completed 89 billion of nonrecourse issuances and had maturities of 89 billion at december 31 2013 consolidated nonrecourse borrowings were 301 billion 

we have 10 deposittaking banks outside of the us and two deposittaking banks in the us – ge capital retail bank a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital bank formerly ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit cds in maturity terms up to 10 years on january 11 2013 the fsb acquired the deposit business of metlife bank na this acquisition added approximately 64 billion in deposits and an online banking platform 

total alternative funding at december 31 2013 was 108 billion composed mainly of 53 billion of bank deposits 30 billion of nonrecourse securitization borrowings 9 billion of funding secured by real estate aircraft and other collateral and 9 billion of ge interest plus notes the comparable amount at december 31 2012 was 101 billion 

as a matter of general practice we routinely evaluate the economic impact of calling debt instruments where gecc has the right to exercise a call in determining whether to call debt we consider the economic benefit to gecc of calling debt the effect of calling debt on gecc’s liquidity profile and other factors in 2013 we settled 84 billion of callable debt of which 41 billion was called in 2012 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used described further below and should not be viewed as a forecast actual effects would depend on many variables including market factors and the composition of the company’s assets and liabilities at that time

debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

credit ratings 

 

on april 3 2012 moody’s investors service moody’s announced that it had downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of ge by one notch from aa2 to aa3 and the senior unsecured debt rating of gecc by two notches from aa2 to a1 the ratings downgrade did not affect ge’s and gecc’s shortterm funding ratings of p1 which were affirmed by moody’s moody’s ratings outlook for ge and gecc is stable we did not experience any material operational funding or liquidity impacts from this ratings downgrade as of december 31 2013 ge’s and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt ratings from standard and poor’s ratings service sp were aa with a stable outlook and their shortterm funding ratings from sp were a1 we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

substantially all gics were affected by the downgrade and are more fully discussed in the principal debt and derivative conditions section in this item 

principal debt and derivative conditions 

 

certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings 

fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on among other factors market movements and changes in our positions we manage counterparty credit risk the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements on an individual counterparty basis where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response including requiring additional collateral 

swap forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the longterm credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below aa3 in certain of these master agreements the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the shortterm ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a1p1 the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be 12 billion at december 31 2013 see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

  

other debt and derivative agreements of consolidated entities include trinity which comprises two entities that hold investment securities the majority of which are investment grade and were funded by the issuance of gics these gics included conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the longterm credit ratings of gecc fall below aaaa3 or the shortterm credit ratings fall below a1p1 and are reported in investment contracts insurance liabilities and insurance annuity benefits the trinity assets and liabilities are disclosed in note a on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report another consolidated entity also had issued gics where proceeds are loaned to gecc these gics included conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the longterm credit ratings of gecc fall below aaaa3 these obligations are included in longterm borrowings on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report these three consolidated entities ceased issuing gics in 2010

following the april 3 2012 moody’s downgrade of gecc’s longterm credit rating to a1 substantially all of these gics became redeemable by their holders in 2012 holders of 24 billion in principal amount of gics redeemed their holdings and gecc made related cash payments the remaining outstanding gics will continue to be subject to their scheduled maturities and individual terms which may include provisions permitting redemption upon a downgrade of one or more of gecc’s ratings among other things 

  

ratio of earnings to fixed charges income maintenance agreement and subordinated debentures 

 

ge provides implicit and explicit support to gecc through commitments capital contributions and operating support for example and as discussed below ge has committed to keep gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges above a minimum level gecc’s credit rating is higher than it would be on a standalone basis as a result of this financial support gecc currently does not pay ge for this support 

on march 28 1991 ge entered into an agreement with gecc to make payments to gecc constituting additions to pretax income under the agreement which increases equity to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc and consolidated affiliates determined on a consolidated basis to be not less than 1101 for the period as a single aggregation of each gecc fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991 gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1761 for 2013 no payment is required in 2013 pursuant to this agreement 

in addition in connection with certain subordinated debentures of gecc that may be classified as equity hybrid debt during events of default or interest deferral periods under such subordinated debentures gecc has agreed not to declare or pay any dividends or distributions or make certain other payments with respect to its capital stock and ge has agreed to promptly return any payments made to ge in violation of this agreement there were 77 billion of such debentures outstanding at december 31 2013 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

statements of changes in shareowners’ equity and comprehensive income 

 

an analysis of changes in the elements of shareowners’ equity as presented in the statements of changes in shareowners’ equity and comprehensive income follows 

ge shareowners’ equity increased by 75 billion in 2013 compared with an increase of 66 billion in 2012 and a decrease of 25 billion in 2011 

net earnings increased ge shareowners equity by 131 billion 136 billion and 142 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 81 billion 74 billion and 75 billion including 08 billion related to our preferred stock redemption in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

elements of aoci increased shareowners’ equity by 111 billion in 2013 compared with an increase of 37 billion in 2012 and a decrease of 61 billion in 2011 the components of these changes are as follows 

 

 

 

  

68 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncontrolling interests included in shareowners’ equity increased 08 billion and 37 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively principally as a result of the issuances of preferred stock by gecc noncontrolling interests decreased by 36 billion in 2011 principally as a result of dispositions 

 

 

statement of cash flows – overview from 2011 through 2013 

 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 886 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 113 billion from december 31 2012 cash and equivalents totaled 773 billion at december 31 2012 a decrease of 72 billion from december 31 2011 

 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets and deposits as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

  

ge cash flows 

  

ge cash and equivalents were 137 billion at december 31 2013 compared with 155 billion at december 31 2012 ge cfoa totaled 143 billion 178 billion and 121 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively with respect to ge cfoa we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

 

  

69 

  

 

 

 

 

the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales ge operating cash collections decreased by 06 billion in 2013 compared with an increase of 118 billion in 2012 in 2013 these changes are consistent with a decrease in collections on longterm contracts and increases in current receivables partially offset by increased progress collections and improved segment revenues including the impact of acquisitions primarily at aviation and oil  gas in 2012 these changes are consistent with the changes in comparable ge segment revenues including the impact of acquisitions primarily at oil  gas and energy management analyses of segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section provide additional information regarding our cfoa 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services ge operating cash payments increased by 25 billion and 125 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2013 these changes are consistent with nbcu dealrelated tax payments and payouts under our longterm incentive plan partially offset by the nonrecurrence of principal pension plan funding in 2012 these changes are consistent with the changes in ge total costs and expenses including the impact of acquisitions primarily at oil  gas and energy management 

dividends from gecc including special dividends represent the distribution of a portion of gecc retained earnings and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses the amounts we show in ge cfoa are the total dividends including special dividends from excess capital beginning in the second quarter of 2012 gecc restarted its dividend to ge gecc paid quarterly dividends of 19 billion in both 2013 and 2012 in addition gecc paid special dividends of 41 billion and 45 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively to ge there were no dividends received from gecc in 2011 

ge cash from investing activities was 48 billion for 2013 compared with cash used of 54 billion and 82 billion for 2012 and 2011 respectively ge cash flows from investing activities increased 102 billion during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to proceeds of 167 billion from the 2013 sale of our remaining 49 common equity interest in nbcu llc to comcast partially offset by the 2013 acquisitions of avio for 44 billion and lufkin for 33 billion 

 

ge cash used for investing activities decreased by 28 billion during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to decreased business acquisition activity of 97 billion driven by 2011 acquisitions of converteam the well support division of john wood group plc dresser inc wellstream plc and lineage power holdings inc this was offset by decreased business disposition activity of 57 billion driven by cash received in 2011 related to the formation of nbcu llc 62 billion and an increase in additions to property plant and equipment of 10 billion in 2012 

ge cash used for financing activities was 209 billion 53 billion and 146 billion for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively cash used for financing activities increased 156 billion compared with 2012 primarily as a result of our 2013 repayment of 50 billion of ge unsecured notes compared with an issuance of 70 billion of notes in 2012 additionally increases in cash used in 2013 were a result of increased repurchases of ge shares for treasury in accordance with our share repurchase program of 52 billion and increased dividends paid to shareowners of 06 billion in 2013 

 

  

70 

  

ge cash used for financing activities decreased 93 billion compared with 2011 primarily due to an issuance of 70 billion of notes in 2012 and nonrecurrence of two transactions from 2011 in 2011 prior to the formation of nbcu llc ge purchased the remaining shares of vivendi sa’s 123 interest in nbc universal for 39 billion additionally ge redeemed preferred shares from berkshire hathaway inc at a redemption price of 33 billion the impacts of these 2011 transactions were offset by increased repurchases of ge shares for treasury in accordance with our share repurchase program of 29 billion and increased dividends paid to shareowners of 07 billion in 2012 

gecc cash flows 

 

gecc cash from operating activities totaled 199 billion 217 billion and 206 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively cash from operating activities decreased 19 billion during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to decreases in net cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 52 billion partially offset by increases in other liabilities of 18 billion and accounts payable of 10 billion 

cash from operating activities increased 11 billion during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to increases in net cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 17 billion partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of 09 billion 

consistent with our plan to reduce gecc asset levels cash from investing activities was 234 billion 147 billion and 298 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively gecc cash from investing activities increased 87 billion during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher proceeds from sales of real estate properties of 73 billion the acquisition of metlife bank na in 2013 resulting in net cash provided from the acquisition of 64 billion lower net purchases of elto of 16 billion partially offset by lower net loan repayments from our equity method investments of 49 billion and lower collections which includes sales exceeding originations of financing receivables of 19 billion 

gecc cash from investing activities decreased 151 billion during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower collections which includes sales exceeding originations of financing receivables of 90 billion lower proceeds from sales of discontinued operations of 87 billion and higher net purchases of elto of 17 billion these decreases were partially offset by higher net dispositions and maturities of investment securities of 26 billion and a decrease in all other assets–investments of 17 billion driven by net activity of our equity method investments 

gecc cash used for financing activities was 294 billion 525 billion and 332 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively gecc cash used for financing activities decreased 230 billion during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower net repayments of borrowings of 240 billion consisting primarily of net reductions in longterm borrowings and commercial paper and lower redemptions of guaranteed investment contracts of 23 billion partially offset by lower proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of 30 billion 

  

gecc cash used for financing activities increased 193 billion during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to a reduction in total borrowings of 117 billion consisting primarily of net reductions in longterm borrowings and commercial paper 65 billion of dividends paid to shareowners in 2012 including 01 billion paid to preferred shareowners a reduction in bank deposits of 42 billion and 10 billion of redemptions of guaranteed investment contracts at trinity partially offset by 40 billion of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock   

gecc pays dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales beginning in the second quarter of 2012 gecc restarted its dividend to ge during 2013 and 2012 gecc paid quarterly dividends of 19 billion in both years and special dividends of 41 billion and 45 billion respectively to ge no dividends were paid to ge in 2011

intercompany eliminations 

 

effects of transactions between related companies are made on an armslength basis are eliminated and consist primarily of gecc dividends to ge ge customer receivables sold to gecc gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecc information technology it and other services sold to gecc by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs for further information related to intercompany eliminations see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2013 follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

variable interest entities 

 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions 

the assets we currently securitize include receivables secured by equipment credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business the securitizations are funded with variable funding notes and term debt 

substantially all of our securitization vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement 

 

  

72 

  

at december 31 2013 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 493 billion and 325 billion respectively an increase of 09 billion and a decrease of 04 billion from 2012 assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our other assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

at december 31 2013 investments in unconsolidated vies were 125 billion a decrease of 02 billion from 2012 primarily related to a decrease of 20 billion in ptl partially offset by an increase of 19 billion in an investment in assetbacked securities issued by a senior secured loan fund in the first quarter of 2013 ptl had repaid all outstanding debt owed and terminated its borrowing arrangement with gecc during the second quarter of 2013 ptl ceased to be a vie as a result of a principal in ptl retiring from the ge board therefore our investment in ptl 899 million at december 31 2013 is not reported in the december 31 2013 balance in addition to our existing investments we have contractual obligations to fund additional investments in the unconsolidated vies to fund new asset origination at december 31 2013 these contractual obligations were 28 billion an increase of 01 billion from 2012 

we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred financing receivables to any vie in either 2013 or 2012 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates writeoffs in both our consumer and commercial portfolios can also reflect both losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of a fiscal year and information becoming available during that fiscal year that may identify further deterioration on exposures existing prior to the beginning of that fiscal year and for which reserves could not have been previously recognized our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments increased earnings by 03 billion 04 billion and 04 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use quoted market prices when available our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals as appropriate

our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in ge capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on managements best estimate in determining its best estimate management evaluates average current market values obtained from third parties of similar type and age aircraft which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 07 billion and 02 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively impairment losses in 2013 incorporated management’s downward revisions to cash flow estimates based upon shorter useful lives and lower aircraft residual values from those indicated by our thirdparty appraisers reflecting the introduction of newer technology fleet retirements and high fuel prices and operating costs these revised estimates primarily related to cargo aircraft 03 billion older technology narrowbody aircraft 02 billion and regional jets 01 billion the average age of aircrafts we impaired in 2013 was 15 years compared with 7 years for our total fleet provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were an insignificant amount for both 2013 and 2012 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview of our earnings from 2011 through 2013 and the financial resources and liquidity – property plant and equipment sections of this item and in notes 7 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments annually or more frequently as conditions warrant the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values based on the most recent valuation estimates available the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 21 billion this amount is subject to variation dependent on the assumptions described above changes in economic and market conditions and composition of our portfolio including sales commercial real estate valuations have shown signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets primarily in the us however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market accordingly there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon cash flow estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about capitalization rates and expected trends in rents and occupancy and is corroborated by external appraisals during 2013 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 03 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 01 billion in 2012 deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets result in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management and the all other assets sections of this item and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year using data as of july 1 of that year the impairment test consists of two steps in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted appropriately 

valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles size geography and diversity of products and services a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 80 to 165 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods   

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for highquality fixedincome securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 485 396 and 421 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and target asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future longterm return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we formulate views on the future economic environment both in the us and abroad we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth inflation valuations yields and spreads using both internal and external sources we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations assets in our principal pension plans earned 146 in 2013 and had average annual returns of 65 59 and 89 per year in the 10 15 and 25year periods ended december 31 2013 respectively these average historical returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008 based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and target asset allocations we have assumed a 75 longterm expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2014 this is a reduction from the 80 we assumed in 2013 2012 and 2011 

changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company at december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 110 billion and 108 billion of earnings respectively have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations because of the availability of us foreign tax credits it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 55 billion and 48 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively including 08 billion at both december 31 2013 and 2012 of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances associated with losses reported in discontinued operations primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan such yearend 2013 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

further information on income taxes is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation as applicable 

at december 31 2013 derivative assets and liabilities were 10 billion and 13 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 9 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report   

fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and longlived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investments and longlived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs

a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates

supplemental information 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this form 10k report to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

80 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

 

we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as industrial cfoa which we define as ge’s cash from continuing operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecc this includes the effects of intercompany transactions including ge customer receivables sold to gecc gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecc information technology it and other services sold to gecc by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge’s operating cash flows without the effect of gecc dividends since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from periodtoperiod based upon the results of the financial services businesses we also believe that investors may find it useful to compare industrial cfoa excluding the effects of taxes paid related to the nbcu transaction management recognizes that these measures may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies that contain both industrial and financial services businesses but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services gecc cash flows we believe that our measures of industrial cfoa and cfoa excluding nbcu dealrelated taxes provide management and investors with useful measures to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flows with the operating cash flows of other nonfinancial businesses and companies and as such provide useful measures to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure

operating earnings excludes nonservicerelated pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gainslosses the service cost and prior service cost components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees as such we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan we also believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies we believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company we also believe that operating eps excluding the effects of the 08 billion preferred dividend related to the redemption of our preferred stock calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock is a meaningful measure because it increases the comparability of periodtoperiod results 

 

  

82 

  

 

 

we have provided the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans operating pension costs comprise the service cost of benefits earned and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans nonoperating pension costs comprise the expected return on plan assets interest cost on benefit obligations and net actuarial loss amortization for our principal pension plans we believe that the operating components of pension costs better reflect the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees we believe that the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our pension plan costs and operating results with the pension plan costs and operating results of other companies 

 

 

a used for computing return on average ge shareowners’ equity and return on average total capital invested rotc 

 

 

 

our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings our calculation of average ge shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary 

 

  

83 

  

 

we have provided the gecc ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents as a reduction of debt and longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity for purposes of this ratio we have also adjusted cash and debt balances to include amounts classified as assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale and discontinued operations we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace certain longterm debt with equity despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses 

 

 

we use eni to measure the size of our ge capital segment we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital debt or equity required to fund a business as it adjusts for noninterestbearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay we also believe that by excluding cash and equivalents we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our ge capital segment as a substantial amount of this cash and equivalents resulted from debt issuances to prefund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment 

  

84 

  

 

 

 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecc net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecc earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecc tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses

aviation is party to agreements in which the financial results as well as production responsibilities of certain aircraft and marine engine lines are shared these agreements take the form of both joint ventures and revenue sharing programs

the worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and mro including parts sales is intense both us and export markets are important product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success research and development expenditures are important in this business as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design manufacture repair and product upgrade technologies our products and services are subject to a number of regulatory standards 

potential sales for any engine are limited by among other things its technological lifetime which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology the relatively small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles although these cycles differ from each other

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 “business” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

  

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section and in the business descriptions in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report below we describe certain important operational and strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

our growth is subject to global economic and political risks 

we operate in virtually every part of the world and serve customers in more than 100 countries in 2012 approximately 52 of our revenue was attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition and geopolitical risks they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these global economic and political risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation may decrease or become even more costly as a result of more volatile market conditions 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular us and nonus governments are undertaking a substantial revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and non

bank financial institutions consumer lending the overthecounter derivatives market and tax laws and regulations which changes may have an effect on ge’s and ge capital’s structure operations liquidity capital requirements effective tax rate and performance for example under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act ge capital is subject to prudential oversight by the federal reserve which subjects us to increased and evolving regulatory requirements we are also subject to a number of trade control laws and regulations that may affect our ability to sell our products in global markets in addition we are subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local capital requirements that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with nonus financial institutions in global markets this provision which had expired at the end of 2011 was reinstated in january 2013 retroactively for two years through the end of 2013 this provision also had been scheduled to expire and had been extended by congress on six previous occasions but there can be no assurance that it will continue to be extended in the event the provision is not extended after 2013 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2014 in addition efforts by public and private sectors to control the growth of healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers continued government scrutiny including reviews of the us food and drug administration us fda medical device premarket authorization and postmarket surveillance processes may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in us and international governmental programs which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators and other governmental authorities which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time 

  

the success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions joint ventures dispositions and restructurings 

with respect to acquisitions joint ventures and restructuring actions we may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology in addition we may not achieve anticipated cost savings from restructuring actions which could result in lower margin rates we also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world including joint ventures where we may have a lesser degree of control over the business operations which may expose us to additional operational financial legal or compliance risks we also continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic

objectives alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could affect our future financial results 

  

sustained increases in costs of pension and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we use to estimate pension expense for 2013 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated gains losses – net benefit plans at the end of 2012 the ge pension plan was underfunded on a us gaap basis by 133 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 55 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees may increase future funding obligations although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability 

conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of funding 

as disclosed in more detail in the liquidity and borrowings section in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report a large portion of our borrowings is in the form of commercial paper and longterm debt we continue to rely on the availability of the unsecured debt markets to access funding for term and commercial paper maturities for 2013 and beyond and to fund our operations without incurring additional us tax in addition we rely on the availability of the commercial paper markets to refinance maturing commercial paper debt throughout the year in order to further diversify our funding sources ge capital continues to expand its reliance on alternative sources of funding including bank deposits securitizations and other assetbased funding there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing the diversification of our funding sources or that the short and longterm credit markets will be available or if available that the cost of funding will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability factors that may affect the availability of funding or cause an increase in our funding costs include a decreased reliance on shortterm funding such as commercial paper in favor of longerterm funding arrangements decreased capacity and increased competition among debt issuers increased competition for deposits in our affiliate banks’ markets and potential market disruptions or other impacts arising in the united states or europe from developments in sovereign debt situations if ge capital’s cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect its competitive position and result in lower net interest margins earnings and cash flows as well as lower returns on its shareowner’s equity and invested capital 

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate they may adversely affect the business and results of operations of ge capital as well as the soundness of financial institutions and governments we deal with 

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets including goodwill intangibles and tax assets in addition deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase allowances for loan losses impairments or writeoffs which 

  

  

16 

  

  

depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

in addition ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties including sovereign governments and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the value of collateral held cannot be realized through sale or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of cash on deposit and unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which are designed to limit credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

  

the real estate markets in which ge capital participates are highly dependent on economic conditions the deterioration of which may adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

ge capital participates in the commercial real estate market in two ways it provides financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties and in a limited number of markets it also acquires equity positions in various types of properties or real estate investments the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the economic conditions in specific geographic markets in which the properties are located and the perceived value of those markets at the time of sale the level of transactions for real estate assets continues to remain below historical norms in several markets in which ge capital operates high levels of unemployment slowdown in business activity excess inventory capacity and limited availability of credit may continue to adversely affect the value of real estate assets and collateral to real estate loans ge capital holds under current market and credit conditions there can be no assurance as to the level of sales ge capital will complete or the net sales proceeds it will realize also occupancy rates and market rent levels may worsen which may result in impairments to the carrying value of equity investments or increases in the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans 

  

ge capital is also a residential mortgage lender in certain geographic markets outside the united states that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declines in real estate values and home sale volumes job losses government austerity measures and mandated programs consumer bankruptcies and other factors that may negatively impact the credit performance of our mortgage loans our allowance for loan losses on these mortgage loans is based on our analysis of current and historical delinquency property values and loan performance as well as other management assumptions that may be inaccurate predictors of credit performance in this environment there can be no assurance that in this environment credit performance will not be materially worse than anticipated and as a result materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting as of december 31 2012 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was aa the second highest of 22 rating categories with a stable outlook the longterm unsecured debt credit rating from moody’s investors service moody’s for ge was aa3 the fourth highest of 21 rating categories and for gecc was a1 the fifth highest of 21 credit ratings both with stable outlooks as of december 31 2012 ge and gecc’s shortterm credit rating from sp was a1 the highest rating category of six categories and from moody’s was p1 the highest rating category of four categories there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt and derivative instruments guarantees and 

  

  

17 

  

  

covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade which depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position 

current conditions in the global economy and the major industries we serve also may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our nonfinancial businesses 

the business and operating results of our industrial businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions including conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare home building and other major industries we serve as a result of slower global economic growth the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence continued high unemployment levels reduced levels of capital expenditures fluctuating commodity prices bankruptcies government deficit reduction and austerity measures including sequestrations and other challenges affecting the global economy some of our government and nongovernment customers have experienced deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion in particular the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and international economies an extended period of slow growth in the us or internationally that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers and the viability of their business service contract cancellations or customer dynamics such as early aircraft retirements could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if slower growth in the global economy continues for a significant period or there is additional significant deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

increased it security requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions services and data 

increased global it security vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted itrelated attacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers’ and suppliers’ systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we may face operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations and we are dependent on maintenance of existing product lines market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our and thirdparty products that incorporate or use leadingedge technology including both hardware and software while we have built extensive operational processes to ensure that the design manufacture and servicing of such products meet the most rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process failures or other problems including through intentional acts that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks such operational failures or quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations in addition the markets in which we operate are subject to technological change and require skilled talent our longterm operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative products to modify existing products to customize products to respond to technological change and to execute our product development in line with our projected cost estimates

our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours 

our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we could also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio we also face attempts by thirdparties to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming if ge is found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms 

significant raw material shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials parts components systems and services some of these suppliers or their subsuppliers are limited or solesource suppliers a disruption in deliveries from our thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers or service providers capacity constraints production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities including as a result of catastrophic events could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs quality and sourcing issues experienced by thirdparty providers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm

ge sales of product services were 434 billion in 2012 an increase of 4 compared with 2011 and operating profit from product services was 125 billion in 2012 an increase of 6 compared with 2011 both the sales and operating profit of product services increases were at power  water oil  gas transportation and energy management ge sales of product services were 419 billion in 2011 an increase of 14 compared with 2010 and operating profit from product services was 118 billion in 2011 an increase of 15 compared with 2010 both the sales and operating profit of product services increases were at oil  gas energy management aviation transportation and healthcare 

postretirement benefit plans costs were 55 billion 41 billion and 30 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively costs increased in 2012 primarily due to the continued amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 528 at december 31 2010 to 421 at december 31 2011 costs increased in 2011 primarily due to the continued amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 578 at december 31 2009 to 528 at december 31 2010 

our discount rate for our principal pension plans at december 31 2012 was 396 which reflected current historically low interest rates considering the current and target asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 80 for cost recognition in 2013 compared to 80 in both 2012 and 2011 and 85 in 2010 gaap provides for recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees see the critical accounting estimates section for additional information 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits to increase in 2013 by approximately 04 billion as compared to 2012 primarily because of the effects of additional 2008 investment loss amortization and lower discount rates based on our current assumptions we expect that loss amortization related to our principal pension plans will peak in 2013 and as a result our postretirement benefits costs should decline in 2014 

pension expense for our principal pension plans on a gaap basis was 38 billion 24 billion and 11 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively operating pension costs nongaap for these plans were 17 billion in 2012 and 14 billion in both 2011 and 2010 operating earnings include service cost and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee service operating earnings exclude nonoperating pension costsincome such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses operating pension costs increased in 2012 primarily due to the effects of lower discount rates and additional prior service cost amortization resulting from 2011 union negotiations we expect operating pension costs for these plans will be about 17 billion in 2013 

the ge pension plan was underfunded by 133 billion at the end of 2012 as compared to 132 billion at december 31 2011 the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligations of 55 billion and 52 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our underfunding at yearend 2012 was relatively consistent with 2011 as the effects of lower discount rates and liability growth were primarily offset by higher investment returns 117 return in 2012 our principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 421 at december 31 2011 to 396 at december 31 2012 which increased the pension benefit obligation at yearend 2012 by approximately 20 billion a 100 basis point increase in our pension discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation at yearend by approximately 74 billion our ge pension plan assets increased from 421 billion at the end of 2011 to 447 billion at december 31 2012 primarily driven by higher investment returns that were partially offset by benefit payments made during the year assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations

on july 6 2012 the us government enacted the “moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act” which contained provisions that changed the interest rate methodology used to calculate employee retirement income security act erisa minimum pension funding requirements in the us this change reduced our nearterm annual cash funding requirements for the ge pension plan we contributed 04 billion to the ge pension plan in 2012 we are not required to contribute to the ge pension plan in 2013 

on an erisa basis our preliminary estimate is that the ge pension plan was approximately 100 funded at january 1 2013 based on this our current best estimate of the projected 2014 ge pension plan required contribution is approximately 06 billion 

at december 31 2012 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 39 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2011 was 33 billion this increase was primarily attributable to lower discount rates we expect to contribute 07 billion to our other pension plans in 2013 the same as in both 2012 and 2011 

 

the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was 109 billion and 121 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively this decrease was primarily attributable to a plan amendment that affected retiree health and life benefit eligibility for certain salaried plan participants and lower cost trends which were partially offset by the effects of lower discount rates retiree health and life plans discount rate decreased from 409 at december 31 2011 to 374 at december 31 2012 we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis we expect to contribute 06 billion to these plans in 2013 compared with actual contributions of 05 billion and 06 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses these costs were 175 185 and 163 of total ge sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2012 decrease was primarily driven by increased sales and the effects of global cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increased acquisitionrelated costs the vast majority of the 2011 increase was driven by higher pension costs and increased costs to support global growth 

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 125 billion 145 billion and 155 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 117 billion 139 billion and 145 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively gecc average borrowings declined from 2011 to 2012 and from 2010 to 2011 in line with changes in average gecc assets interest rates have decreased over the threeyear period primarily attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates gecc average borrowings were 4219 billion 4527 billion and 4720 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the gecc average composite effective interest rate was 28 in 2012 31 in 2011 and 31 in 2010 in 2012 gecc average assets of 5621 billion were 5 lower than in 2011 which in turn were 3 lower than in 2010 see the liquidity and borrowings section for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax rates are also affected by tax incentives introduced in the us and other countries to encourage and support certain types of activity our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

ge and gecc file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecc tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge

income taxes on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 144 in 2012 compared with 283 in 2011 and 73 in 2010 

our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because ge funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes in us or foreign law including the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

our benefits from lowertaxed global operations increased to 22 billion in 2012 from 21 billion in 2011 principally because of the realization of benefits for prior year losses and a decrease in current year losses for which there was not a full tax benefit our benefits from lowertaxed global operations declined to 21 billion in 2011 from 28 billion in 2010 principally because of lower earnings indefinitely reinvested in our operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and a decrease in the benefit from audit resolutions the benefit from lowertaxed global operations include in 2012 and in 2011 01 billion and in 2010 04 billion due to audit resolutions to the extent global interest rates and nonus operating income increase we would expect tax benefits to increase subject to management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings 

our benefit from lower taxed global operations included the effect of the lower foreign tax rate on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which provided a tax benefit of 13 billion in 2012 15 billion in 2011 and 20 billion in 2010 the tax benefit from nonus income taxed at a local country rather than the us statutory tax rate is reported in the effective tax rate reconciliation in the line “tax on global earnings including exports” 

the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 was due in significant part to the high effective tax rate in 2011 on the pretax gain on the nbc universal nbcu transaction with comcast corporation comcast discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplemental data” of this form 10k report this gain increased the 2011 consolidated effective tax rate by 128 percentage points the effective tax rate was also lower due to the benefit of the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business properties disposition 

cash income taxes paid in 2012 were 32 billion reflecting the effects of changes to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and the timing of tax payments to governments 

the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011 was due in significant part to the high effective tax rate on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast discussed above and in note 2 the effective tax rate was also higher because of the increase in 2011 of income in higher taxed jurisdictions this decreased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations in addition the consolidated income tax rate increased from 2010 to 2011 due to the decrease discussed above in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations and the lower benefit from audit resolutions

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted and the law extended several provisions including a two year extension of the us tax provision deferring tax on active financial services income retroactive to january 1 2012 under accounting rules a tax law change is taken into account in calculating the income tax provision in the period in which enacted because the extension was enacted into law after the end of 2012 tax expense for 2012 does not reflect retroactive extension of expired provisions 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecc and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecc net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecc earnings ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecc earnings from continuing operations were 95 billion 126 billion and 120 billion for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in earnings reflects the nonrepeat of the pretax gain on sale of nbcu and higher loss amortization related to our principal pension plans on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 213 in 2012 383 in 2011 and 168 in 2010 

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2011 to 2012 primarily because of the high effective tax rate in 2011 on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast reflecting the low tax basis in our investments in the nbcu business and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to our 49 investment in nbcuniversal llc nbcu llc see note 2 this gain increased the 2011 ge effective tax rate by 197 percentage points partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the ge effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 due to higher pretax income and to the decrease in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

 

the ge effective tax rate increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily because of the high effective tax rate on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast discussed above and in note 2 in addition the effective tax rate increased because of the decrease in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

 

the gecc effective income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a tax benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because gecc funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and

supplementary data” of this form 10k report in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

as noted above ge and gecc file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecc tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecc effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return ge makes cash payments to gecc for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due the effect of gecc on the amount of the consolidated tax liability from the formation of the nbcu joint venture will be settled in cash no later than when gecc tax deductions and credits otherwise would have reduced the liability of the group absent the tax on joint venture formation 

the gecc effective tax rate was 62 in 2012 compared with 118  in 2011 and 458 in 2010 comparing a tax benefit to pretax income resulted in a negative tax rate in 2010 our tax expense of 05 billion in 2012 decreased by 04 billion from 09 billion in 2011 the lower 2012 tax expense resulted principally from the benefit attributable to the high tax basis in the entity sold in the business property disposition 03 billion increased benefits from low taxed global operations 03 billion and the absence of the 2011 hightaxed disposition of garanti bank 01 billion partially offsetting the decrease in tax expense was the absence in 2012 of the 2011 benefit from resolution of the 20062007 internal revenue service irs audit 02 billion which is reported in the caption “all othernet” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report and from higher pretax income in 2012 than in 2011 which increased pretax income 03 billion and increased the expense 01 billion 

the gecc effective tax rate was 118 in 2011 compared with 458 in 2010 comparing a tax benefit to pretax income resulted in a negative tax rate in 2010 the gecc tax expense of 09 billion in 2011 increased by 19 billion from a 10 billion benefit in 2010 the higher 2011 tax expense resulted principally from higher pretax income in 2011 than in 2010 of 55 billion which increased the tax expense 19 billion also increasing the expense was a benefit from resolution of the 20062007 internal revenue service irs audit 02 billion that was less than the benefit from resolution of the 20032005 irs audit 03 billion both of which are reported in the caption “all othernet” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization like ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated we evaluate risk at the individual transaction level and evaluate aggregated risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

risk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of management the ge board of directors board has oversight for risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company including strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks at the end of each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to prioritize in the next year throughout the year the board and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail strategic operational and reputational risks are presented and discussed in the context of the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings and at presentations to the board and its committees by the vice chairmen chief risk officer cro general counsel and other employees the board has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific risks to board committees as follows 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

the ge board’s risk oversight process builds upon management’s risk assessment and mitigation processes which include standardized reviews of longterm strategic and operational planning executive development and evaluation code of conduct compliance under the company’s the spirit  the letter regulatory compliance health safety and environmental compliance financial reporting and controllership and information technology and security ge’s cro is responsible for overseeing and coordinating risk assessment and mitigation on an enterprisewide basis the cro leads the corporate risk function and is responsible for the identification of key business risks providing for appropriate management of these risks within ge board guidelines and enforcement through policies and procedures management has two committees to further assist it in assessing and mitigating risk the corporate risk committee crc meets at least four times per year is chaired by the cro and comprises the chairman and ceo vice chairmen general counsel and other senior level business and functional leaders it has principal responsibility for evaluating and addressing risks escalated to the cro and corporate risk function the policy compliance review board met 16 times in 2012 is chaired by the company’s general counsel and includes the chief financial officer and other senior level functional leaders it has principal responsibility for monitoring compliance matters across the company 

  

33 

  

  

ges corporate risk function leverages the risk infrastructures in each of our businesses which have adopted an approach that corresponds to the company’s overall risk policies guidelines and review mechanisms our risk infrastructure operates at the business and functional levels and is designed to identify evaluate and mitigate risks within each of the following categories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks identified through our risk management processes are prioritized and depending on the probability and severity of the risk escalated to the cro the cro in coordination with the crc assigns responsibility for the risks to the business or functional leader most suited to manage the risk assigned owners are required to continually monitor evaluate and report on risks for which they bear responsibility enterprise risk leaders within each business and corporate function are responsible to present to the cro and crc risk assessments and key risks at least annually we have general response strategies for managing risks which categorize risks according to whether the company will avoid transfer reduce or accept the risk these response strategies are tailored to ensure that risks are within acceptable ge board general guidelines 

depending on the nature of the risk involved and the particular business or function affected we use a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies including delegation of authorities standardized processes and strategic planning reviews operating reviews insurance and hedging as a matter of policy we generally hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our service businesses employ a comprehensive tollgate process leading up to and through the execution of a contractual service agreement to mitigate legal financial and operational risks furthermore we centrally manage some risks by purchasing insurance the amount of which is determined by balancing the level of risk retained or assumed with the cost of transferring risk to others we manage the risk of fluctuations in economic activity and customer demand by monitoring industry dynamics and responding accordingly including by adjusting capacity implementing cost reductions and engaging in mergers acquisitions and dispositions 

ge capital risk management and oversight 

 

ge capital acknowledges risktaking as a fundamental characteristic of providing financial services it is inherent to its business and arises in lending leasing and investment transactions undertaken by ge capital ge capital operates within the parameters of its established risk appetite in pursuit of its strategic goals and objectives 

  

34 

  

  

ge capital has robust risk infrastructure and processes to manage risks related to its businesses and the ge corporate risk function relies upon them in fulfilling its mission 

the ge risk committee was established to oversee ge capital’s risk appetite risk assessment and management processes the gecc board oversees the ge capital risk management framework and approves all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as significant borrowings and investments the gecc board exercises oversight of investment activities in the business units through delegations of authority all participants in the ge capital risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the gecc board 

the enterprise risk management committee ermc which comprises the most senior leaders in ge capital as well as the ge cro oversees the implementation of ge capital’s risk appetite and senior management’s establishment of appropriate systems including policies procedures and management committees to ensure enterprise risks are effectively identified measured monitored and controlled daytoday risk oversight for ge capital is provided by an independent global risk management organization that includes the ge capital corporate function in addition to independent risk officers embedded in the individual business units 

ge capital’s risk management approach rests upon three major tenets a broad spread of risk based on managed exposure limits senior secured commercial financings and a holdtomaturity model with transactions underwritten to “onbook” standards dedicated risk professionals across the businesses include underwriters portfolio managers collectors environmental or engineering specialists and specialized asset managers the senior risk officers have on average over 25 years of experience 

ge capital manages all risks relevant to its business environment which if materialized could prevent ge capital from achieving its risk objectives andor result in losses these risks are defined as ge capital’s enterprise risk universe which includes the following risks strategic liquidity credit and investment market and operational including financial compliance information technology human resources and legal reputational risk is considered and managed across each of the categories ge capital continues to make significant investments in resources to enhance its evolving risk management infrastructure 

ge capital’s corporate risk function in consultation with the ermc updates the enterprise risk appetite statement annually this document articulates the enterprise risk objectives its key universe of risks and the supporting limit structure ge capital’s risk appetite is determined relative to its desired risk objectives including but not limited to credit ratings capital levels liquidity management regulatory assessments earnings dividends and compliance ge capital determines its risk appetite through consideration of portfolio analytics including stress testing and economic capital measurement experience and judgment of senior risk officers current portfolio levels strategic planning and regulatory and rating agency expectations 

the enterprise risk appetite is presented to the gecc board and the ge risk committee for review and approval at least annually on a quarterly basis the status of ge capital’s performance against these limits is reviewed by the ge risk committee 

  

35 

  

  

ge capital monitors its capital adequacy including through economic capital regulatory capital and enterprise stress testing methodologies ge capital’s economic capital methodology uses internal models to estimate potential unexpected losses across different portfolios with a confidence interval equivalent to an aa agency rating although ge capital is not currently subject to riskbased capital standards ge capital estimates capital adequacy based on both the basel 1 us and basel 3 international frameworks ge capital uses stress testing for risk liquidity and capital adequacy assessment and management purposes and as an integral part of ge capital’s overall planning processes stress testing results inform key strategic portfolio decisions such as capital allocation assist in developing the risk appetite and limits and help in assessing product specific risk to guide the development and modification of product structures the ge risk committee and the gecc board review stress test results and their expected impact on capital levels and metrics the ge risk committee and the gecc board are responsible for overseeing the overall capital adequacy process as well as approving ge capital’s annual capital plan and capital actions operational risks are inherent in ge capital’s business activities and are typical of any large enterprise ge capital’s operational risk management program seeks to effectively manage operational risk to reduce the potential for significant unexpected losses and to minimize the impact of losses experienced in the normal course of business 

key risk management policies are approved by the gecc board and the ge risk committee at least annually ge capital in coordination with the ge cro meets with the ge risk committee at least four times a year at these meetings ge capital senior management focuses on the risk issues strategy and governance of the business

segment operations 

 

on february 22 2012 we merged our whollyowned subsidiary gecs with and into gecs’ whollyowned subsidiary gecc our financial services segment ge capital continues to comprise the continuing operations of gecc which now include the runoff insurance operations previously held and managed in gecs unless otherwise indicated references to gecc and the ge capital segment in this form 10k report relate to the entity or segment as they exist subsequent to the february 22 2012 merger 

effective october 1 2012 we reorganized the former energy infrastructure segment into three segments – power  water oil  gas and energy management and we began reporting these as separate segments beginning with this form 10k report we also reorganized our home  business solutions segment by transferring our intelligent platforms business to energy management results for 2012 and prior periods in this form 10k report are reported on this basis 

results of our formerly consolidated subsidiary nbcu and our current equity method investment in nbcu llc are reported in the corporate items and eliminations line on the summary of operating segments 

our eight segments are focused on the broad markets they serve power  water oil  gas energy management aviation healthcare transportation home  business solutions and ge capital in addition to providing information on segments in their entirety we have also provided supplemental information about the businesses within ge capital 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses acquisition costs and other related charges technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team

segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries gecc preferred stock dividends declared and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured these costs are excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for power  water oil  gas energy management aviation healthcare transportation and home  business solutions and are included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for ge capital certain corporate costs such as shared services employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage a portion of the remaining corporate costs are allocated based on each segment’s relative net cost of operations prior to january 1 2011 segment profit excluded the effects of principal pension plans beginning january 1 2011 we began allocating service costs related to our principal pension plans and no longer allocate the retiree costs of our postretirement healthcare benefits to our segments this revised allocation methodology better aligns segment operating costs to the active employee costs which are managed by the segments this change does not significantly affect reported segment results 

we have reclassified certain priorperiod amounts to conform to the currentperiod presentation for additional information about our segments see part i item 1 “business” and note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

power  water revenues of 283 billion increased 26 billion or 10 in 2012 as higher volume 34 billion driven by an increase in sales of equipment at wind and an increase in other income 02 billion were partially offset by the effects of the stronger us dollar 06 billion and lower prices 04 billion 

  

segment profit of 54 billion increased 04 billion or 8 in 2012 as higher volume 07 billion increased other income 02 billion and the impacts of deflation 01 billion were partially offset by lower prices 04 billion lower productivity 01 billion and the effects of the stronger us dollar 01 billion

geographic operations 

 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new opportunities that include among other things more opportunities for expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis the us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 04 billion in 2012 03 billion in 2011 and 02 billion in 2010 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about 04 billion for each of the next two years 

in 2006 we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency epa to dredge pcbcontaining sediment from the upper hudson river the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009 between phase 1 and phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts the panel evaluated the performance of phase 1 dredging operations with respect to phase 1 engineering performance standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards on december 17 2010 epa issued its decision setting forth the final performance standards for phase 2 of the hudson river dredging project incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from ge in december 2010 we agreed to perform phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by epa and increased our reserve by 08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing phase 2 in 2011 we completed the first year of phase 2 dredging and commenced work on planned upgrades to the hudson river wastewater processing facility over the past two years we have dredged 10 million cubic yards from the river and based upon that result and our best professional engineering judgment we believe that our current reserve continues to reflect our probable and estimable costs for the remainder of phase 2 of the dredging project

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria for debt securities our qualitative review considers our intent to sell the security and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security our quantitative review considers whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows unrealized losses are not indicative of the amount of credit loss that would be recognized we presently do not intend to sell the vast majority of our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the vast majority of these securities before recovery of our amortized cost for equity securities we consider the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position we believe that the unrealized loss associated with our equity securities will be recovered within the foreseeable future uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments for additional information relating to how credit losses are calculated see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our rmbs portfolio is collateralized primarily by pools of individual direct mortgage loans a majority of which were originated in 2006 and 2005 not other structured products such as collateralized debt obligations substantially all of our rmbs are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals and more than 70 are agency bonds or insured by monoline insurers monolines on which we continue to place reliance of our total rmbs portfolio at both december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 05 billion relates to residential subprime credit primarily supporting our guaranteed investment contracts a majority of this exposure is related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 substantially all of the subprime rmbs were investment grade at the time of purchase and approximately 70 have been subsequently downgraded to below investment grade 

our cmbs portfolio is collateralized by both diversified pools of mortgages that were originated for securitization conduit cmbs and pools of large loans backed by high quality properties large loan cmbs a majority of which were originated in 2007 and 2006 the vast majority of the securities in our cmbs portfolio have investment grade credit ratings and the vast majority of the securities are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals 

our abs portfolio is collateralized by senior secured loans of highquality middlemarket companies in a variety of industries as well as a variety of diversified pools of assets such as student loans and credit cards the vast majority of the securities in our abs portfolio are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals in addition substantially all of the securities that are below investment grade are in an unrealized gain position 

if there has been an adverse change in cash flows for rmbs management considers credit enhancements such as monoline insurance which are features of a specific security in evaluating the overall creditworthiness of the monoline we use an analysis that is similar to the approach we use for corporate bonds including an evaluation of the sufficiency of the monoline’s cash reserves and capital ratings activity whether the monoline is in default or default appears imminent and the potential for intervention by an insurance or other regulator 

monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities primarily rmbs and municipal securities the credit enhancement is a feature of each specific security that guarantees the payment of all contractual cash flows and is not purchased separately by ge the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities we continue to rely on monolines with adequate capital and claims paying resources we have reduced our reliance on monolines that do not have adequate capital or have experienced regulator intervention at december 31 2012 our investment securities insured by monolines on which we continue to place reliance were 14 billion including 02 billion of our 05 billion investment in subprime rmbs at december 31 2012 the unrealized loss associated with securities subject to monoline credit enhancement for which there is an expected credit loss was 02 billion

fair value measurements  for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date additional information about our application of this guidance is provided in notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report at december 31 2012 the aggregate amount of investments that are measured at fair value through earnings totaled 51 billion and consisted primarily of various assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business as well as equity investments 

working capital  representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections increased 10 billion at december 31 2012 compared to december 31 2011 due to an increase in inventory and lower progress collections partially offset by decreased accounts receivable as power  water oil  gas and aviation deliver units out of their backlogs over the next few years progress collections of 109 billion at december 31 2012 will be earned which along with progress collections on new orders will impact working capital we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

current receivables for ge totaled to 109 billion at the end of 2012 and 118 billion at the end of 2011 and included 79 billion due from customers at the end of 2012 compared with 90 billion at the end of 2011 ge current receivables turnover was 88 in 2012 compared with 83 in 2011 

inventories for ge totaled to 153 billion at december 31 2012 up 16 billion from the end of 2011 this increase reflected higher inventories across all industrial segments ge inventory turnover was 67 and 70 in 2012 and 2011 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows 

our consumer portfolio is composed primarily of nonus mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries and us consumer credit card and sales finance receivables in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes which for our cll business primarily include industrialrelated facilities and equipment vehicles corporate aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation media communications entertainment and healthcare industries the portfolios in our real estate gecas and energy financial services businesses are collateralized by commercial real estate commercial aircraft and operating assets in the global energy and water industries respectively we are in a secured position for substantially all of our commercial portfolio 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examinations process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible to experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio as a result the allowance for losses is not carried over at acquisition this may have the effect of causing lower reserve coverage ratios for those portfolios 

for purposes of the discussion that follows “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection is otherwise doubtful nonearning receivables exclude loans purchased at a discount unless they have deteriorated post acquisition under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 310 receivables  these loans are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition in addition nonearning receivables exclude loans that are paying on a cash accounting basis but classified as nonaccrual and impaired “nonaccrual” financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms but may remain classified as nonaccrual until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 2739 billion at december 31 2012 and 2950 billion at december 31 2011 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 211 billion from december 31 2011 primarily as a result of writeoffs 66 billion dispositions 57 billion collections which includes sales exceeding originations 54 billion partially offset by the weaker us dollar 27 billion 

related nonearning receivables totaled 75 billion 27 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2012 compared with 88 billion 30 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2011 nonearning receivables decreased from december 31 2011 primarily due to writeoffs at cll writeoffs and discounted payoffs at real estate and improved economic conditions in our nonus residential mortgage portfolio 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2012 totaled 50 billion compared with 62 billion at december 31 2011 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio allowance for losses decreased 12 billion from december 31 2011 primarily because provisions were lower than writeoffs net of recoveries by 11 billion which is attributable to a reduction in the overall financing receivables balance and an improvement in the overall credit environment the allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables decreased from 21 at december 31 2011 to 18 at december 31 2012 primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses as discussed above partially offset by a decline in the overall financing receivables balance as collections exceeded originations further information surrounding the allowance for losses related to each of our portfolios is detailed below

the following table provides information surrounding selected ratios related to nonearning financing receivables and the allowance for losses 

 

included below is a discussion of financing receivables allowance for losses nonearning receivables and related metrics for each of our significant portfolios 

cll − americas  nonearning receivables of 13 billion represented 177 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 477 at december 31 2011 to 368 at december 31 2012 reflecting an overall improvement in the credit quality of the remaining portfolio and an overall decrease in nonearning receivables the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 23 at december 31 2011 to 18 at december 31 2012 primarily due to reduced nonearning exposures in most of our portfolios partially offset by declines in overall financing receivables collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables primarily includes assets in the restaurant and hospitality trucking and industrial equipment industries and corporate aircraft and for our leveraged finance business equity of the underlying businesses

cll – europe   nonearning receivables of 13 billion represented 173 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables remained constant at 343 at december 31 2012 reflecting increases in allowance for losses in our interbanca spa and acquisition finance portfolios offset by an increase in nonearning receivables in our interbanca spa and assetbacked lending portfolios the majority of our cll – europe nonearning receivables are attributable to the interbanca spa portfolio which was acquired in 2009 the loans acquired with interbanca spa were recorded at fair value which incorporates an estimate at the acquisition date of credit losses over their remaining life accordingly these loans generally have a lower ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables compared to the remaining portfolio excluding the nonearning loans attributable to the 2009 acquisition of interbanca spa the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 559 at december 31 2011 to 584 at december 31 2012 primarily due to an increase in the allowance for losses in our acquisition finance portfolio the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables increased from 32 at december 31 2011 to 35 at december 31 2012 for the reasons described above collateral supporting these secured nonearning financing receivables are primarily equity of the underlying businesses for our interbanca spa business and equipment for our equipment finance portfolio 

cll – asia  nonearning receivables of 02 billion represented 26 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 584 at december 31 2011 to 415 at december 31 2012 primarily due to a decline in allowance for losses as a result of writeoffs in japan partially offset by collections and writeoffs of nonearning receivables in our assetbased financing businesses in japan the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 23 at december 31 2011 to 17 at december 31 2012 primarily due to writeoffs of nonearning receivables related to our assetbased financing businesses in japan collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables is primarily manufacturing equipment commercial real estate corporate aircraft and assets in the auto industry 

real estate – debt  nonearning receivables of 03 billion represented 43 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the decrease in nonearning receivables from december 31 2011 was driven primarily by the resolution of north american nonearning loans across all asset classes and european multifamily loans through writeoffs payoffs and foreclosures partially offset by new european retail nonearning loans writeoffs increased by approximately 03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a change in our writeoff policies for collateral dependent loans requiring writeoffs for loans with specific reserves aged greater than 360 days the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 1754 to 869 reflecting writeoffs and resolution of nonearning loans as mentioned above the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables decreased from 39 at december 31 2011 to 14 at december 31 2012 driven primarily by the writeoffs mentioned above and transactional events such as settlements and payoffs from impaired loan borrowers and improvement in collateral values 

the real estate financing receivables portfolio is collateralized by incomeproducing or owneroccupied commercial properties across a variety of asset classes and markets at december 31 2012 total real estate financing receivables of 209 billion were primarily collateralized by office buildings 52 billion apartment buildings 34 billion hotel properties 32 billion and retail facilities 29 billion in 2012 commercial real estate markets continue to show signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market and the longterm outlook remains uncertain we have and continue to maintain an intense focus on operations and risk management loan loss reserves related to our real estate–debt financing receivables are particularly sensitive to declines in underlying property values assuming global property values decline an incremental 1 or 5 and that decline occurs evenly across geographies and asset classes we estimate incremental loan loss reserves would be required of less than 01 billion and approximately 02 billion respectively estimating the impact of global property values on loss performance across our portfolio depends on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions property level operating performance local market dynamics and individual borrower behavior as a result any sensitivity analyses or attempts to forecast potential losses carry a high degree of imprecision and are subject to change at december 31 2012 we had 94 foreclosed commercial real estate properties totaling 09 billion

consumer − nonus residential mortgages  nonearning receivables of 26 billion represented 341 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 190 at december 31 2011 to 187 at december 31 2012 in the year ended 2012 our nonearning receivables decreased primarily as a result of improved portfolio quality in the uk our nonus mortgage portfolio has a loantovalue ratio of approximately 76 at origination and the vast majority are first lien positions our uk and france portfolios which comprise a majority of our total mortgage portfolio have reindexed loantovalue ratios of 83 and 56 respectively about 6 of these loans are without mortgage insurance and have a reindexed loantovalue ratio equal to or greater than 100 loantovalue information is updated on a quarterly basis for a majority of our loans and considers economic factors such as the housing price index at december 31 2012 we had in repossession stock 490 houses in the uk which had a value of approximately 01 billion the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 81 at december 31 2011 to 77 at december 31 2012 for the reasons described above 

consumer − nonus installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 02 billion represented 30 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 2726 at december 31 2011 to 2781 at december 31 2012  reflecting lower nonearning receivables due to improved delinquencies collections and writeoffs primarily in australia and new zealand 

consumer − us installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 10 billion represented 136 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2012 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 2028 at december 31 2011 to 2224 at december 31 2012 reflecting an increase in the allowance for losses primarily due to the use of a more granular portfolio segmentation approach by loss type in determining the incurred loss period partially offset by an increase in the nonearning receivables balance the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percentage of financing receivables decreased from 21 at december 31 2011 to 20 at december 31 2012 primarily due to a higher financing receivables balance partially offset by an increase in the nonearning receivables balance 

nonaccrual financing receivables 

 

the following table provides details related to our nonaccrual and nonearning financing receivables nonaccrual financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due substantially all of the differences between nonearning and nonaccrual financing receivables relate to loans which are classified as nonaccrual financing receivables but are paying on a cash accounting basis and therefore excluded from nonearning receivables of our 134 billion nonaccrual loans at december 31 2012 105 billion are currently paying in accordance with their contractual terms

impaired loans 

 

“impaired” loans in the table below are defined as larger balance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement the vast majority of our consumer and a portion of our cll nonaccrual receivables are excluded from this definition as they represent smaller balance homogeneous loans that we evaluate collectively by portfolio for impairment 

impaired loans include nonearning receivables on larger balance or restructured loans loans that are currently paying interest under the cash basis but are excluded from the nonearning category and loans paying currently but which have been previously restructured 

specific reserves are recorded for individually impaired loans to the extent we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement certain loans classified as impaired may not require a reserve because we believe that we will ultimately collect the unpaid balance through collection or collateral repossession 

 

further information pertaining to loans classified as impaired and specific reserves is included in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

we regularly review our real estate loans for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors such as debt service coverage and loantovalue ratios we classify real estate loans as impaired when the most recent valuation reflects a projected loantovalue ratio at maturity in excess of 100 even if the loan is currently paying in accordance with contractual terms 

of our 57 billion impaired loans at real estate at december 31 2012 53 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and are typically loans where the borrower has adequate debt service coverage to meet contractual interest obligations impaired loans at cll primarily represent senior secured lending positions

our impaired loan balance at december 31 2012 and 2011 classified by the method used to measure impairment was as follows 

 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions forbearance or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr and also as impaired changes to real estate’s loans primarily include maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions of our commercial loans meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances at december 31 2012 tdrs included in impaired loans were 121 billion primarily relating to real estate 51 billion cll 39 billion and consumer 31 billion 

real estate tdrs decreased from 70 billion at december 31 2011 to 51 billion at december 31 2012 primarily driven by resolution of tdrs through paydowns restructuring foreclosures and writeoffs partially offset by extensions of loans scheduled to mature during 2012 some of which were classified as tdrs upon modification for borrowers with demonstrated operating capabilities we work to restructure loans when the cash flow and projected value of the underlying collateral support repayment over the modified term we deem loan modifications to be tdrs when we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty and we do not receive adequate compensation in the form of an effective interest rate that is at current market rates of interest given the risk characteristics of the loan or other consideration that compensates us for the value of the concession for the year ended december 31 2012 we modified 44 billion of loans classified as tdrs substantially all in our debt portfolio changes to these loans primarily included maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral or covenant terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the limited liquidity and higher return requirements in the real estate market for loans with higher loantovalue ltv ratios has typically resulted in the conclusion that the modified terms are not at current market rates of interest even if the modified loans are expected to be fully recoverable we received the same or additional compensation in the form of rate increases and fees for the majority of these tdrs of our 44 billion of modifications classified as tdrs in the last twelve months 02 billion have subsequently experienced a payment default 

the substantial majority of the real estate tdrs have reserves determined based upon collateral value our specific reserves on real estate tdrs were 02 billion at december 31 2012 and 06 billion at december 31 2011 and were 31 and 84 respectively of real estate tdrs in many situations these loans did not require a specific reserve as collateral value adequately covered our recorded investment in the loan while these modified loans had adequate collateral coverage we were still required to complete our tdr classification evaluation on each of the modifications without regard to collateral adequacy

we utilize certain shortterm three months or less loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary financial difficulties in our consumer loan portfolio these loan modification programs are primarily concentrated in our nonus residential mortgage and nonus installment and revolving portfolios we sold our us residential mortgage business in 2007 and as such do not participate in the us governmentsponsored mortgage modification programs for the year ended december 31 2012 we provided shortterm modifications of approximately 03 billion of consumer loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties substantially all in our nonus residential mortgage credit card and personal loan portfolios which are not classified as tdrs for these modified loans we provided insignificant interest rate reductions and payment deferrals which were not part of the terms of the original contract we expect borrowers whose loans have been modified under these shortterm programs to continue to be able to meet their contractual obligations upon the conclusion of the shortterm modification in addition we have modified 18 billion of consumer loans for the year ended december 31 2012 which are classified as tdrs further information on consumer impaired loans is provided in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

gecc selected european exposures 

 

at december 31 2012 we had 889 billion in financing receivables to consumer and commercial customers in europe the gecc financing receivables portfolio in europe is well diversified across european geographies and customers approximately 87 of the portfolio is secured by collateral and represents approximately 500000 commercial customers several european countries including spain portugal ireland italy greece and hungary “focus countries” have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations the carrying value of gecc funded exposures in these focus countries and in the rest of europe comprised the following at december 31 2012

we manage counterparty exposure including credit risk on an individual counterparty basis we place defined risk limits around each obligor and review our risk exposure on the basis of both the primary and parent obligor as well as the issuer of securities held as collateral these limits are adjusted on an ongoing basis based on our continuing assessment of the credit risk of the obligor or issuer in setting our counterparty risk limits we focus on high quality credits and diversification through spread of risk in an effort to actively manage our overall exposure we actively monitor each exposure against these limits and take appropriate action when we believe that risk limits have been exceeded or there are excess risk concentrations our collateral position and ability to work out problem accounts has historically mitigated our actual loss experience delinquency experience has been relatively stable in our european commercial and consumer platforms in the aggregate and we actively monitor and take action to reduce

exposures where appropriate uncertainties surrounding european markets could have an impact on the judgments and estimates used in determining the carrying value of these assets 

 

other gecc receivables totaled 140 billion at december 31 2012 and 134 billion at december 31 2011 and consisted of insurance receivables amounts due from ge primarily related to material procurement programs of 35 billion at both december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 nonfinancing customer receivables amounts due under operating leases amounts accrued from investment income tax receivables and various sundry items 

property plant and equipment totaled 697 billion at december 31 2012 up 40 billion from 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in machinery and equipment at ge and in equipment leased to others principally as a result of aircraft acquisitions at our gecas leasing business ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecc was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

included in other assets are real estate equity investments of 207 billion and 239 billion at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type we review the estimated values of our commercial real estate investments annually or more frequently as conditions warrant based on the most recent valuation estimates available the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 11 billion this amount is subject to variation and dependent on economic and market conditions changes in cash flow estimates and composition of our portfolio including sales such as our recently announced disposition of certain floors located at 30 rockefeller center new york to an affiliate of nbcu commercial real estate valuations have shown signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets primarily in the us however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market accordingly there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses during 2012 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 01 billion in its real estate held for investment which were primarily driven by declining cash flow projections for properties in japan and europe as well as strategic decisions to sell portfolios in asia and europe real estate investments with undiscounted cash flows in excess of carrying value of 0 to 5 at december 31 2012 had a carrying value of 21 billion and an associated estimated unrealized loss of an insignificant amount continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized 

contract costs and estimated earnings reflect revenues earned in excess of billings on our longterm contracts to construct technically complex equipment such as power generation aircraft engines and aeroderivative units and longterm product maintenance or extended warranty arrangements our total contract costs and estimated earnings balances at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 were 94 billion and 90 billion respectively reflecting the timing of billing in relation to work performed as well as changes in estimates of future revenues and costs our total contract costs and estimated earnings balance at december 31 2012 primarily related to customers in our power  water oil  gas aviation and transportation businesses further information is provided in the critical accounting estimates section 

liquidity and borrowings 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity at both ge and gecc we manage our liquidity to help provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles 

our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and gecc are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes at ge our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment payroll and general expenses including pension funding we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives including paying dividends repurchasing shares investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses at ge we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities any dividend payments from gecc and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the us principally within fiscal quarters during 2012 gecc paid dividends of 19 billion and special dividends of 45 billion to ge 

gecc’s liquidity position is targeted to meet its obligations under both normal and stressed conditions gecc establishes a funding plan annually that is based on the projected asset size and cash needs of the company which over the past few years has included our strategy to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital gecc relies on a diversified source of funding including the unsecured term debt markets the global commercial paper markets deposits secured funding retail funding products bank borrowings and securitizations to fund its balance sheet in addition to cash generated through collection of principal interest and other payments on the existing portfolio of loans and leases to fund its operating and interest expense costs

our 2013 gecc funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding shortterm borrowings including the current portion of longterm debt 443 billion at december 31 2012 through issuance of longterm debt and reissuance of commercial paper cash on hand collections of financing receivables exceeding originations dispositions asset sales and deposits and other alternative sources of funding longterm maturities and early redemptions were 88 billion in 2012 interest on borrowings is primarily repaid through interest earned on existing financing receivables during 2012 gecc earned interest income on financing receivables of 210 billion which more than offset interest expense of 117 billion 

we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for gecc which includes a requirement to maintain a contingency funding plan the liquidity policy defines gecc’s liquidity risk tolerance under different stress scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues we actively monitor gecc’s access to funding markets and its liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise 

gecc is a savings and loan holding company under us law and became subject to federal reserve board frb supervision on july 21 2011 the oneyear anniversary of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act dfa the frb has recently finalized a regulation that requires certain organizations it supervises to submit annual capital plans for review including institutions’ plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments the applicability and timing of this proposed regulation to gecc is not yet determined however the frb has indicated that it expects to extend these requirements to large savings and loan holding companies through separate rulemaking or by order while gecc is not yet subject to this regulation gecc’s capital allocation planning is still subject to frb review the frb recently proposed regulations to revise and replace its current rules on capital adequacy and we have taken the proposed regulations into consideration in our current capital planning the proposed regulations would apply to savings and loan holding companies like gecc the transition period for achieving compliance with the proposed regulations following final adoption is unclear as expected the us financial stability oversight council fsoc recently notified gecc that it is under consideration for a proposed determination as a nonbank systemically important financial institution nonbank sifi under the dfa while not final such a determination would subject gecc to proposed enhanced supervisory standards 

actions taken to strengthen and maintain our liquidity are described in the following section 

liquidity sources 

 

we maintain liquidity sources that consist of cash and equivalents and a portfolio of highquality liquid investments and committed unused credit lines 

we have consolidated cash and equivalents of 774 billion at december 31 2012 which is available to meet our needs of this approximately 16 billion is held at ge and approximately 62 billion is held at gecc 

in addition to our 774 billion of cash and equivalents we have a centrally managed portfolio of highquality liquid investments at gecc with a fair value of 31 billion at december 31 2012 this portfolio is used to manage liquidity and meet the operating needs of gecc under both normal and stress scenarios the investments consist of unencumbered us government securities us agency securities securities guaranteed by the government supranational securities and a select group of nonus government securities we believe that we can readily obtain cash for these securities even in stressed market conditions 

we have committed unused credit lines totaling 482 billion that have been extended to us by 51 financial institutions at december 31 2012 gecc can borrow up to 482 billion under all of these credit lines ge can borrow up to 120 billion under certain of these credit lines these lines include 303 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 179 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for one or two years from the date of expiration of the lending agreement 

 

 

  

62 

  

  

  

cash and equivalents of 532 billion at december 31 2012 are held outside of the us of this amount at yearend 144 billion is indefinitely reinvested indefinitely reinvested cash held outside of the us is available to fund operations and other growth of non us subsidiaries it is also used to fund our needs in the us on a shortterm basis through shortterm loans without being subject to us tax under the internal revenue code these loans are permitted to be outstanding for 30 days or less and the total of all such loans are required to be outstanding for less than 60 days during the year 

18 billion of ge cash and equivalents is held in countries with currency controls that may restrict the transfer of funds to the us or limit our ability to transfer funds to the us without incurring substantial costs these funds are available to fund operations and growth in these countries and we do not currently anticipate a need to transfer these funds to the us 

at gecc about 10 billion of cash and equivalents are in regulated banks and insurance entities and are subject to regulatory restrictions 

if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested cash held outside the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 

funding plan 

 

we have reduced our ge capital ending net investment excluding cash and equivalents from 513 billion at january 1 2009 to 419 billion at december 31 2012 

during 2012 ge completed issuances of 70 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 30 years gecc issued 339 billion of senior unsecured debt and 17 billion of secured debt excluding securitizations described below with maturities up to 40 years and subsequent to december 31 2012 an additional 131 billion average commercial paper borrowings for gecc and ge during the fourth quarter were 404 billion and 102 billion respectively and the maximum amounts of commercial paper borrowings outstanding for gecc and ge during the fourth quarter were 431 billion and 148 billion respectively gecc commercial paper maturities are funded principally through new commercial paper issuances and at ge are substantially repaid before quarterend using indefinitely reinvested overseas cash which as discussed above is available for use in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation’s fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp the fdic guaranteed certain senior unsecured debt issued by gecc on or before october 31 2009 as of december 31 2012 our tlgpguaranteed debt was fully repaid 

we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding during 2012 we completed 158 billion of nonrecourse issuances and had maturities and deconsolidations of 149 billion at december 31 2012 consolidated nonrecourse borrowings were 301 billion 

 

we have deposittaking capability at 12 banks outside of the us and two banks in the us – ge capital retail bank a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit cds in maturity terms from two months to ten years on january 11 2013 the fsb acquired the deposit business of metlife bank na this acquisition adds approximately 64 billion in deposits and an online banking platform 

total alternative funding at december 31 2012 was 101 billion composed mainly of 46 billion of bank deposits 30 billion of nonrecourse securitization borrowings 10 billion of funding secured by real estate aircraft and other collateral and 8 billion of ge interest plus notes the comparable amount at december 31 2011 was 96 billion

as a matter of general practice we routinely evaluate the economic impact of calling debt instruments where gecc has the right to exercise a call in determining whether to call debt we consider the economic benefit to gecc of calling debt the effect of calling debt on gecc’s liquidity profile and other factors in 2012 we called 86 billion of longterm debt of which 45 billion was settled before year end 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used described further below and should not be viewed as a forecast actual effects would depend on many variables including market factors and the composition of the company’s assets and liabilities at that time 

 

 

 

debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

credit ratings 

 

on april 3 2012 moody’s investors service moody’s announced that it had downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of ge by one notch from aa2 to aa3 and the senior unsecured debt rating of gecc by two notches from aa2 to a1 the ratings downgrade did not affect ge’s and gecc’s shortterm funding ratings of p1 which were affirmed by moody’s moody’s ratings outlook for ge and gecc is stable we did not experience any material operational funding or liquidity impacts from this ratings downgrade as of december 31 2012 ge’s and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt ratings from standard and poor’s ratings service sp were aa with a stable outlook and their shortterm funding ratings from sp were a1 we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

substantially all gics were affected by the downgrade and are more fully discussed in the principal debt and derivative conditions section additionally there were other contracts affected by the downgrade with provisions requiring us to provide additional funding post collateral and make other payments the total cash and collateral impact of these contracts was less than 05 billion 

principal debt and derivative conditions 

 

certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings 

  

64 

  

  

  

fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on among other factors market movements and changes in our positions we manage counterparty credit risk the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements on an individual counterparty basis where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response including requiring additional collateral 

swap forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the longterm credit ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below aa3 in certain of these master agreements the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the shortterm ratings of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a1p1 the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be 03 billion at december 31 2012 see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other debt and derivative agreements of consolidated entities include trinity which comprises two entities that hold investment securities the majority of which are investment grade and were funded by the issuance of gics these gics included conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the longterm credit ratings of gecc fall below aaaa3 or the shortterm credit ratings fall below a1p1 the trinity assets and liabilities are disclosed in note a on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report another consolidated entity also had issued gics where proceeds are loaned to gecc these gics included conditions under which certain holders could require immediate repayment of their investment should the longterm credit ratings of gecc fall below aaaa3 these obligations are included in longterm borrowings on our statement of financial position in the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report these three consolidated entities ceased issuing gics in 2010 

 

following the april 3 2012 moody’s downgrade of gecc’s longterm credit rating to a1 substantially all of these gics became redeemable by their holders in 2012 holders of 24 billion in principal amount of gics redeemed their holdings and gecc made related cash payments the remaining outstanding gics will continue to be subject to their scheduled maturities and individual terms which may include provisions permitting redemption upon a downgrade of one or more of gecc’s ratings among other things 

  

ratio of earnings to fixed charges income maintenance agreement and subordinated debentures 

 

ge provides implicit and explicit support to gecc through commitments capital contributions and operating support for example and as discussed below ge has committed to keep gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges above a minimum level in addition ge has made a total of 150 billion of capital contributions to gecc in 2009 and 2008 to improve tangible capital and reduce leverage gecc’s credit rating is higher than it would be on a standalone basis as a result of this financial support 

  

on march 28 1991 ge entered into an agreement with gecc to make payments to gecc constituting additions to pretax income under the agreement to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc and consolidated affiliates determined on a consolidated basis to be not less than 1101 for the period as a single aggregation of each gecc fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991 gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1641 for 2012 no payment is required in 2013 pursuant to this agreement 

any payment made under the income maintenance agreement will not affect the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as determined in accordance with current sec rules because it does not constitute an addition to pretax income under current us gaap 

in addition in connection with certain subordinated debentures of gecc that may be classified as equity hybrid debt during events of default or interest deferral periods under such subordinated debentures gecc has agreed not to declare or pay any dividends or distributions or make certain other payments with respect to its capital stock and ge has agreed to promptly return any payments made to ge in violation of this agreement there were 73 billion of such debentures outstanding at december 31 2012 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

shareowners’ equity 

 

effective with 2012 reporting activity affecting shareowners’ equity is presented in two statements the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the elements of other comprehensive income previously disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity are now presented in the new consolidated statement of comprehensive income which combines those elements with net earnings an analysis of changes in the elements of shareowners’ equity as presented in these two statements follows 

ge shareowners’ equity increased by 66 billion in 2012 compared with a decrease of 25 billion in 2011 and an increase of 16 billion in 2010 

net earnings increased ge shareowners equity by 136 billion 142 billion and 116 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 74 billion 75 billion including 08 billion related to our preferred stock redemption and 52 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci increased shareowners’ equity by 37 billion in 2012 compared with decreases of 61 billion in 2011 and 23 billion in 2010 respectively inclusive of changes in accounting principles the components of these changes are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

  

66 

 

  

  

 

noncontrolling interests included in shareowners’ equity increased 37 billion in 2012 principally as a result of the issuance of preferred stock by gecc noncontrolling interests decreased by 36 billion in 2011 and 26 billion in 2010 principally as a result of dispositions 

statement of cash flows – overview from 2010 through 2012 

 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 774 billion at december 31 2012 a decrease of 71 billion from december 31 2011 cash and equivalents totaled 845 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 56 billion from december 31 2010 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets and deposits as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

ge cash flows 

 

ge cash and equivalents were 155 billion at december 31 2012 compared with 84 billion at december 31 2011 ge cfoa totaled 178 billion in 2012 compared with 121 billion and 147 billion in 2011 and 2010 respectively with respect to ge cfoa we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

ge cfoa increased 58 billion compared with 2011 primarily due to dividends paid by gecc of 64 billion in 2011 ge cfoa decreased 27 billion compared with 2010 primarily due to the impact of the disposal of nbcu 

 

 

 

  

67 

 

  

  

the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections increased by 118 billion in 2012 and decreased by 46 billion in 2011 these changes are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues including the impact of acquisitions primarily at power  water and oil  gas analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section are the best way of understanding our customerrelated cfoa 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services ge operating cash payments increased by 125 billion in 2012 and decreased by 20 billion in 2011 these changes are consistent with the changes in ge total costs and expenses including the impact of acquisitions primarily at power  water and oil  gas 

dividends from gecc including special dividends represent the distribution of a portion of gecc retained earnings and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses the amounts we show in ge cfoa are the total dividends including special dividends from excess capital beginning in the second quarter of 2012 gecc restarted its dividend to ge during 2012 gecc paid dividends of 19 billion and special dividends of 45 billion to ge there were no dividends received from gecc in 2011 or 2010 

on october 9 2012 ge issued 70 billion of notes impacting our cash flows from financing activities on february 1 2013 we repaid 50 billion of ge senior unsecured notes 

gecc cash flows 

 

gecc cash and equivalents were 619 billion at december 31 2012 compared with 767 billion at december 31 2011 gecc cfoa totaled 220 billion for 2012 compared with cash from operating activities of 211 billion for the same period of 2011 this was primarily due to increases compared to the prior year in net cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 17 billion partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of 09 billion 

consistent with our plan to reduce gecc asset levels cash from investing activities was 145 billion in 2012 primarily resulting from a 54 billion reduction in financing receivables due to collections which includes sales exceeding originations 47 billion related to net loan repayments from our equity method investments proceeds from principal business dispositions of 29 billion and 28 billion from sales of real estate held for investment and equity method investments these increases were partially offset by 57 billion of net purchases of equipment leased to others elto 

gecc cash used for financing activities in 2012 of 525 billion related primarily to a 495 billion reduction in total borrowings consisting primarily of net reductions in longterm borrowings and commercial paper 65 billion of dividends paid to shareowners including 01 billion paid to gecc preferred shareowners and 20 billion of redemptions of guaranteed investment contracts at trinity partially offset by 40 billion of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and 24 billion of higher deposits at our banks 

gecc pays dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales 

intercompany eliminations 

 

effects of transactions between related companies are made on an armslength basis are eliminated and consist primarily of gecc dividends to ge ge customer receivables sold to gecc gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecc information technology it and other services sold to gecc by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs for further information related to intercompany eliminations see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2012 follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variable interest entities vies 

 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions 

the assets we currently securitize include receivables secured by equipment credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business the securitizations are funded with variable funding notes and term debt 

substantially all of our securitization vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement 

at december 31 2012 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 484 billion and 329 billion respectively an increase of 17 billion and a decrease of 23 billion from 2011 respectively assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our other assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

  

69 

  

  

  

at december 31 2012 investments in unconsolidated vies including our noncontrolling interest in ptl were 126 billion a decrease of 39 billion from 2011 primarily related to a decrease of 50 billion in ptl partially offset by an increase of 10 billion in an investment in assetbacked securities issued by a senior secured loan fund in addition to our existing investments we have contractual obligations to fund additional investments in the unconsolidated vies to fund new asset origination at december 31 2012 these contractual obligations were 27 billion a decrease of 16 billion from 2011 

we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred financing receivables to any vie in either 2012 or 2011 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates writeoffs in both our consumer and commercial portfolios can also reflect both losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of a fiscal year and information becoming available during that fiscal year which may identify further deterioration on exposures existing prior to the beginning of that fiscal year and for which reserves could not have been previously recognized our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

further information is provided in the global risk management section and financial resources and liquidity – financing receivables section of this item the asset impairment section that follows and in notes 1 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments increased earnings by 04 billion in 2012 increased earnings by 04 billion in 2011 and decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2010 we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

further information is provided in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use quoted market prices when available our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals as appropriate

our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in ge capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on managements best estimate in determining its best estimate management evaluates average current market values obtained from third parties of similar type and age aircraft which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 02 billion and 03 billion in 2012 and 2011 respectively provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were an insignificant amount for both 2012 and 2011 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 7 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments annually or more frequently as conditions warrant the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values based on the most recent valuation estimates available the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 11 billion this amount is subject to variation dependent on the assumptions described above changes in economic and market conditions and composition of our portfolio including sales commercial real estate valuations have shown signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets primarily in the us however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market accordingly there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon cash flow estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about capitalization rates and expected trends in rents and occupancy and is corroborated by external appraisals during 2012 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 01 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 12 billion in 2011 continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets results in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management and the all other assets sections of this item and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach when available and appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results for purposes of the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 80 to 130 valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 

compared to the market approach the income approach more closely aligns each reporting unit valuation to our business profile including geographic markets served and product offerings required rates of return along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows are reflected in the selection of the discount rate equally important under this approach reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future states that may not be reflected in an observable market price a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples it can be somewhat more limited in its application because the population of potential comparables is often limited to publicly traded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or nonpublic subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg synergies between the parties terms and conditions of the transaction etc may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business it can also be difficult under certain market conditions to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar businesses we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results if current conditions persist longer or deteriorate further than expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for highquality fixedincome securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense 

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 396 421 and 528 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and target asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future longterm return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we formulate views on the future economic environment both in the us and abroad we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth inflation valuations yields and spreads using both internal and external sources we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations assets in our principal pension plans earned 117 in 2012 and had average annual earnings of 72 61 and 89 per year in the 10 15 and 25year periods ended december 31 2012 respectively these average historical returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008 based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and target asset allocations we have assumed an 80 longterm expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2013 compared to 80 in both 2012 and 2011 and 85 in 2010 

changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company at december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 108 billion and 102 billion of earnings respectively have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations because of the availability of us foreign tax credits it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 48 billion at both december 31 2012 and 2011 including 08 billion and 09 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances associated with losses reported in discontinued operations primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan such yearend 2012 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation as applicable 

at december 31 2012 derivative assets and liabilities were 39 billion and 03 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 9 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and longlived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investments and longlived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs 

a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates

supplemental information 

 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this form 10k report to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

 

  

78 

  

  

  

we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as industrial cfoa which we define as ge’s cash from continuing operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecc this includes the effects of intercompany transactions including ge customer receivables sold to gecc gecc services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecc information technology it and other services sold to gecc by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecc from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge’s operating cash flows without the effect of gecc dividends since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from periodtoperiod based upon the results of the financial services businesses management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services gecc cash flows we believe that our measure of industrial cfoa provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flows with the operating cash flows of other nonfinancial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure

operating earnings excludes nonservice related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gainslosses the service cost and prior service cost components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees as such we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan we also believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies we believe that presenting operating earnings separately for our industrial businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company we also believe that operating eps excluding the effects of the 08 billion preferred dividend related to the redemption of our preferred stock calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock is a meaningful measure because it increases the comparability of periodtoperiod results 

 

  

80 

  

  

  

we have provided the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans operating pension costs comprise the service cost of benefits earned and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans nonoperating pension costs income comprise the expected return on plan assets interest cost on benefit obligations and net actuarial loss amortization for our principal pension plans we believe that the operating components of pension costs better reflect the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees we believe that the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our pension plan costs and operating results with the pension plan costs and operating results of other companies 

 

 

organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions business dispositions and currency exchange rates we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions dispositions and currency exchange which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends we also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial segments provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other nonfinancial businesses and companies management recognizes that the term “organic revenue growth” may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective business or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing periodtoperiod performance trends

a used for computing return on average ge shareowners’ equity and return on average total capital invested rotc 

 

 

 

 

our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings our calculation of average ge shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary 

 

 

we have provided the gecc ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents to reduce debt and with longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace certain longterm debt with equity despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses 

  

82 

 

  

  

 

a as originally reported 

 

we use eni to measure the size of our ge capital segment we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital debt or equity required to fund a business as it adjusts for noninterest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay we also believe that by excluding cash and equivalents we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our ge capital segment as a substantial amount of this cash and equivalents resulted from debt issuances to prefund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment 

 

 

 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecc net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecc earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecc tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses

potential sales for any engine are limited by among other things its technological lifetime which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology the small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles although these cycles differ from each other

because of the diversity of our products and services as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities we use numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations we have not been adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials 

we own or hold licenses to use numerous patents new patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities as existing patents expire patented inventions are used both within the company and are licensed to others but no operating segment is substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 “business” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

  

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section and in the business descriptions in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report below we describe certain important operational and strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

our growth is subject to global economic and political risks 

we operate in virtually every part of the world and serve customers in more than 100 countries in 2011 approximately 53 of our revenue was attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition and geopolitical risks they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these global economic and political risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of more volatile market conditions 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular us and nonus governments are undertaking a substantial revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and nonbank financial institutions consumer lending the overthecounter derivatives market and tax laws and regulations which changes may have an effect on ge’s and ge capital’s structure operations liquidity effective tax rate and performance we are also subject to a number of trade control laws and regulations that may affect our ability to sell our products in global markets in addition we are subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local capital requirements that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with nonus banks and other nonus financial institutions in global markets this provision which expired at the end of 2011 had been scheduled to expire and had been extended by congress on six previous occasions including in december of 2010 but there can be no assurance that it will be extended including retroactively in the event the provision is not extended after 2011 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2012 in addition efforts by public and private sectors to control the growth of healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers continued government scrutiny including reviews of the us food and drug administration us fda medical device premarket authorization and postmarket surveillance processes may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an

adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in us and international governmental programs which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators and other governmental authorities which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time 

  

the success of our business depends on achieving our strategic objectives including through acquisitions joint ventures and dispositions 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures we may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology we also participate in a number of joint ventures with other companies or government enterprises in various markets around the world including joint ventures where we may not have control by their nature these collaborations may involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture which may expose us to additional operational financial legal or compliance risks we also continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results 

  

sustained increases in costs of pension and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we use to estimate pension expense for 2012 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated gains losses – net benefit plans at the end of 2011 the ge pension plan was underfunded on a us gaap basis by 132 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 52 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors which could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility could 

  

16 

  

also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees may increase future funding obligations although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability 

conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of funding 

as disclosed in more detail in the liquidity and borrowings section in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k report a large portion of our borrowings is in the form of commercial paper and longterm debt we continue to rely on the availability of the unsecured debt markets to access funding for term maturities for 2012 and beyond and to fund our operations without incurring additional us tax in addition we rely on the availability of the commercial paper markets to refinance maturing commercial paper debt throughout the year in order to further diversify our funding sources ge capital continues to expand its reliance on alternative sources of funding including bank deposits securitizations and other assetbased funding there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing the diversification of our funding sources or that the short and longterm credit markets will be available or if available that the cost of funding will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability factors that may cause an increase in our funding costs include a decreased reliance on shortterm funding such as commercial paper in favor of longerterm funding arrangements decreased capacity and increased competition among debt issuers and increased competition for deposits in our affiliate banks’ markets if ge capital’s cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect its competitive position and result in lower lending margins earnings and cash flows as well as lower returns on its shareowner’s equity and invested capital 

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate they may adversely affect the business and results of operations of ge capital as well as the soundness of financial institutions and governments we deal with 

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets including goodwill intangibles and tax assets in addition deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase allowances for loan losses impairments or writeoffs which depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

in addition ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties including sovereign governments and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the collateral held cannot be realized upon sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to initial credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which are designed to limit credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

  

the real estate markets in which ge capital participates are highly dependent on economic conditions the deterioration of which may adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

ge capital participates in the commercial real estate market in two ways it provides financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties and it also acquires equity positions in various types of properties or real estate investments the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the economic conditions in specific geographic markets in which the properties are located and the perceived value of those markets at the time of sale the level of transactions for real estate assets continue to remain at levels below historical norms in many of the markets in which ge capital operates high levels of unemployment slowdown in business activity excess inventory capacity and limited availability of credit may continue to adversely affect the value of real estate assets and collateral to real estate loans ge capital holds under current market and credit 

  

17 

  

conditions there can be no assurance as to the level of sales ge capital will complete or the net sales proceeds it will realize also occupancy rates and market rent levels may worsen which may result in impairments to the carrying value of equity investments or increases in the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans 

  

ge capital is also a residential mortgage lender in certain geographic markets outside the united states that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declines in real estate values and home sale volumes job losses consumer bankruptcies and other factors that may negatively impact the credit performance of our mortgage loans our allowance for loan losses on these mortgage loans is based on our analysis of current and historical delinquency and loan performance as well as other management assumptions that may be inaccurate predictors of credit performance in this environment there can be no assurance that in this environment credit performance will not be materially worse than anticipated and as a result materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting as of december 31 2011 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was “aa” the second highest of 22 rating categories with a stable outlook and from moody’s investors service “moody’s” was “aa2” the third highest of 21 rating categories with a stable outlook as of december 31 2011 ge ge capital services and ge capital’s shortterm credit rating from sp was “a1” the highest rating category of six categories and from moody’s was “p1” the highest rating category of four categories there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade which depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position 

current conditions in the global economy and the major industries we serve also may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our nonfinancial businesses 

the business and operating results of our industrial businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions including conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare home building and other major industries we serve as a result of slower global economic growth the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence increased unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures fluctuating commodity prices bankruptcies government deficit reduction and austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy some of our customers have experienced deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion in particular the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and international economies an extended period of slow growth in the us or internationally that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers and the viability of their business service contract cancellations could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if slower growth in the global economy continues for a significant period or there is significant deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

increased it security requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions services and data 

increased global it security requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats we

also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we may face quality problems from operational failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations and we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our and thirdparty products that incorporate or use leadingedge technology including both hardware and software while we have built extensive operational processes to ensure that the design manufacture and servicing of such products meet the most rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers will not experience operational process failures that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks such operational failures or quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations in addition the markets in which we operate are subject to technological change our longterm operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative products to modify existing products to customize products to respond to technological change and to execute our product development in line with our projected cost estimates 

our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours 

our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we could also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio we also face attempts by thirdparties to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming if ge is found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms 

significant raw material shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials parts components systems and services a disruption in deliveries from our thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers or service providers capacity constraints production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs quality and sourcing issues experienced by thirdparty providers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm

in the accompanying analysis of financial information we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission sec rules for such measures we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in the supplemental information section 

we present management’s discussion of operations in five parts overview of our earnings from 2009 through 2011 global risk management segment operations geographic operations and environmental matters unless otherwise indicated we refer to captions such as revenues and earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company simply as “revenues” and “earnings” throughout this management’s discussion and analysis similarly discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

effective january 1 2011 we reorganized the former technology infrastructure segment into three segments – aviation healthcare and transportation the priorperiod results of the aviation healthcare and transportation businesses are unaffected by this reorganization results for 2011 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2011 

on february 22 2012 we merged our whollyowned subsidiary gecs with and into gecs’ whollyowned subsidiary gecc the merger simplified our financial services’ corporate structure by consolidating financial services entities and assets within our organization and simplifying securities and exchange commission and regulatory reporting upon the merger gecc became the surviving corporation and assumed all of gecs’ rights and obligations and became whollyowned directly by general electric our financial services segment ge capital will continue to comprise the continuing operations of gecc which now includes the runoff insurance operations previously held and managed in gecs references to gecs gecc and the ge capital segment in this form 10k report relate to the entities or segment as they existed during 2011 and do not reflect the february 22 2012 merger 

we supplement our gaap net earnings and earnings per share eps reporting by also reporting an operating earnings and eps measure nongaap operating earnings and eps include service cost and plan amendment amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee benefits earned operating earnings and eps exclude nonoperating pension costincome such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses we believe that this reporting provides better transparency to the employee benefit costs of our principal pension plans and company operating results

overview of our earnings from 2009 through 2011 

earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company increased 12 in 2011 and 16 in 2010 reflecting the stabilization of overall economic conditions during the last two years following the challenging conditions of 2009 operating earnings nongaap measure which exclude nonoperating pension costs increased 20 to 148 billion in 2011 compared with 123 billion in 2010 operating earnings per share nongaap measure increased 15 to 129 in 2011 compared with 112 in 2010 operating earnings per share excluding the effects of our preferred stock redemption nongaap measure increased 22 to 137 in 2011 compared with 112 in 2010 we believe that we are seeing continued signs of stabilization in much of the global economy including in financial services as gecs earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company increased 113 in 2011 and 157 in 2010 net earnings attributable to the company increased 22 in 2011 reflecting the lack of prior year losses from discontinued operations and a 12 increase in earnings from continuing operations after increasing 6 in 2010 as losses from discontinued operations in 2010 partially offset the 16 increase in earnings from continuing operations we begin 2012 with a record backlog of 200 billion and expect to continue our trend of revenue and earnings growth 

energy infrastructure 27 and 39 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively revenues increased 16 in 2011 primarily as a result of acquisitions during 2011 and higher volume due to increased sales of services at energy and oil  gas after decreasing 8 in 2010 as the worldwide demand for new sources of power such as wind and thermal declined with the overall economic conditions segment profit decreased 9 in 2011 primarily on lower productivity driven by the wind turbines business acquisitions and investment in our global organization and new technology and lower prices segment profit increased 2 in 2010 primarily on higher prices and lower material and other costs we continue to invest in marketleading technology and services at energy and oil  gas 

aviation 12 and 20 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively revenues and segment profit increased 7 and 6 respectively in 2011 and fell 6 and 16 respectively in 2010 we continue to invest in marketleading technologies and services at aviation aviation revenues and earnings increased in 2011 as a result of higher volume and higher prices primarily driven by increased services and equipment sales in 2010 aviation revenues decreased from a reduction in volume reflecting decreased commercial and military equipment sales and services earnings decreased as a result of lower productivity primarily due to product launch and production costs associated with the genx engine shipments 

healthcare 11 and 15 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively revenues and segment profit increased 7 and 2 respectively in 2011 and 6 and 13 respectively in 2010 we continue to invest in marketleading technologies and services at healthcare healthcare revenues increased over this period on increased volume from higher equipment sales and services and the effects of the weaker us dollar healthcare earnings improved over this period on increased productivity higher volume and the effects of weaker us dollar 

transportation 3 and 3 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively revenues and segment profit increased 45 and more than 100 respectively in 2011 and fell 12 and 33 respectively in 2010 we continue to invest in marketleading technologies and services at transportation transportation revenues improved in 2011 due to higher volume related to increased equipment sales and services transportation earnings increased as a result of increased productivity reflecting improved service margins and higher volume while they declined in 2010 as the weakened economy had driven overall reductions in us freight traffic and we updated our estimates of longterm product service costs in our maintenance service agreements 

home  business solutions 6 and 2 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively revenues have decreased 2 in 2011 and increased 2 in 2010 home  business solutions revenues trended down as a result of lower volume in appliances the revenue increase in 2010 was related to increased volume across all businesses segment profit decreased 34 in 2011 after increasing 24 in 2010 primarily as a result of lower volume and the effects of inflation

ge capital 31 and 21 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively net earnings increased to 65 billion in 2011 and 32 billion in 2010 due to the continued stabilization in the overall economic environment over the last several years we tightened underwriting standards shifted teams from origination to collection and maintained a proactive risk management focus this along with recent increased stability in the financial markets contributed to lower losses and a significant increase in segment profit in 2011 and 2010 we also reduced our ending net investment eni excluding cash and equivalents from 526 billion at january 1 2010 to 445 billion at december 31 2011 general electric capital corporation gecc is a diversely funded and smaller more focused finance company with strong positions in several commercial midmarket and consumer financing segments 

overall acquisitions contributed 46 billion 03 billion and 29 billion to consolidated revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding the effects of acquisition gains following our adoption of an amendment to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 810 consolidation  our consolidated net earnings included an insignificant amount 01 billion and 05 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively from acquired businesses we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible only revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth following quarter are attributed to such businesses dispositions also affected our ongoing results through lower revenues of 126 billion 30 billion and 47 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the effects of dispositions on net earnings was a decrease of 03 billion in 2011 and increases of 01 billion and 06 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

discontinued operations consistent with our goal of reducing gecc eni and focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge broad distribution and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk in 2011 we sold consumer rv marine consumer mexico consumer singapore and australian home lending discontinued operations also includes bac credomatic gecf inc bac our us mortgage business wmc and ge money japan our japanese personal loan business lake and our japanese mortgage and card businesses excluding our investment in ge nissen credit co ltd all of these operations were previously reported in the ge capital segment 

we reported the operations described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented for further information about discontinued operations see “segment operations – discontinued operations” in this item and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

we declared 75 billion in dividends in 2011 common pershare dividends of 061 increased 33 from 2010 following a 25 decrease from the preceding year in february 2009 we announced the reduction of the quarterly ge stock dividend by 68 from 031 per share to 010 per share effective with the dividend approved by the board in june 2009 which was paid in the third quarter of 2009 in july 2010 our board of directors approved a 20 increase in our regular quarterly dividend from 010 per share to 012 per share and in december 2010 approved an additional 17 increase from 012 per share to 014 per share on april 21 2011 our board of directors approved an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to 015 per share on december 9 2011 our board of directors approved an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to 017 per share on february 10 2012 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 017 per share of common stock which is payable april 25 2012 to shareowners of record at close of business on february 27 2012 in 2011 2010 and 2009 we declared 10 billion including 08 billion as a result of our redemption of preferred stock 03 billion and 03 billion in preferred stock dividends respectively see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for additional information 

except as otherwise noted the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of ge with gecs included on a oneline basis and gecs see the segment operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within ge and gecs 

significant matters relating to our statement of earnings are explained below

ge sales of product services were 419 billion in 2011 an increase of 14 compared with 2010 and operating profit from product services was 118 billion in 2011 an increase of 15 compared with 2010 both the sales and operating profit of product services increases were at energy infrastructure aviation transportation and healthcare 

postretirement benefit plans costs were 41 billion 30 billion and 26 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively costs increased in 2011 primarily due to the continued amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 578 at december 31 2009 to 528 at december 31 2010 costs increased in 2010 primarily due to the amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 611 at december 31 2008 to 578 at december 31 2009 partially offset by lower early retirement costs 

our discount rate for our principal pension plans at december 31 2011 was 421 which reflected current historically low interest rates considering the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 80 for cost recognition in 2012 compared to 80 in 2011 and 85 in both 2010 and 2009 gaap provides recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees see the critical accounting estimates section for additional information 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits to increase in 2012 by approximately 13 billion as compared to 2011 primarily because of the effects of additional 2008 investment loss amortization and lower discount rates 

pension expense for our principal pension plans on a gaap basis was 24 billion 11 billion and 05 billion for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively operating pension costs nongaap for these plans were 14 billion in both 2011 and 2010 and 20 billion in 2009 operating earnings include service cost and plan amendment amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee benefits earned operating earnings exclude nonoperating pension costincome such as interest cost expected return on plan assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses we expect operating pension costs for these plans will be about 17 billion in 2012 

the ge pension plan was underfunded by 132 billion at the end of 2011 as compared to 28 billion at december 31 2010 the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligations of 52 billion and 44 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in underfunding from yearend 2010 was primarily attributable to the effects of lower discount rates and lower investment returns our principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 528 at december 31 2010 to 421 at december 31 2011 which increased the pension benefit obligation at yearend 2011 by approximately 74 billion a 100 basis point increase in our pension discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation at yearend by approximately 70 billion our ge pension plan assets decreased from 448 billion at the end of 2010 to 421 billion at december 31 2011 primarily driven by benefit payments made during the year which were partially offset by investment returns assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations 

on an employee retirement income security act erisa basis the ge pension plan was 92 funded at january 1 2012 we will contribute approximately 10 billion to the ge pension plan in 2012 funding requirements are determined as prescribed by erisa and for ge are based on the plan’s funded status as of the beginning of the previous year and future contributions may vary based on actual plan results assuming our 2012 actual experience is consistent with our current benefit assumptions eg expected return on assets and interest rates we expect to make about 21 billion in contributions to the ge pension plan in 2013 

  

29 

  

at december 31 2011 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 33 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2010 was 21 billion we expect to contribute 07 billion to our other pension plans in 2012 compared with actual contributions of 07 billion and 06 billion in 2011 and 2010 respectively we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was 121 billion and 109 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to the effects of lower discount rates retiree health and life plans discount rate decreased from 515 at december 31 2010 to 409 at december 31 2011 partially offset by lower cost trends we expect to contribute 06 billion to these plans in 2012 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion in both 2011 and 2010 

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses these costs were 185 163 and 143 of total ge sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the vast majority of this 2011 increase was driven by higher pension costs and increased research and development spending the increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher research and development spending increased selling expenses to support global growth and higher pension costs partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges 

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 145 billion 156 billion and 177 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 139 billion 145 billion and 169 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively gecs average borrowings declined from 2010 to 2011 and from 2009 to 2010 in line with changes in average gecs assets interest rates have decreased over the threeyear period primarily attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates gecs average borrowings were 4532 billion 4726 billion and 4849 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the gecs average composite effective interest rate was 31 in 2011 31 in 2010 and 35 in 2009 in 2011 gecs average assets of 5929 billion were 3 lower than in 2010 which in turn were 3 lower than in 2009 see the liquidity and borrowings section for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax rates are also affected by tax incentives introduced in the us and other countries to encourage and support certain types of activity our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge 

our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures and our 2009 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us there is a benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because ge funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

income taxes benefit on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 285 in 2011 compared with 73 in 2010 and 116 in 2009 

  

30 

  

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

our benefits from lower taxed global operations declined to 21 billion in 2011 from 28 billion in 2010 and from 39 billion in 2009 principally because of lower earnings in our operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and from losses for which there was not a full tax benefit these decreases also reflected management’s decision in 2009 to indefinitely reinvest prior year earnings outside the us the benefit from lower taxed global operations increased in 2011 by 01 billion and in 2010 by 04 billion due to audit resolutions to the extent global interest rates and nonus operating income increase we would expect tax benefits to increase subject to management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings 

our benefit from lower taxed global operations included the effect of the lower foreign tax rate on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which provided a tax benefit of 15 billion in 2011 20 billion in 2010 and 30 billion in 2009 the tax benefit from nonus income taxed at a local country rather than the us statutory tax rate is reported in the effective tax rate reconciliation in the line “tax on global earnings including exports” 

the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011 was due in significant part to the high effective tax rate on the pretax gain on the nbc universal nbcu transaction with comcast corporation comcast discussed in note 2 this gain increased the consolidated effective tax rate by 129 percentage points the effective tax rate was also higher because of the increase in 2011 of income in higher taxed jurisdictions this decreased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations in addition the consolidated income tax rate increased from 2010 to 2011 due to the decrease discussed above in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations and the lower benefit from audit resolutions 

cash income taxes paid in 2011 were 29 billion reflecting the effects of changes to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and the timing of tax payments to governments 

our consolidated income tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily because of an increase during 2010 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this decreased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations in addition the consolidated income tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 due to the decrease discussed above in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations these effects were partially offset by an increase in the benefit from audit resolutions primarily a decrease in the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits from the completion of our 20032005 audit with the internal revenue service irs 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecs and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecs net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecs earnings from continuing operations were 126 billion 120 billion and 126 billion for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 383 in 2011 168 in 2010 and 218 in 2009 

  

31 

  

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

the ge effective tax rate increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily because of the high effective tax rate on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast reflecting the low tax basis in our investments in the nbcu business and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to our 49 investment in nbcuniversal llc nbcu llc see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this gain increased the ge effective tax rate by 197 percentage points in addition the effective tax rate increased because of the 26 percentage point decrease in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2009 to 2010 primarily because of the 40 percentage point increase in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

the gecs effective income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a tax benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because gecs funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

as noted above ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecs effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return ge makes cash payments to gecs for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due the effect of gecs on the amount of the consolidated tax liability from the formation of the nbcu joint venture will be settled in cash when gecs tax deductions and credits otherwise would have reduced the liability of the group absent the tax on joint venture formation 

  

32 

  

the gecs effective tax rate was 120 in 2011 compared with 484 in 2010 and 1443 in 2009 comparing a tax benefit to pretax income resulted in a negative tax rate in 2010 comparing a tax benefit to a pretax loss results in the positive tax rate in 2009 the gecs tax expense of 09 billion in 2011 increased by 19 billion from a 10 billion benefit in 2010 the higher 2011 tax expense resulted principally from higher pretax income in 2011 than in 2010 which increased pretax income 54 billion and increased the expense 19 billion also increasing the expense was a benefit from resolution of the 20062007 irs audit 02 billion that was less than the benefit from resolution of the 20032005 irs audit 03 billion both of which are reported in the caption “all othernet” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

the gecs tax benefit of 39 billion in 2009 decreased by 29 billion to 10 billion in 2010 the lower 2010 tax benefit resulted in large part from the change from a pretax loss in 2009 to pretax income in 2010 which increased pretax income 47 billion and decreased the benefit 17 billion the nonrepeat of the onetime benefit related to the 2009 decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest undistributed prior year nonus earnings 07 billion and a decrease in lowertaxed global operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 06 billion caused in part by an increase in losses for which there was not a full tax benefit including an increase in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to the 2008 loss on the sale of ge money japan 02 billion these lower benefits were partially offset by the benefit from the resolution of the 20032005 irs audit 03 billion 

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization like ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated we evaluate risk at the individual transaction level and evaluate aggregated risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

risk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of management the ge board of directors board has oversight for risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company including strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks at the end of each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to prioritize in the next year throughout the year the board and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail strategic operational and reputational risks are presented and discussed in the context of the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings and at presentations to the board and its committees by the vice chairmen chief risk officer cro general counsel and other employees the board has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific risks to board committees as follows 

  

33 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the ge board’s risk oversight process builds upon management’s risk assessment and mitigation processes which include standardized reviews of longterm strategic and operational planning executive development and evaluation code of conduct compliance under the company’s the spirit  the letter regulatory compliance health safety and environmental compliance financial reporting and controllership and information technology and security ge’s cro is responsible for overseeing and coordinating risk assessment and mitigation on an enterprisewide basis the cro leads the corporate risk function and is responsible for the identification of key business risks providing for appropriate management of these risks within ge board guidelines and enforcement through policies and procedures management has two committees to further assist it in assessing and mitigating risk the corporate risk committee crc meets periodically is chaired by the cro and comprises the chairman and ceo vice chairmen general counsel and other senior level business and functional leaders it has principal responsibility for evaluating and addressing risks escalated to the cro and corporate risk function the policy compliance review board met 15 times in 2011 is chaired by the company’s general counsel and includes the chief financial officer and other senior level functional leaders it has principal responsibility for monitoring compliance matters across the company 

ges corporate risk function leverages the risk infrastructures in each of our businesses which have adopted an approach that corresponds to the company’s overall risk policies guidelines and review mechanisms our risk infrastructure operates at the business and functional level and is designed to identify evaluate and mitigate risks within each of the following categories 

 

 

 

 

  

34 

  

 

 

 

risks identified through our risk management processes are prioritized and depending on the probability and severity of the risk escalated to the cro the cro in coordination with the crc assigns responsibility for the risks to the business or functional leader most suited to manage the risk assigned owners are required to continually monitor evaluate and report on risks for which they bear responsibility enterprise risk leaders within each business and corporate function are responsible to present to the cro and crc risk assessments and key risks at least annually we have general response strategies for managing risks which categorize risks according to whether the company will avoid transfer reduce or accept the risk these response strategies are tailored to ensure that risks are within acceptable ge board general guidelines 

depending on the nature of the risk involved and the particular business or function affected we use a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies including delegation of authorities standardized processes and strategic planning reviews operating reviews insurance and hedging as a matter of policy we generally hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our service businesses employ a comprehensive tollgate process leading up to and through the execution of a contractual service agreement to mitigate legal financial and operational risks furthermore we centrally manage some risks by purchasing insurance the amount of which is determined by balancing the level of risk retained or assumed with the cost of transferring risk to others we manage the risk of fluctuations in economic activity and customer demand by monitoring industry dynamics and responding accordingly including by adjusting capacity implementing cost reductions and engaging in mergers acquisitions and dispositions 

ge capital risk management and oversight 

 

ge capital has a robust risk infrastructure and robust processes to manage risks related to its businesses and the ge corporate risk function relies upon them in fulfilling its mission 

the ge risk committee was established to oversee ge capital’s risk appetite risk assessment and management processes previously undertaken by the ge audit committee the gecc board of directors oversees the ge capital risk management framework and approves all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as significant borrowings and investments the gecc board of directors exercises control over investment activities in the business units through delegations of authority all participants in the ge capital risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the gecc board 

the enterprise risk management committee ermc which comprises the most senior leaders in ge capital as well as the ge cro oversees the implementation of the ge capital’s risk appetite and senior management’s establishment of appropriate systems including policies procedures and management committees to ensure enterprise risks are effectively identified measured monitored and controlled day to day risk oversight for ge capital is provided by an independent global risk management organization which includes the ge capital corporate function in addition to risk officers embedded in the individual business units the risk leaders in the business units have dual reporting relationships reporting both into the local business management and also to the ge capital corporatelevel function leader which further strengthens their independence 

  

35 

  

ge capital’s risk management approach rests upon three major tenets a broad spread of risk based on managed exposure limits senior secured commercial financings and a holdtomaturity model with transactions underwritten to “onbook” standards dedicated risk professionals across the businesses include underwriters portfolio managers collectors environmental or engineering specialists and specialized asset managers the senior risk officers have on average over 25 years of experience 

ge capital manages risk categories identified in ge capital’s business environment which if materialized could prevent ge capital from achieving its risk objectives andor result in losses these risks are defined as ge capital’s enterprise risk universe which includes the following risks strategic including earnings and capital liquidity credit market and operational including financial compliance information technology human resources and legal reputational risk is considered and managed across each of the categories ge capital has made significant investments in resources to enhance its risk management infrastructure in particular with regard to compliance market and operational risk liquidity and capital management 

ge capital’s corporate risk function in consultation with the ermc updates the enterprise risk appetite statement annually this document articulates the enterprise risk objectives its key universe of risks and the supporting limit structure ge capital’s risk appetite is determined relative to its desired risk objectives including but not limited to credit ratings capital levels liquidity management regulatory assessments earnings dividends and compliance ge capital determines its risk appetite through consideration of portfolio analytics including stress testing and economic capital measurement experience and judgment of senior risk officers current portfolio levels strategic planning and regulatory and rating agency expectations 

the enterprise risk appetite is presented to the gecc board and the ge risk committee for review and approval at least annually on a quarterly basis the status of ge capital’s performance against these limits is reviewed by the ge risk committee 

ge capital acknowledges risktaking as a fundamental characteristic of providing financial services it is inherent to its business and arises in lending leasing and investment transactions undertaken by ge capital ge capital utilizes its risk capacity judiciously in pursuit of its strategic goals and risk objectives 

ge capital uses stress testing for risk liquidity and capital adequacy assessment and management purposes and as an integral part of ge capital’s overall planning processes stress testing results inform key strategic portfolio decisions such as capital allocation assist in developing the risk appetite and limits and help in assessing product specific risk to guide the development and modification of product structures the ermc approves the highlevel scenarios for and reviews the results of ge capitalwide stress tests across key risk areas such as credit and investment liquidity and market risk stress test results are also expressed in terms of impact to capital levels and metrics and that information is reviewed with the gecc board and the ge risk committee at least twice a year stress testing requirements are set forth in ge capital’s approved risk policies key policies such as the enterprise risk management policy the enterprise risk appetite statement and the liquidity and capital management policies are approved by the gecc board and the ge risk committee at least annually ge capital in coordination with and under the oversight of the ge cro provides risk reports to the ge risk committee at these meetings which occur at least four times a year ge capital senior management focuses on the risk strategy and the risk oversight processes used to manage the elements of risk managed by the ermc 

operational risks are inherent in ge capital’s business activities and are typical of any large enterprise ge capital’s operational risk management program seeks to effectively manage operational risk to reduce the potential for significant unexpected losses and to minimize the impact of losses experienced in the normal course of business 

additional information about our liquidity and how we manage this risk can be found in the financial resources and liquidity section additional information about our credit risk and gecs portfolio can be found in the financial resources and liquidity and critical accounting estimates sections additional information about our market risk and how we manage this risk can be found in the financial resources and liquidity section

segment operations 

effective january 1 2011 we reorganized the former technology infrastructure segment into three segments – aviation healthcare and transportation the priorperiod results of the aviation healthcare and transportation businesses are unaffected by this reorganization results of our formerly consolidated subsidiary nbcu and our current equity method investment in nbcu llc are reported in the corporate items and eliminations line on the summary of operating segments 

our six segments are focused on the broad markets they serve energy infrastructure aviation healthcare transportation home  business solutions and ge capital in addition to providing information on segments in their entirety we have also provided supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments for greater clarity 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses inprocess research and development and certain other acquisitionrelated charges and balances technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team 

  

segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for energy infrastructure aviation healthcare transportation and home  business solutions included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for ge capital prior to january 1 2011 segment profit excluded the effects of principal pension plans beginning january 1 2011 we began allocating service costs related to our principal pension plans and no longer allocate the retiree costs of our postretirement healthcare benefits to our segments this revised allocation methodology better aligns segment operating costs to the active employee costs which are managed by the segments this change does not significantly affect reported segment results

geographic operations 

 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new profit opportunities new profit opportunities include among other things more opportunities for expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis the us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas we classify certain operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose 

 

global revenues increased 4 to 775 billion in 2011 compared with 745 billion and 786 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 53 in 2011 compared with 50 in 2010 and 51 in 2009 the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results increased revenues by 25 billion in 2011 increased revenues by 05 billion in 2010 and decreased revenues by 39 billion in 2009

ge global revenues excluding gecs in 2011 were 543 billion up 9 over 2010 increases in growth markets of 29 in latin america 28 in china and 46 in australia more than offset decreases of 12 in western europe these revenues as a percentage of ge total revenues excluding gecs were 55 in 2011 compared with 50 and 52 in 2010 and 2009 respectively ge global revenues excluding gecs were 498 billion in 2010 down 6 from 2009 primarily resulting from decreases in europe middle east and africa partially offset by an increase in latin america 

gecs global revenues decreased 6 to 232 billion in 2011 compared with 247 billion and 257 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively primarily as a result of decreases in western europe gecs global revenues as a percentage of total gecs revenues were 47 in 2011 compared with 50 in both 2010 and 2009 gecs global revenue decreased by 4 in 2010 from 257 billion in 2009 primarily as a result of decreases in europe partially offset by an increase in australia 

 

 

total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were 3804 billion in 2011 a decrease of 322 billion or 8 from 2010 gecs global assets on a continuing basis of 3193 billion at the end of 2011 were 1 lower than at the end of 2010 reflecting declines in europe primarily due to dispositions and portfolio runoff in various businesses at consumer and lower financing receivables and equipment leased to others at cll 

financial results of our global activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 03 billion in 2011 02 billion in 2010 and 03 billion in 2009 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about 04 billion for each of the next two years 

in 2006 we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency epa to dredge pcbcontaining sediment from the upper hudson river the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009 between phase 1 and phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts the panel evaluated the performance of phase 1 dredging operations with respect to phase 1 engineering performance standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards on december 17 2010 epa issued its decision setting forth the final performance standards for phase 2 of the hudson river dredging project incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from ge in december 2010 we agreed to perform phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by epa and increased our reserve by 08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 to account for the probable and estimable costs of completing phase 2 in 

  

46 

  

2011 we completed the first year of phase 2 dredging and commenced work on planned upgrades to the hudson river wastewater processing facility based on the results from 2011 dredging and our best professional engineering judgment we believe that our current reserve continues to reflect our probable and estimable costs for the remainder of phase 2 of the dredging project 

financial resources and liquidity 

 

this discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the statement of financial position liquidity and borrowings debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity the statement of cash flows contractual obligations and variable interest entities 

overview of financial position 

 

major changes to our shareowners’ equity are discussed in the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity section in addition other significant changes to balances in our statement of financial position follow 

statement of financial position 

 

because ge and gecs share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position – property plant and equipment and borrowings for example – the following discussion addresses significant captions in the “consolidated” statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecs activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

investment securities comprise mainly investment grade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants policyholders and holders of guaranteed investment contracts gics in our runoff insurance operations and trinity and investment securities at our treasury operations and investments held in our cll business collateralized by senior secured loans of highquality middlemarket companies in a variety of industries the fair value of investment securities increased to 474 billion at december 31 2011 from 439 billion at december 31 2010 of the amount at december 31 2011 we held debt securities with an estimated fair value of 463 billion which included corporate debt securities assetbacked securities abs residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs with estimated fair values of 261 billion 50 billion 26 billion and 28 billion respectively net unrealized gains on debt securities were 30 billion and 06 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively this amount included unrealized losses on corporate debt securities abs rmbs and cmbs of 06 billion 02 billion 03 billion and 02 billion respectively at december 31 2011 as compared with 04 billion 02 billion 04 billion and 02 billion respectively at december 31 2010 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria we presently do not intend to sell the vast majority of our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost we believe that the unrealized loss associated with our equity securities will be recovered within the foreseeable future 

our rmbs portfolio is collateralized primarily by pools of individual direct mortgage loans a majority of which were originated in 2006 and 2005 not other structured products such as collateralized debt obligations substantially all of our rmbs are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals and more than 75 are agency bonds or insured by monoline insurers on which we continue to place reliance of our total rmbs portfolio at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 approximately 05 billion and 07 billion respectively relate to residential subprime credit primarily supporting our guaranteed investment contracts a majority of exposure to residential subprime credit related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 substantially all of the subprime rmbs were investment grade at the time of purchase and approximately 70 have been subsequently downgraded to below investment grade 

our cmbs portfolio is collateralized by both diversified pools of mortgages that were originated for securitization conduit cmbs and pools of large loans backed by high quality properties large loan cmbs a majority of which were originated in 2007 and 2006 substantially all of the securities in our cmbs portfolio have investment grade credit ratings and the vast majority of the securities are in a senior position in the capital structure

our abs portfolio is collateralized by senior secured loans of highquality middlemarket companies in a variety of industries as well as a variety of diversified pools of assets such as student loans and credit cards the vast majority of our abs are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals in addition substantially all of the securities that are below investment grade are in an unrealized gain position 

if there has been an adverse change in cash flows for rmbs management considers credit enhancements such as monoline insurance which are features of a specific security in evaluating the overall creditworthiness of the monoline insurer monoline we use an analysis that is similar to the approach we use for corporate bonds including an evaluation of the sufficiency of the monoline’s cash reserves and capital ratings activity whether the monoline is in default or default appears imminent and the potential for intervention by an insurance or other regulator 

monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities primarily rmbs and municipal securities the credit enhancement is a feature of each specific security that guarantees the payment of all contractual cash flows and is not purchased separately by ge the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities we continue to rely on monolines with adequate capital and claims paying resources we have reduced our reliance on monolines that do not have adequate capital or have experienced regulator intervention at december 31 2011 our investment securities insured by monolines on which we continue to place reliance were 16 billion including 03 billion of our 05 billion investment in subprime rmbs at december 31 2011 the unrealized loss associated with securities subject to monoline credit enhancement for which there is an expected credit loss was 03 billion 

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during 2011 were 05 billion of which 04 billion was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on nonus government and nonus corporate securities and otherthantemporary losses on equity securities and 01 billion primarily relates to noncredit related losses on rmbs and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income 

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during 2010 were 05 billion of which 03 billion was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on rmbs nonus government securities nonus corporate securities and otherthantemporary losses on equity securities and 02 billion primarily relates to noncredit related losses on rmbs and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income 

our qualitative review attempts to identify issuers’ securities that are “atrisk” of otherthantemporary impairment that is for securities that we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of our amortized cost whether there is a possibility of credit loss that would result in an otherthantemporary impairment recognition in the following 12 months securities we have identified as “atrisk” primarily relate to investments in rmbs and nonus corporate debt securities across a broad range of industries the amount of associated unrealized loss on these securities at december 31 2011 is 06 billion unrealized losses are not indicative of the amount of credit loss that would be recognized as credit losses are determined based on adverse changes in expected cash flows rather than fair value for further information relating to how credit losses are calculated see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments 

at both december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 unrealized losses on investment securities totaled 16 billion including 12 billion aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2011 and 13 billion aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2010 of the amount aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2011 more than 70 are debt securities that were considered to be investment grade by the major rating agencies in addition of the amount aged 12 months or longer 07 billion and 03 billion related to structured securities mortgagebacked assetbacked and securitization retained interests and corporate debt securities respectively with respect to our investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2011 the majority relate to debt securities held to support obligations to holders of gics we presently do not intend to sell the vast majority of our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

fair value measurements  for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date additional information about our application of this guidance is provided in notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report at december 31 2011 the aggregate amount of investments that are measured at fair value through earnings totaled 59 billion and consisted primarily of various assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business as well as equity investments 

working capital  representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections increased 16 billion at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 due to increases in receivables and inventory and lower progress collections partially offset by increased accounts payable as energy infrastructure and aviation deliver units out of their backlogs over the next few years progress collections of 113 billion at december 31 2011 will be earned which along with progress collections on new orders will impact working capital throughout the last five years we have executed a significant number of initiatives through our operating council such as lean cycle time projects which have resulted in a more efficient use of working capital the operating council meets at least eight times per year and is led by our chairman we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

current receivables for ge totaled to 118 billion at the end of 2011 and 104 billion at the end of 2010 and included 90 billion due from customers at the end of 2011 compared with 81 billion at the end of 2010 ge current receivables turnover was 83 in 2011 compared with 86 in 2010 the overall increase in current receivables was primarily due to the higher volume and acquisitions at energy infrastructure 11 billion 

inventories for ge totaled to 137 billion at december 31 2011 up 23 billion from the end of 2010 this increase reflected higher inventories at energy infrastructure partially due to acquisitions 10 billion aviation and transportation ge inventory turnover was 70 and 72 in 2011 and 2010 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows 

our consumer portfolio is largely nonus and primarily comprises mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries our us consumer financing receivables comprise 16 of our total portfolio of those approximately 65 relate primarily to credit cards which are often subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements with the retailer the results of which are reflected in revenues and have a smaller average balance and lower loss severity as compared to bank cards the remaining 35 are sales finance receivables which provide electronics recreation medical and home improvement financing to customers in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans 

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes which for our cll business primarily include industrialrelated facilities and equipment vehicles corporate aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation media communications entertainment and healthcare industries the portfolios in our real estate gecas and energy financial services businesses are collateralized by commercial real estate commercial aircraft and operating assets in the global energy industry respectively we are in a secured position for substantially all of our commercial portfolio

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible to experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio as a result the allowance for losses is not carried over at acquisition this may have the effect of causing lower reserve coverage ratios for those portfolios 

for purposes of the discussion that follows “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection is otherwise doubtful nonearning receivables exclude loans purchased at a discount unless they have deteriorated post acquisition under fasb asc 310 receivables  these loans are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition in addition nonearning receivables exclude loans that are paying on a cash accounting basis but classified as nonaccrual and impaired “nonaccrual” financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms but may remain classified as nonaccrual until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 2957 billion at december 31 2011 and 3203 billion at december 31 2010 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 246 billion from december 31 2010 primarily as a result of collections exceeding originations 149 billion which includes sales writeoffs 72 billion and the stronger us dollar 15 billion partially offset by acquisitions 36 billion the 246 billion decline in financing receivables excludes financing receivables of 115 billion previously reported in discontinued operations or assets of businesses held for sale primarily nonus residential mortgages and nonus installment and revolving credit associated with 2011 business and portfolio dispositions see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

related nonearning receivables totaled 93 billion 31 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2011 compared with 115 billion 36 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2010 nonearning receivables decreased from december 31 2010 primarily due to writeoffs and discounted payoffs in real estate improved performance in commercial and improvements in our entry rates in consumer 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2011 totaled 64 billion compared with 80 billion at december 31 2010 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio allowance for losses decreased 17 billion from december 31 2010 primarily because provisions were lower than writeoffs net of recoveries by 15 billion which is attributable to a reduction in the overall financing receivables balance and an improvement in the overall credit environment the allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables decreased from 25 at december 31 2010 to 21 at december 31 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for losses as discussed above partially offset by a decline in the overall financing receivables balance as collections exceeded originations further information surrounding the allowance for losses related to each of our portfolios is detailed below

the following table provides information surrounding selected ratios related to nonearning financing receivables and the allowance for losses 

 

included below is a discussion of financing receivables allowance for losses nonearning receivables and related metrics for each of our significant portfolios 

cll − americas  nonearning receivables of 19 billion represented 200 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 501 at december 31 2010 to 477 at december 31 2011 reflecting an overall improvement in the credit quality of the remaining portfolio and an overall decrease in nonearning receivables the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 29 at december 31 2010 to 23 at december 31 2011 primarily due to reduced nonearning exposures in our healthcare media franchise and inventory financing portfolios which more than offset deterioration in our corporate aircraft portfolio collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables primarily includes assets in the restaurant and hospitality trucking and industrial equipment industries and corporate aircraft and for our leveraged finance business equity of the underlying businesses 

  

53 

  

cll – europe  nonearning receivables of 12 billion represented 125 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 346 at december 31 2010 to 343 at december 31 2011 primarily due to an increase in nonearning receivables in our senior secured lending portfolio partially offset by a reduction in nonearning receivables related to account restructuring in our assetbacked lending portfolio and improved delinquency in our equipment finance portfolio the majority of nonearning receivables are attributable to the interbanca spa portfolio which was acquired in 2009 the loans acquired with interbanca spa were recorded at fair value which incorporates an estimate at the acquisition date of credit losses over their remaining life accordingly these loans generally have a lower ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables compared to the remaining portfolio excluding the nonearning loans attributable to the 2009 acquisition of interbanca spa the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 657 at december 31 2010 to 559 at december 31 2011 for the reasons described above the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 33 at december 31 2010 to 32 at december 31 2011 as a result of a decrease in nonearning receivables across our equipment finance and assetbacked lending portfolios partially offset by the increase in nonearning receivables in our senior secured lending portfolio for the reasons described above collateral supporting these secured nonearning financing receivables are primarily equity of the underlying businesses for our senior secured lending and interbanca spa businesses and equipment for our equipment finance portfolio 

cll – asia  nonearning receivables of 03 billion represented 29 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 547 at december 31 2010 to 584 at december 31 2011 primarily as a result of collections and writeoffs of nonearning receivables in our assetbased financing businesses in japan australia and new zealand the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 34 at december 31 2010 to 23 at december 31 2011 primarily due to the decline in nonearning receivables related to our assetbased financing businesses in japan australia and new zealand partially offset by a lower financing receivables balance collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables is primarily commercial real estate manufacturing equipment corporate aircraft and assets in the auto industry 

real estate – debt  nonearning receivables of 05 billion represented 58 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the decrease in nonearning receivables from december 31 2010 was driven primarily by the resolution of us multifamily and office nonearning loans as well as european hotel and retail loans through restructurings payoffs and foreclosures partially offset by new european multifamily delinquencies the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 1344 to 1754 reflecting resolution of nonearning loans as mentioned above the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables decreased from 43 at december 31 2010 to 39 at december 31 2011 driven primarily by writeoffs related to settlements and payoffs from impaired loan borrowers and improvement in collateral values 

the real estate financing receivables portfolio is collateralized by incomeproducing or owneroccupied commercial properties across a variety of asset classes and markets at december 31 2011 total real estate financing receivables of 327 billion were primarily collateralized by owneroccupied properties 82 billion office buildings 72 billion apartment buildings 45 billion and hotel properties 38 billion in 2011 commercial real estate markets showed signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market and the long term outlook remains uncertain we have and continue to maintain an intense focus on operations and risk management loan loss reserves related to our real estate–debt financing receivables are particularly sensitive to declines in underlying property values assuming global property values decline an incremental 1 or 5 and that decline occurs evenly across geographies and asset classes we estimate incremental loan loss reserves would be required of less than 01 billion and approximately 02 billion respectively estimating the impact of global property values on loss performance across our portfolio depends on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions property level operating performance local market dynamics and individual borrower behavior as a result any sensitivity analyses or attempts to forecast potential losses carry a high degree of imprecision and are subject to change at december 31 2011 we had 119 foreclosed commercial real estate properties totaling 07 billion

consumer − nonus residential mortgages  nonearning receivables of 33 billion represented 360 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 215 at december 31 2010 to 211 at december 31 2011 in the year ended 2011 our nonearning receivables decreased primarily due to improving portfolio quality in the uk our nonus mortgage portfolio has a loantovalue ratio of approximately 75 at origination and the vast majority are first lien positions our uk and france portfolios which comprise a majority of our total mortgage portfolio have reindexed loantovalue ratios of 84 and 56 respectively about 4 of these loans are without mortgage insurance and have a reindexed loantovalue ratio equal to or greater than 100 loantovalue information is updated on a quarterly basis for a majority of our loans and considers economic factors such as the housing price index at december 31 2011 we had in repossession stock 461 houses in the uk which had a value of approximately 01 billion the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables remained constant at 93 at december 31 2011 

consumer − nonus installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 03 billion represented 28 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 3242 at december 31 2010 to 2726 at december 31 2011 reflecting the effects of loan repayments and reduced originations primarily in our european platforms 

consumer − us installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 10 billion represented 106 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2011 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 1943 at december 31 2010 to 2028 at december 31 2011 as a result of lower entry rates and improved collections resulting in reductions in our nonearning receivables balance the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percentage of financing receivables decreased from 27 at december 31 2010 to 21 at december 31 2011 primarily due to lower delinquencies reflecting an improvement in the overall credit environment 

nonaccrual financing receivables 

 

the following table provides details related to our nonaccrual and nonearning financing receivables nonaccrual financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due substantially all of the differences between nonearning and nonaccrual financing receivables relate to loans which are classified as nonaccrual financing receivables but are paying on a cash accounting basis and therefore excluded from nonearning receivables of our 170 billion nonaccrual loans at december 31 2011 75 billion are currently paying in accordance with their contractual terms

impaired loans 

“impaired” loans in the table below are defined as larger balance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement the vast majority of our consumer and a portion of our cll nonaccrual receivables are excluded from this definition as they represent smaller balance homogeneous loans that we evaluate collectively by portfolio for impairment 

impaired loans include nonearning receivables on larger balance or restructured loans loans that are currently paying interest under the cash basis but are excluded from the nonearning category and loans paying currently but which have been previously restructured 

specific reserves are recorded for individually impaired loans to the extent we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement certain loans classified as impaired may not require a reserve because we believe that we will ultimately collect the unpaid balance through collection or collateral repossession 

 

further information pertaining to loans classified as impaired and specific reserves is included in the table below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

we regularly review our real estate loans for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors such as debt service coverage and loantovalue ratios we classify real estate loans as impaired when the most recent valuation reflects a projected loantovalue ratio at maturity in excess of 100 even if the loan is currently paying in accordance with contractual terms 

of our 87 billion impaired loans at real estate at december 31 2011 79 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and are typically loans where the borrower has adequate debt service coverage to meet contractual interest obligations impaired loans at cll primarily represent senior secured lending positions

our impaired loan balance at december 31 2011 and 2010 classified by the method used to measure impairment was as follows 

 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for further information on collateral dependent loans and our valuation process 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions forbearance or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr and also as impaired changes to real estate’s loans primarily include maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions of our commercial loans meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances at december 31 2011 tdrs included in impaired loans were 137 billion primarily relating to real estate 70 billion cll 36 billion and consumer 29 billion 

real estate tdrs increased from 49 billion at december 31 2010 to 70 billion at december 31 2011 primarily driven by loans scheduled to mature during 2011 some of which were modified during 2011 and classified as tdrs upon modification for borrowers with demonstrated operating capabilities we work to restructure loans when the cash flow and projected value of the underlying collateral support repayment over the modified term we deem loan modifications to be tdrs when we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty and we do not receive adequate compensation in the form of an effective interest rate that is at current market rates of interest given the risk characteristics of the loan or other consideration that compensates us for the value of the concession for the year ended december 31 2011 we modified 40 billion of loans classified as tdrs substantially all in our debt portfolio changes to these loans primarily included maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral or covenant terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the limited liquidity and higher return requirements in the real estate market for loans with higher loantovalue ltv ratios has typically resulted in the conclusion that the modified terms are not at current market rates of interest even if the modified loans are expected to be fully recoverable we received the same or additional compensation in the form of rate increases and fees for the majority of these tdrs of our modifications classified as tdrs in the last twelve months 01 billion have subsequently experienced a payment default 

the substantial majority of the real estate tdrs have reserves determined based upon collateral value our specific reserves on real estate tdrs were 06 billion at december 31 2011 and 04 billion at december 31 2010 and were 84 and 89 respectively of real estate tdrs although we experienced an increase in tdrs over this period in many situations these loans did not require a specific reserve as collateral value adequately covered our recorded investment in the loan while these modified loans had adequate collateral coverage we were still required to complete our tdr classification evaluation on each of the modifications without regard to collateral adequacy 

  

57 

  

we utilize certain shortterm three months or less loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary financial difficulties in our consumer loan portfolio these loan modification programs are primarily concentrated in our nonus residential mortgage and nonus installment and revolving portfolios we sold our us residential mortgage business in 2007 and as such do not participate in the us governmentsponsored mortgage modification programs for the year ended december 31 2011 we provided shortterm modifications of approximately 10 billion of consumer loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties substantially all in our nonus residential mortgage credit card and personal loan portfolios which are not classified as tdrs for these modified loans we provided insignificant interest rate reductions and payment deferrals which were not part of the terms of the original contract we expect borrowers whose loans have been modified under these shortterm programs to continue to be able to meet their contractual obligations upon the conclusion of the shortterm modification in addition we have modified 20 billion of consumer loans for the year ended december 31 2011 which are classified as tdrs further information on consumer impaired loans is provided in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

we manage counterparty exposure including credit risk on an individual counterparty basis we place defined risk limits around each obligor and review our risk exposure on the basis of both the primary and parent obligor as well as the issuer of securities held as collateral these limits are adjusted on an ongoing basis based on our continuing assessment of the credit risk of the obligor or issuer in setting our counterparty risk limits we focus on high quality credits and diversification through spread of risk in an effort to actively manage our overall exposure we actively monitor each exposure against these limits and take appropriate action when we believe that risk limits have been exceeded or there are excess risk concentrations our collateral position and ability to work out problem accounts has historically mitigated our actual loss experience delinquency experience has been improving in our european commercial and consumer platforms in the aggregate and we actively monitor and take action to reduce exposures where appropriate uncertainties surrounding european markets could have an impact on the judgments and estimates used in determining the carrying value of these assets 

other gecs receivables totaled 134 billion at december 31 2011 and 129 billion at december 31 2010 and consisted primarily of amounts due from ge primarily related to material procurement programs of 35 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively insurance receivables nonfinancing customer receivables amounts due under operating leases amounts accrued from investment income tax receivables and various sundry items

gecs liquidity position is targeted to meet our obligations under both normal and stressed conditions gecs establishes a funding plan annually that is based on the projected asset size and cash needs of the company which over the past few years has included our strategy to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital gecs relies on a diversified source of funding including the unsecured term debt markets the global commercial paper markets deposits secured funding retail funding products bank borrowings and securitizations to fund its balance sheet in addition to cash generated through collection of principal interest and other payments on our existing portfolio of loans and leases to fund its operating and interest expense costs 

our 2012 gecs funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding shortterm borrowings including the current portion of its longterm debt 827 billion at december 31 2011 which includes 27 billion of alternative and other funding through issuance of longterm debt and reissuance of commercial paper cash on hand collections of financing receivables exceeding originations dispositions asset sales and deposits and other alternative sources of funding interest on borrowings is primarily repaid through interest earned on existing financing receivables during 2011 gecs earned interest income on financing receivables of 224 billion which more than offset interest expense of 139 billion 

we maintain a detailed liquidity policy for gecs which includes a requirement to maintain a contingency funding plan the liquidity policy defines gecs’ liquidity risk tolerance under different stress scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues we actively monitor gecs’ access to funding markets and its liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise 

gecs is a savings and loan holding company under us law and became subject to federal reserve board frb supervision on july 21 2011 the oneyear anniversary of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the frb has recently finalized a regulation that requires certain organizations it supervises to submit annual capital plans for review including institutions’ plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments the applicability and timing of this proposed regulation to gecs is not yet determined however the frb has indicated that it expects to extend these requirements to large savings and loan holding companies through separate rulemaking or by order we expect that gecs capital allocation planning will be subject to frb review which could affect the timing of the ge capital dividend to the parent 

actions taken to strengthen and maintain our liquidity are described in the following section 

liquidity sources 

 

we maintain liquidity sources that consist of cash and equivalents and a portfolio of highquality liquid investments liquidity portfolio and committed unused credit lines 

we have consolidated cash and equivalents of 845 billion at december 31 2011 which is available to meet our needs see statement of financial position at gecs about 9 billion is in regulated bank and insurance entities and is subject to regulatory restrictions most of ge’s cash is held outside the us and is available to fund operations and other growth of nonus subsidiaries it is also available to fund our needs in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax under current tax laws should ge or gecs determine to repatriate cash and equivalents held outside the us we may be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes less than 1 billion is held in restricted countries 

in addition to our 845 billion of cash and equivalents we have a centrallymanaged portfolio of highquality liquid investments with a fair value of 36 billion at december 31 2011 the liquidity portfolio is used to manage liquidity and meet the operating needs of gecs under both normal and stress scenarios the investments consist of unencumbered us government securities us agency securities securities guaranteed by the government supranational securities and a select group of nonus government securities we believe that we can readily obtain cash for these securities even in stressed market conditions 

  

61 

  

we have committed unused credit lines totaling 524 billion that have been extended to us by 58 financial institutions at december 31 2011 these lines include 351 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 167 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for one year from the date of expiration of the lending agreement 

at december 31 2011 our aggregate cash and equivalents and committed credit lines were more than twice gecs’ commercial paper borrowings balance 

funding plan 

 

we have reduced our ge capital ending net investment excluding cash and equivalents from 526 billion at january 1 2010 to 445 billion at december 31 2011 

in 2011 we completed issuances of 269 billion of senior unsecured debt and 20 billion of subordinated notes with maturities up to 25 years and subsequent to december 31 2011 an additional 116 billion average commercial paper borrowings for gecs and ge during the fourth quarter were 424 billion and 156 billion respectively and the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding for gecs and ge during the fourth quarter was 450 billion and 187 billion respectively gecs commercial paper maturities are funded principally through new issuances and at ge are substantially repaid by quarterend using overseas cash which is available for use in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax 

under the federal deposit insurance corporation’s fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp the fdic guaranteed certain senior unsecured debt issued by gecc on or before october 31 2009 for which we paid 23 billion of fees to the fdic for our participation our tlgpguaranteed debt has remaining maturities of 35 billion in 2012 we anticipate funding these and our other longterm debt maturities through a combination of existing cash new debt issuances collections exceeding originations dispositions asset sales deposits and other alternative sources of funding gecc and ge are parties to an eligible entity designation agreement and gecc is subject to the terms of a master agreement each entered into with the fdic the terms of these agreements include among other things a requirement that ge and gecc reimburse the fdic for any amounts that the fdic pays to holders of gecc debt that is guaranteed by the fdic 

we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding during 2011 we completed 118 billion of nonrecourse issuances and had maturities of 120 billion at december 31 2011 consolidated nonrecourse borrowings were 293 billion we anticipate that securitization will remain a part of our overall funding capabilities notwithstanding the changes in consolidation rules described in notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our issuances of securities repurchase agreements are insignificant and are limited to activities at certain of our foreign banks at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we were party to repurchase agreements totaling 01 billion and 02 billion respectively which were accounted for as onbook financings we have had no repurchase agreements which were not accounted for as financings and we do not engage in securities lending transactions 

we have deposittaking capability at 11 banks outside of the us and two banks in the us – ge capital retail bank formerly ge money bank a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit cds in maturity terms from three months to ten years 

total alternative funding at december 31 2011 was 66 billion composed mainly of 43 billion bank deposits 9 billion of funding secured by real estate aircraft and other collateral and 8 billion ge interest plus notes the comparable amount at december 31 2010 was 60 billion

preferred share redemption 

 

on october 16 2008 we issued 30000 shares of 10 cumulative perpetual preferred stock par value 100 per share having an aggregate liquidation value of 30 billion and warrants to purchase 134831460 shares of common stock par value 006 per share to berkshire hathaway inc berkshire hathaway for net proceeds of 30 billion in cash the proceeds were allocated to the preferred shares 25 billion and the warrants 05 billion on a relative fair value basis and recorded in other capital the warrants are exercisable for five years at an exercise price of 2225 per share of common stock and settled through physical share issuance 

 

the preferred stock was redeemable at our option three years after issuance at a price of 110 of liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid dividends on september 13 2011 we provided notice to berkshire hathaway that we would redeem the shares for the stated redemption price of 33 billion plus accrued and unpaid dividends in connection with this notice we recognized a preferred dividend of 08 billion calculated as the difference between the carrying value and redemption value of the preferred stock which was recorded as a reduction to our third quarter earnings attributable to common shareowners and common shareowners’ equity and a related eps charge of 008 as a result and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 we are no longer required to pay the preferred share dividends of 03 billion annually the preferred shares were redeemed on october 17 2011 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that seek to model the effects of shifts in rates such tests are inherently limited based on the assumptions used described further below and should not be viewed as a forecast actual effects would depend on many variables including market factors and the composition of the company’s assets and liability portfolio at that time

debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

principal debt and derivative conditions are described below 

 

certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings as of december 31 2011 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was “aa” with a stable outlook and from moody’s investors service “moody’s” was “aa2” with a stable outlook as of december 31 2011 ge gecs and gecc’s shortterm credit rating from sp was “a1” and from moody’s was “p1” we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings our ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 

fair values of our derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on among other factors market movements and changes in our positions we manage counterparty credit risk the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments to us according to the terms of our standard master agreements on an individual counterparty basis where we have agreed to netting of derivative exposures with a counterparty we offset our exposures with that counterparty and apply the value of collateral posted to us to determine the net exposure accordingly we actively monitor these net exposures against defined limits and take appropriate actions in response including requiring additional collateral 

swap forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the longterm credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below aa3 in certain of these master agreements the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the shortterm rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a1p1 the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be 12 billion at december 31 2011 see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

ratio of earnings to fixed charges income maintenance agreement and subordinated debentures 

 

on march 28 1991 ge entered into an agreement with gecc to make payments to gecc constituting additions to pretax income under the agreement to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc and consolidated affiliates determined on a consolidated basis to be not less than 1101 for the period as a single aggregation of each gecc fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991 gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1521 for 2011 no payment is required in 2012 pursuant to this agreement 

any payment made under the income maintenance agreement will not affect the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as determined in accordance with current sec rules because it does not constitute an addition to pretax income under current us gaap 

  

in addition in connection with certain subordinated debentures for which gecc receives equity credit by rating agencies ge has agreed to promptly return dividends distributions or other payments it receives from gecc during events of default or interest deferral periods under such subordinated debentures there were 72 billion of such debentures outstanding at december 31 2011 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity 

 

ge shareowners’ equity decreased by 25 billion in 2011 compared with an increase of 16 billion in 2010 and an increase of 126 billion in 2009 

net earnings increased ge shareowners equity by 142 billion 116 billion and 110 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 75 billion including 08 billion related to our preferred stock redemption 52 billion and 68 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

65 

  

elements of other comprehensive income oci decreased shareowners’ equity by 61 billion in 2011 and 23 billion in 2010 respectively compared with an increase of 66 billion in 2009 inclusive of changes in accounting principles the components of these changes are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement of cash flows – overview from 2009 through 2011 

 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 845 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 56 billion from december 31 2010 cash and equivalents totaled 789 billion at december 31 2010 an increase of 71 billion from december 31 2009 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets and deposits as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

  

66 

  

ge cash flow 

 

ge cash and equivalents were 84 billion at december 31 2011 compared with 192 billion at december 31 2010 ge cfoa totaled 121 billion in 2011 compared with 147 billion and 164 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively with respect to ge cfoa we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

ge cfoa decreased 27 billion compared with 2010 primarily due to the impact of the disposal of nbcu in 2010 ge cfoa decreased 17 billion compared with 2009 primarily reflecting a decrease in progress collections 

 

 

 

the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections decreased by 46 billion in 2011 and decreased by 59 billion in 2010 these changes are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues including the impact of the disposal of nbcu analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section are the best way of understanding their customerrelated cfoa 

 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services ge operating cash payments decreased in 2011 and 2010 by 20 billion and 42 billion respectively these changes are consistent with the changes in ge total costs and expenses including the impact of the disposal of nbcu 

dividends from gecs represented the distribution of a portion of gecs retained earnings and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses the amounts included in ge cfoa are the total dividends including normal dividends as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from gecs business sales beginning in the first quarter of 2009 gecs suspended its normal dividend to ge there were no special dividends received from gecs in 2011 2010 or 2009 

gecs cash flow 

 

gecs cash and equivalents were 767 billion at december 31 2011 compared with 603 billion at december 31 2010 gecs cash from operating activities totaled 211 billion for 2011 compared with cash from operating activities of 216 billion for the same period of 2010 this was primarily due to increases compared to the prior year in cash paid for income taxes of 07 billion and decreases in accrued expenses of 14 billion partially offset by increases in net cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 12 billion 

  

67 

  

consistent with our plan to reduce gecs asset levels cash from investing activities was 292 billion in 2011 resulting from a 144 billion reduction in financing receivables due to collections exceeding originations we received proceeds of 116 billion from sales of ge capital’s australian home lending operations 46 billion consumer businesses in mexico 19 billion canada 14 billion and singapore 07 billion consumer rv marine 18 billion our real estate interpark business 07 billion our cll marine container leasing business 04 billion and our cll trailer fleet services business in mexico 01 billion additionally we received proceeds of 44 billion from the sale of our equity method investments in garanti bank 38 billion and banco colpatria 06 billion these increases are partially offset by an increase in equipment purchases mainly at our gecas and cll businesses 

gecs cash used for financing activities in 2011 of 331 billion related primarily to a 378 billion reduction in total borrowings consisting primarily of reductions in longterm borrowings and commercial paper partially offset by an increase in deposits at our banks 

gecs pays dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales 

intercompany eliminations 

 

effects of transactions between related companies are made on an armslength basis are eliminated and consist primarily of gecs dividends to ge or capital contributions from ge to gecs ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs for further information related to intercompany eliminations see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2011 follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variable interest entities vies 

 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions 

the assets we securitize include receivables secured by equipment commercial real estate credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business the securitizations are funded with assetbacked commercial paper and term debt 

substantially all of our securitization vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement 

at december 31 2011 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 467 billion and 352 billion respectively a decrease of 41 billion and 31 billion from 2010 respectively assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our onbook assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

  

69 

  

at december 31 2011 investments in unconsolidated vies including our noncontrolling interest in ptl were 165 billion an increase of 39 billion from 2010 primarily related to an increase of 21 billion in an investment in assetbacked securities issued by a senior secured loan fund and 12 billion in ptl in addition to our existing investments we have contractual obligations to fund additional investments in the unconsolidated vies to fund new asset origination at december 31 2011 these contractual obligations were 43 billion a decrease of 07 billion from 2010 

we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred financing receivables to any vie in either 2011 or 2010 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates writeoffs in both our consumer and commercial portfolios can also reflect both losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of a fiscal year and information becoming available during that fiscal year which may identify further deterioration on exposures existing prior to the beginning of that fiscal year and for which reserves could not have been previously recognized our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments increased earnings by 04 billion in 2011 decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2010 and increased earnings by 02 billion in 2009 we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

further information is provided in notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria effective april 1 2009 the fasb amended asc 320 and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring otherthantemporary impairment for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use quoted market prices when available our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals as appropriate

our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in ge capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on managements best estimate in determining its best estimate management evaluates average current market values obtained from third parties of similar type and age aircraft which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 03 billion and 04 billion in 2011 and 2010 respectively provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were an insignificant amount for both 2011 and 2010 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 7 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments at least annually or more frequently as conditions warrant the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values based on the most recent valuation estimates available the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 26 billion commercial real estate valuations in 2011 showed signs of improved stability and liquidity in certain markets primarily in the us however the pace of improvement varies significantly by asset class and market accordingly there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon cash flow estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about capitalization rates and expected trends in rents and occupancy and is corroborated by external appraisals during 2011 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 12 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 23 billion in 2010 continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets results in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management and the all other assets sections of this item and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach when available and appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results for purposes of the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 90 to 1375 valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 

compared to the market approach the income approach more closely aligns each reporting unit valuation to our business profile including geographic markets served and product offerings required rates of return along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows are reflected in the selection of the discount rate equally important under this approach reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future states that may not be reflected in an observable market price a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples it can be somewhat more limited in its application because the population of potential comparables is often limited to publiclytraded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or nonpublic subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg synergies between the parties terms and conditions of the transaction etc may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business it can also be difficult under certain market conditions to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar businesses we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results if current conditions persist longer or deteriorate further than expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

  

73 

  

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense 

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 421 528 and 578 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future longterm return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we formulate views on the future economic environment both in the us and abroad we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth inflation valuations yields and spreads using both internal and external sources we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and expected allocations asset earnings in our principal pension plans were flat in 2011 and had average annual earnings of 47 67 and 87 per year in the 10 15 and 25year periods ended december 31 2011 respectively these average historical returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008 based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and expected asset allocations we have assumed an 80 longterm expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2012 compared to 80 in 2011 and 85 in both 2010 and 2009 

changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company at december 31 2011 and 2010 102 billion and 94 billion of earnings respectively have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations because of the availability of us foreign tax credits it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 48 billion and 44 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively including 09 billion and 10 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances associated with losses reported in discontinued operations primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan such yearend 2011 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation as applicable 

at december 31 2011 derivative assets and liabilities were 100 billion and 07 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 9 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and longlived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investments and longlived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs 

a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates

new accounting standards 

 

in june 2011 the fasb issued amendments to existing standards for reporting comprehensive income accounting standards update asu 201105 rescinds the requirement to present a consolidated statement of changes in share owners’ equity and introduces a new statement the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the new statement begins with net income and adds or deducts other recognized changes in assets and liabilities that are not included in net earnings under gaap for example unrealized changes in currency translation adjustments are included in the measure of comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings the amendments are effective for our first quarter 2012 financial statements the amendments affect only the display of those components of equity categorized as other comprehensive income and do not change existing recognition and measurement requirements that determine net earnings 

in may 2011 the fasb issued amendments to existing standards for fair value measurement and disclosure which are effective in the first quarter of 2012 the amendments clarify or change the application of existing fair value measurements including that the highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets that a reporting entity should measure the fair value of its own equity instrument from the perspective of a market participant that holds that instrument as an asset to permit an entity to measure the fair value of certain financial instruments on a net basis rather than based on its gross exposure when the reporting entity manages its financial instruments on the basis of such net exposure that in the absence of a level 1 input a reporting entity should apply premiums and discounts when market participants would do so when pricing the asset or liability consistent with the unit of account and that premiums and discounts related to size as a characteristic of the reporting entity’s holding are not permitted in a fair value measurement the impact of adopting these amendments is expected to be immaterial to the financial statements 

research and development 

 

gefunded research and development expenditures were 46 billion 39 billion and 33 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition research and development funding from customers principally the us government totaled 08 billion 10 billion and 11 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively aviation accounts for the largest share of ge’s research and development expenditures with funding from both ge and customer funds energy infrastructure’s energy business and healthcare also made significant expenditures funded primarily by ge

supplemental information 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this form 10k report to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

 

  

78 

  

we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as industrial cfoa which we define as ge’s cash from operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecs this includes the effects of intercompany transactions including ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge’s operating cash flows without the effect of gecs dividends since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services gecs cash flows we believe that our measure of industrial cfoa provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other nonfinancial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure

operating earnings excludes nonservice related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gainslosses the service cost and prior service cost components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings we believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees as such we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business other components of gaap pension cost are mainly driven by market performance and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses neither gaap nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan we also believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies we also believe that operating eps excluding the effects of the 08 billion preferred dividend related to the redemption of our preferred stock calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the redemption value of the preferred stock is a meaningful measure because it increases the comparability of periodtoperiod results 

 

 

  

80 

  

we have provided the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans operating pension costs comprise the service cost of benefits earned and prior service cost amortization for our principal pension plans nonoperating pension costs income comprise the expected return on plan assets interest cost on benefit obligations and net actuarial loss amortization for our principal pension plans we believe that the operating components of pension costs better reflects the ongoing servicerelated costs of providing pension benefits to our employees we believe that the operating and nonoperating components of cost for our principal pension plans considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our pension plan costs and operating results with the pension plan costs and operating results of other companies 

 

 

  

 

 

  

our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings our calculation of average ge shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary 

 

 

  

81 

  

we have provided the gecs ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents to reduce debt and with longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace certain longterm debt with equity in the first quarter of 2009 ge made a 95 billion payment to gecs of which 88 billion was further contributed to gecc through capital contribution and share issuance despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

we use eni to measure the size of our ge capital segment we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital debt or equity required to fund a business as it adjusts for noninterest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay we also believe that by excluding cash and equivalents we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our ge capital segment as a substantial amount of this cash and equivalents resulted from debt issuances to prefund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment 

 

 

  

82 

  

 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecs net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecs tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section and in the business descriptions in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report below we describe certain important operational and strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

our global growth is subject to economic and political risks 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world in 2010 approximately 53 of our revenue was attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of more volatile market conditions

we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that may change in significant ways 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright in particular us and nonus governments are undertaking a substantial review and revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and nonbank financial institutions consumer lending the overthecounter derivatives market and tax laws and regulations which may have an effect on ge capital’s structure operations liquidity and performance we are also subject to a number of trade control laws and regulations that may affect our ability to sell our products in global markets in addition we are subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local capital requirements that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with nonus banks and other nonus financial institutions in global markets this provision which expires at the end of 2011 has been scheduled to expire and has been extended by congress on six previous occasions including in december of 2010 but there can be no assurance that it will continue to be extended in the event the provision is not extended after 2011 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2012 in addition efforts by public and private sectors to control the growth of healthcare costs may lead to lower reimbursements and increased utilization controls related to the use of our products by healthcare providers increased government regulatory scrutiny of medical devices including reviews of the us food and drug administration us fda device premarket authorization process may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in us and international economic stimulus programs which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world we our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

the success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions dispositions and joint ventures 

with respect to acquisitions mergers and joint ventures we may not be able to identify suitable candidates at terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors including integration and collaboration challenges such as personnel and technology we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated even upon reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction 

sustained increases in costs of pension and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we used to estimate pension income or expense for 2011 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated gains losses – net benefit plans at the end of 2010 the ge pension plan was underfunded by 28 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 44 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees may increase future funding obligations although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability 

conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of ge capital funding 

a large portion of ge capital’s borrowings is in the form of commercial paper and longterm debt ge capital’s outstanding commercial paper and longterm debt was 37 billion and 350 billion as of december 31 2010 respectively we continue to rely on the availability of the unsecured debt markets to access funding for term maturities for 2011 and beyond in addition we rely on the availability of the commercial paper markets to refinance maturing commercial paper debt throughout the year in order to further diversify our funding sources we also plan to expand our reliance on alternative sources of funding including bank deposits securitizations and other assetbased funding there can be no assurance that we will succeed in diversifying our funding sources or that the short and longterm credit markets will be available or if available that the cost of funding will not substantially increase and affect the overall profitability of ge capital factors that may cause an increase in our funding costs include a decreased reliance on shortterm funding such as commercial paper in favor of longerterm funding arrangements decreased capacity and increased competition among debt issuers and increased competition for deposits in our affiliate banks’ markets if ge capital’s cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect its competitive position and result in lower lending margins earnings and cash flows as well as lower returns on its shareowner’s equity and invested capital

if conditions in the financial markets deteriorate it may adversely affect the business and results of operations of ge capital 

increased payment defaults and foreclosures and sustained levels of high unemployment have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including ge capital if these conditions continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets including goodwill intangibles and tax assets in addition although we   have established allowances for losses in ge capital’s portfolio of financing receivables that we believe are adequate further deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase these allowances and writeoffs which depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our   business  financial position and results of operations to reduce ge’s exposure to volatile conditions in the financial markets and rebalance the relative size of its financial and industrial businesses we decided to reduce the size of ge capital as measured by its ending net investment while we are currently ahead of our reduction targets there can be no assurance that we will be able to timely execute on our reduction targets and failure to do so would result in greater exposure to financial markets than contemplated under our strategic funding plan or may result in the need for us to make additional contributions to ge capital 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect ge capital 

ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the collateral held cannot be realized upon sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to initial credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which are designed to limit credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

the real estate markets in which ge capital participates are highly uncertain which may adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

ge capital participates in the commercial real estate market in two ways it provides financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties and it also acquires equity positions in various types of properties or real estate investments the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the economic conditions in specific geographic markets in which the properties are located and the perceived value of those markets at the time of sale the level of transactions for real estate assets continue to remain at levels below historical norms in many of the markets in which ge capital operates continued high levels of unemployment slowdown in business activity excess inventory capacity and limited availability of credit may continue to adversely affect the value of real estate assets and collateral to real estate loans ge capital holds under current market and credit conditions there can be no assurance as to the level of sales ge capital will complete or the net sales proceeds it will realize also occupancy rates and market rent levels may worsen which may result in impairments to the carrying value of equity investments or increases in the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans 

ge capital is also a residential mortgage lender in certain geographic markets outside the united states that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declines in real estate values and home sale volumes job losses consumer bankruptcies and other factors that may negatively impact the credit performance of our mortgage loans our allowance for loan losses on these mortgage loans is based on our analysis of current and historical delinquency and loan performance as well as other management assumptions that may be inaccurate predictions of credit performance in this environment there can be no assurance that in this environment credit performance will not be materially worse than anticipated and as a result materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting as of december 31 2010 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was “aa” the second highest of 22 rating categories with a stable outlook and from moody’s investors service “moody’s” was “aa2” the third highest of 21 rating categories with a stable outlook as of december 31 2010 ge ge capital services and ge capital’s shortterm credit rating from sp was “a1” the highest rating category of six categories and from moody’s was “p1” the highest rating category of four categories there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade which depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position 

current conditions in the global economy and the major industries we serve also may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our nonfinancial businesses 

the business and operating results of our technology infrastructure energy infrastructure home and business solutions and media businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions including conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare media home building and other major industries we serve as a result of slower global economic growth the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence increased unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures fluctuating commodity prices bankruptcies and other challenges affect the global economy some of our customers have experienced deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion in particular the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and international economies an extended period of slow growth in the us or internationally that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers and the viability of their business service contract cancellations could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if slower growth in the global economy continues for a significant period or there is significant deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

increased it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

we may face quality problems from operational failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations and we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth 

we produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services for both our and thirdparty products that incorporate or use leadingedge technology including both hardware and software while we have built extensive operational processes to ensure that the design manufacture and servicing of such products meet the most rigorous quality standards there can be no assurance that we or our customers will not experience operational process failures that could result in potential product safety regulatory or environmental risks such operational failures or 

  

19 

quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and results of operations in addition the markets in which we operate are subject to technological change our longterm operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative products to modify existing products to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 

our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours 

our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we could also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming if ge is found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms 

significant raw material shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials parts components systems and services a disruption in deliveries from our thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers or service providers capacity constraints production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs quality issues experienced by thirdparty providers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

operations 

our consolidated financial statements combine the industrial manufacturing services and media businesses of general electric company ge with the financial services businesses of general electric capital services inc gecs or financial services 

in the accompanying analysis of financial information we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission sec rules for such measures we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in the supplemental information section 

we present management’s discussion of operations in five parts overview of our earnings from 2008 through 2010 global risk management segment operations geographic operations and environmental matters unless otherwise indicated we refer to captions such as revenues and earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company simply as “revenues” and “earnings” throughout this management’s discussion and analysis similarly discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

effective january 1 2010 we reorganized our segments to better align our consumer  industrial and energy businesses for growth as a result of this reorganization we created a new segment called home  business solutions that includes the appliances and lighting businesses from our previous consumer  industrial segment and the retained portion of the ge fanuc intelligent platforms business of our previous enterprise solutions business formerly within our technology infrastructure segment in addition the industrial business of our previous consumer  industrial segment and the sensing  inspection technologies and digital energy businesses of our previous enterprise solutions business are now part of the energy business within the energy infrastructure segment the security business of enterprise solutions was reported in corporate items and eliminations until its sale in february 2010 also effective january 1 2010 the capital finance segment was renamed ge capital and includes all of the continuing operations of general electric capital corporation gecc in addition the transportation financial services business previously reported in ge capital aviation services gecas is included in commercial lending and leasing cll and our consumer business in italy previously reported in consumer is included in cll 

effective january 1 2011 we reorganized the technology infrastructure segment into three segments – aviation healthcare and transportation the results of the aviation healthcare and transportation businesses are unaffected by this reorganization and we will begin reporting these as separate segments beginning with our quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended march 31 2011 results for 2010 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which we managed our businesses in 2010 and do not reflect the january 2011 reorganization 

beginning in 2011 we will supplement our gaap net earnings and earnings per share eps reporting by also reporting an operating earnings and eps measure nongaap operating earnings and eps will include service cost and plan amendment amortization for our principal pension plans as these costs represent expenses associated with employee benefits earned operating earnings and eps will exclude nonoperating pension costincome such as interest cost expected return on plans assets and noncash amortization of actuarial gains and losses we believe that this reporting will provide better transparency to the employee benefit costs of our principal pension plans and company operating results

overview of our earnings from 2008 through 2010 

earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company increased 15 in 2010 after decreasing 39 in 2009 reflecting the stabilization of overall economic conditions during 2010 following the challenging conditions of the last two years and the effect on both our industrial and financial services businesses we believe that we are seeing signs of stabilization in the global economy including in financial services as gecs earnings from continuing operations attributable to the company increased 138 in 2010 compared with a decrease of 83 in 2009 net earnings attributable to the company increased 6 in 2010 after decreasing 37 in 2009 as losses from discontinued operations in 2010 partially offset the 15 increase in earnings from continuing operations we have a strong backlog entering 2011 and expect global economic conditions to continue to improve through 2012

discontinued operations consistent with our goal of reducing gecc eni and focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge broad distribution and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk in december 2010 we sold our central american bank and card business bac credomatic gecf inc bac in september 2007 we committed to a plan to sell our japanese personal loan business lake upon determining that despite restructuring japanese regulatory limits for interest charges on unsecured personal loans did not permit us to earn an acceptable return during 2008 we completed the sale of ge money japan which included lake along with our japanese mortgage and card businesses excluding our minority ownership in ge nissen credit co ltd discontinued operations also includes our us recreational vehicle and marine equipment finance business consumer rv marine and consumer mexico all of these businesses were previously reported in the ge capital segment 

we reported the businesses described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented for further information about discontinued operations see “segment operations – discontinued operations” in this item and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

we declared 52 billion in dividends in 2010 common pershare dividends of 046 were down 25 from 2009 following a 51 decrease from the preceding year in february 2009 we announced the reduction of the quarterly ge stock dividend by 68 from 031 per share to 010 per share effective with the dividend approved by the board in june 2009 which was paid in the third quarter of 2009 as a result of strong cash generation recovery of ge capital and solid underlying performance in our industrial businesses during 2010 in july 2010 our board of directors approved a 20 increase in our regular quarterly dividend from 010 per share to 012 per share and in december 2010 approved an additional 17 increase from 012 per share to 014 per share on february 11 2011 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 014 per share of common stock which is payable april 25 2011 to shareowners of record at close of business on february 28 2011 in 2010 and 2009 we declared 03 billion in preferred stock dividends 

except as otherwise noted the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of ge with gecs included on a oneline basis and gecs see the segment operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within ge and gecs 

ge sales of product services were 347 billion in 2010 a decrease of 1 compared with 2009 decreases in product services at technology infrastructure were partially offset by increases at energy infrastructure and home  business solutions operating profit from product services was 100 billion in 2010 about flat compared with 2009

postretirement benefit plans costs were 30 billion 26 billion and 22 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively costs increased in 2010 primarily due to the amortization of 2008 investment losses and the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 611 at december 31 2008 to 578 at december 31 2009 partially offset by lower early retirement costs 

costs increased in 2009 primarily because the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 634 at december 31 2007 to 611 at december 31 2008 and increases in early retirements resulting from restructuring activities and contractual requirements partially offset by amortization of prior years’ investment gains and benefits from new healthcare supplier contracts 

our discount rate for our principal pension plans at december 31 2010 was 528 which reflected current interest rates considering the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 80 for cost recognition in 2011 a reduction from the 85 we assumed in 2010 2009 and 2008 gaap provides recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees see the critical accounting estimates section for additional information 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits to increase in 2011 by approximately 11 billion as compared to 2010 primarily because of the effects of additional 2008 investment loss amortization and lower discount rates 

pension expense for our principal pension plans on a gaap basis was 11 billion 05 billion and 02 billion for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively operating pension costs nongaap for these plans were 14 billion 20 billion and 17 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the ge pension plan was underfunded by 28 billion at the end of 2010 as compared to 22 billion at december 31 2009 the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had projected benefit obligations of 44 billion and 38 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in underfunding from yearend 2009 was primarily attributable to the effects of lower discount rates partially offset by an increase in ge pension plan assets our principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 578 at december 31 2009 to 528 at december 31 2010 which increased the pension benefit obligation at yearend 2010 by approximately 29 billion our ge pension plan assets increased from 421 billion at the end of 2009 to 448 billion at december 31 2010 driven by a 135 increase in investment values during the year partially offset by benefit payments assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations 

on an employee retirement income security act erisa basis the ge pension plan was 98 funded at january 1 2011 we will not make any contributions to the ge pension plan in 2011 funding requirements are determined as prescribed by erisa and for ge are based on the plan’s funded status as of the beginning of the previous year and future contributions may vary based on actual plan results assuming our 2011 actual experience is consistent with our current benefit assumptions eg expected return on assets and interest rates we will be required to make about 14 billion in contributions to the ge pension plan in 2012 

at december 31 2010 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 21 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2009 was 27 billion we expect to contribute 07 billion to our other pension plans in 2011 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion and 07 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was 109 billion and 116 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively this decrease was primarily attributable to lower healthcare trends and the effects of healthcare reform provisions on our medicareapproved prescription drug plan partially offset by lower discount rates retiree health and life plans discount rate decreased from 567 at december 31 2009 to 515 at december 31 2010 we expect to contribute 07 billion to these plans in 2011 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion in both 2010 and 2009

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses these costs were 163 143 and 129 of total ge sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in 2010 is primarily due to increased selling expenses to support global growth and higher pension costs partially offset by lower restructuring and other charges 

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 160 billion 183 billion and 258 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 150 billion 175 billion and 247 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively gecs average borrowings declined from 2009 to 2010 and from 2008 to 2009 in line with changes in average gecs assets interest rates have decreased over the threeyear period attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates partially offset by higher average credit spreads gecs average borrowings were 4804 billion 4976 billion and 5212 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the gecs average composite effective interest rate was 31 in 2010 35 in 2009 and 47 in 2008 in 2010 gecs average assets of 6169 billion were 3 lower than in 2009 which in turn were 4 lower than in 2008 see the liquidity and borrowings section for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge 

our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures and our 2009 and 2008 decisions to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us there is a benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because ge funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

income taxes benefit on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 74 in 2010 compared with 115 in 2009 and 56 in 2008 we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to increase in 2011 in part because we expect a high effective tax rate on the pretax gain on the nbcu transaction with comcast more than 3 billion discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the possible expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

  

31 

our benefits from lower taxed global operations declined to 28 billion in 2010 from 40 billion in 2009 principally because of lower earnings in our operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and from losses for which there was not a full tax benefit these decreases also reflected management’s decision in 2009 to indefinitely reinvest prior year earnings outside the us the benefit from lower taxed global operations increased in 2010 by 04 billion due to audit resolutions to the extent global interest rates and nonus operating income increase we would expect tax benefits to increase subject to management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings 

our benefit from lower taxed global operations included the effect of the lower foreign tax rate on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which provided a tax benefit of 20 billion in 2010 and 30 billion in 2009 the tax benefit from nonus income taxed at a local country rather than the us statutory tax rate is reported in the effective tax rate reconciliation in the line “tax on global earnings including exports” 

our benefits from lower taxed global operations declined to 40 billion in 2009 from 51 billion in 2008 including in each year a benefit from the decision to indefinitely reinvest prior year earnings outside the us principally because of lower earnings in our operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate these decreases were partially offset by management’s decision in 2009 to indefinitely reinvest prior year earnings outside the us that was larger than the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us 

our consolidated income tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily because of an increase during 2010 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this decreased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations in addition the consolidated income tax rate increased from 2009 to 2010 due to the decrease discussed above in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations these effects were partially offset by an increase in the benefit from audit resolutions primarily a decrease in the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits from the completion of our 20032005 audit with the irs 

cash income taxes paid in 2010 were 27 billion reflecting the effects of changes to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 

our consolidated income tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily because of a reduction during 2009 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us these effects were partially offset by a decrease from 2008 to 2009 in the benefit from lowertaxed earnings from global operations 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecs and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

because ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings excluding gecs ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecs earnings from continuing operations were 120 billion 126 billion and 142 billion for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 168 in 2010 218 in 2009 and 242 in 2008 

  

32 

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2009 to 2010 primarily because of the 40 percentage point increase in the benefit from audit resolutions shown above 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily because of the 36 percentage point increase in the benefit from lowertaxed earnings from global operations excluding audit resolutions the 2008 ge rate reflects the benefit of lowertaxed earnings from global operations 

the gecs effective income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures there is a benefit from global operations as nonus income is subject to local country tax rates that are significantly below the 35 us statutory rate these nonus earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax the rate of tax on our indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings is below the 35 us statutory rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the us statutory rate and because gecs funds the majority of its nonus operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes 

we expect our ability to benefit from nonus income taxed at less than the us rate to continue subject to changes of us or foreign law including as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the possible expiration of the us tax law provision deferring tax on active financial services income in addition since this benefit depends on management’s intention to indefinitely reinvest amounts outside the us our tax provision will increase to the extent we no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 

as noted above ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return this enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecs effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions in the consolidated return ge makes cash payments to gecs for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due the effect of gecs on the amount of the consolidated tax liability from the formation of the nbcu joint venture will be settled in cash when it otherwise would have reduced the liability of the group absent the tax on joint venture formation 

  

33 

the gecs effective tax rate was 448 in 2010 compared with 1520 in 2009 and 414 in 2008 comparing a tax benefit to pretax income resulted in a negative tax rate in 2010 and 2008 comparing a tax benefit to pretax loss results in the positive tax rate in 2009 the gecs tax benefit of 39 billion in 2009 decreased by 29 billion to 10 billion in 2010 the lower 2010 tax benefit resulted in large part from the change from a pretax loss in 2009 to pretax income in 2010 which increased pretax income 47 billion and decreased the benefit 17 billion the nonrepeat of the onetime benefit related to the 2009 decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest undistributed prior year nonus earnings 07 billion and a decrease in lowertaxed global operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 06 billion caused in part by an increase in losses for which there was not a full tax benefit including an increase in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to the 2008 loss on the sale of ge money japan 02 billion these lower benefits were partially offset by the benefit from resolution of the 20032005 irs audit 03 billion which is reported in the caption “all other – net” in the effective tax rate reconciliation in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

the gecs tax benefit of 23 billion in 2008 increased by 16 billion to 39 billion in 2009 the higher benefit resulted in large part from the change from pretax income in 2008 to a pretax loss in 2009 which decreased pretax income 82 billion and increased the benefit 29 billion and the onetime benefit related to the 2009 decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest undistributed prioryear nonus earnings that was larger than the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear nonus earnings 04 billion these increases in benefits were significantly offset by a decrease in 2009 benefits from lowertaxed global operations as compared to 2008 19 billion substantially as a result of the impact in 2009 of lower interest rates and foreign exchange on the funding of our nonus operations through companies that are subject to a low rate of tax 

during 2009 following the change in gecs external credit ratings funding actions taken and our continued review of our operations liquidity and funding we determined that undistributed prioryear earnings of nonus subsidiaries of gecs on which we had previously provided deferred us taxes would be indefinitely reinvested outside the us this change increased the amount of prioryear earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the us by approximately 2 billion resulting in an income tax benefit of 07 billion in 2009 

the gecs 2008 rate reflects a reduction during 2008 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions which increased the relative effect of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations on the tax rate 

global risk management 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization like ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated we evaluate risk at the individual transaction level and evaluate aggregated risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

risk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of management the ge board of directors board has overall responsibility for risk oversight with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company including strategic operational and reputational risks at the end of each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to prioritize in the next year throughout the year the board and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail strategic operational and reputational risks are presented and discussed in the context of the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings and at presentations to the board and its committees by the vice chairmen chief risk officer general counsel and other officers the board has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific risks to board committees as follows 

  

34 

  

  

  

  

 the ge board’s risk oversight process builds upon management’s risk assessment and mitigation processes which include standardized reviews of longterm strategic and operational planning executive development and evaluation code of conduct compliance under the company’s the spirit  the letter regulatory compliance health safety and environmental compliance financial reporting and controllership and information technology and security ge’s chief risk officer cro is responsible for overseeing and coordinating risk assessment and mitigation on an enterprisewide basis the cro leads the corporate risk function and is responsible for the identification of key business risks providing for appropriate management of these risks within stated limits and enforcement through policies and procedures management has two committees to further assist it in assessing and mitigating risk the policy compliance review board meets between 10 and 14 times a year is chaired by the company’s general counsel and includes the chief financial officer and other senior level functional leaders it has principal responsibility for monitoring compliance matters across the company the corporate risk committee crc meets at least four times a year is chaired by the cro and comprises the chairman and ceo and other senior level business and functional leaders it has principal responsibility for evaluating and addressing risks escalated to the cro and corporate risk function 

ge’s corporate risk function leverages the risk infrastructures in each of our businesses which have adopted an approach that corresponds to the company’s overall risk policies guidelines and review mechanisms in 2010 we augmented the risk infrastructure by formalizing enterprise risk ownership at the business unit level and within our corporate functions our risk infrastructure is designed to identify evaluate and mitigate risks within each of the following categories 

 

  

   

35 

  

 risks identified through our risk management processes are prioritized and depending on the probability and severity of the risk escalated to the cro the cro in coordination with the crc assigns responsibility for the risks to the business or functional leader most suited to manage the risk assigned owners are required to continually monitor evaluate and report on risks for which they bear responsibility enterprise risk leaders within each business and corporate function are responsible to present to the cro and crc risk assessments and key risks at least annually we have general response strategies for managing risks which categorize risks according to whether the company will avoid transfer reduce or accept the risk these response strategies are tailored to ensure that risks are within acceptable ge board tolerance levels 

depending on the nature of the risk involved and the particular business or function affected we use a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies including hedging delegation of authorities operating reviews insurance standardized processes and strategic planning reviews as a matter of policy we generally hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our service businesses employ a comprehensive tollgate process leading up to and through the execution of a contractual service agreement to mitigate legal financial and operational risks furthermore we centrally manage some risks by purchasing insurance the amount of which is determined by balancing the level of risk retained or assumed with the cost of transferring risk to others we manage the risk of fluctuations in economic activity and customer demand by monitoring industry dynamics and responding accordingly including by adjusting capacity implementing cost reductions and engaging in mergers acquisitions and dispositions 

ge capital risk management and oversight 

ge capital has developed a robust risk infrastructure and processes to manage risks related to its businesses and the ge corporate risk function relies upon them in fulfillment of its mission as discussed above starting in march 2011 the ge risk committee will oversee ge capital’s risk assessment and management processes which was previously an audit committee responsibility 

at the ge capital level the gecs board of directors oversees the ge capital risk management process and approves all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as significant borrowings and investments all participants in the ge capital risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the gecs board 

ge capital’s risk management approach rests upon three major tenets a broad spread of risk based on managed exposure limits senior secured commercial financings and a hold to maturity model with transactions underwritten to “onbook” standards dedicated risk professionals across the businesses include underwriters portfolio managers collectors environmental and engineering specialists and specialized asset managers who evaluate leased asset residuals and remarket offlease equipment the senior risk officers have on average over 25 years of experience 

  

36 

ge capital manages risk categories identified in ge capital’s business environment which if materialized could prevent ge capital from achieving its risk objectives andor result in losses these risks are defined as ge capital’s enterprise risk universe which includes the following risks strategic including earnings and capital reputational liquidity credit market operations including financial information technology and legal and compliance 

ge capital’s enterprise risk management committee ermc which is comprised of the most senior leaders in ge capital as well as the ge cro oversees the establishment of appropriate risk systems including policies procedures and management committees that support risk controls to ensure the enterprise risks are effectively identified measured monitored and controlled 

the ermc also oversees the development of ge capital’s overall risk appetite the risk appetite is the amount of risk that ge capital is willing and able to bear expressed as the combination of the enterprise risk objectives and risk limits ge capital’s risk appetite is determined relative to its desired risk objectives including but not limited to standalone credit ratings capital levels liquidity management regulatory assessments earnings dividends and compliance ge capital determines its risk appetite through consideration of portfolio analytics including stress testing and economic capital measurement experience and judgment of senior risk officers current portfolio levels strategic planning and regulatory and rating agency expectations 

ge capital uses stress testing to supplement other risk management processes the ermc approves the highlevel scenarios for and reviews the results of ge capitalwide stress tests across key risk areas such as credit and investment liquidity and market risk stress test results are also expressed in terms of impact to capital levels and metrics and that information is reviewed with the gecs board and the ge risk committee at least twice a year stress testing requirements are set forth in the company’s approved risk policies key policies such as the enterprise risk management policy the enterprise risk appetite statement and the liquidity and capital management policies are approved by the ge risk committee at least annually 

ge capital in coordination with and under the oversight of the ge cro provides comprehensive risk reports to the ge risk committee at these meetings which occur at least four times a year ge capital senior management focuses on the risk strategy and financial services portfolio including the risk oversight processes used to manage all the elements of risk managed by the ermc

segment operations 

our five segments are focused on the broad markets they serve energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal ge capital and home  business solutions in addition to providing information on segments in their entirety we have also provided supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments for greater clarity 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses inprocess research and development and certain other acquisitionrelated charges and balances technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team 

  

37 

segment profit excludes the effects of principal pension plans results reported as discontinued operations earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal and home  business solutions included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for ge capital beginning january 1 2011 we will allocate service costs related to our principal pension plans and we will no longer allocate the retiree costs of our postretirement healthcare benefits to our segments this revised allocation methodology will better align segment operating costs to the active employee costs which are managed by the segments we do not expect this change to significantly affect reported segment results 

we have reclassified certain priorperiod amounts to conform to the currentperiod presentation for additional information about our segments see part i item 1 “business” and note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

energy infrastructure 

 

 energy infrastructure segment revenues decreased 8 or 31 billion in 2010 as lower volume 33 billion and the stronger us dollar 04 billion were partially offset by higher prices 05 billion and higher other income 01 billion lower volume primarily reflected decreases in thermal and wind equipment sales at energy the effects of the stronger us dollar were at both energy and oil  gas higher prices at energy were partially offset by lower prices at oil  gas the increase in other income at energy was partially offset by lower other income at oil  gas 

segment profit increased 2 to 73 billion in 2010 compared with 71 billion in 2009 as higher prices 05 billion the effects of deflation 04 billion and higher other income 01 billion were partially offset by lower volume 06 billion the stronger us dollar 01 billion and decreased productivity 01 billion higher prices at energy were partially offset by lower prices at oil  gas the effects of deflation primarily reflected decreased material costs at both energy and oil  gas an increase in other income at energy was partially offset by lower other income at oil  gas lower volume primarily reflected decreases in wind and thermal equipment sales at energy and was partially offset by higher volume at oil  gas the effects of the stronger us dollar were at both energy and oil  gas the effects of decreased productivity were primarily at energy 

energy infrastructure segment revenues decreased 6 or 24 billion in 2009 as higher prices 13 billion were more than offset by lower volume 25 billion the stronger us dollar 08 billion and lower other income 04 billion primarily related to lower earnings from associated companies and marks on foreign currency contracts the increase in price was primarily at energy the decrease in volume reflected decreased equipment sales at energy partially offset by increased equipment sales at oil  gas the effects of the stronger us dollar were at both energy and oil  gas 

segment profit increased 9 to 71 billion in 2009 compared with 65 billion in 2008 as higher prices 13 billion and lower material and other costs 05 billion were partially offset by lower other income 07 billion primarily related to lower earnings from associated companies and marks on foreign currency contracts lower volume 03 billion and lower productivity 01 billion lower material and other costs were primarily at energy lower volume at energy was partially offset by higher volume at oil  gas the effects of lower productivity were at energy 

energy infrastructure segment orders were 394 billion in both 2010 and 2009 the 273 billion total backlog at yearend 2010 comprised unfilled product orders of 184 billion of which 77 was scheduled for delivery in 2011 and product services orders of 89 billion scheduled for 2011 delivery comparable december 31 2009 total backlog was 291 billion of which 200 billion was for unfilled product orders and 91 billion for product services orders see corporate items and eliminations for a discussion of items not allocated to this segment

corporate items and eliminations 

 

 corporate items and eliminations include the effects of eliminating transactions between operating segments certain disposed businesses including our security business results of our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations cost of our principal pension plans underabsorbed corporate overhead and certain nonallocated amounts described below corporate items and eliminations is not an operating segment rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to consolidated totals on the financial statements 

certain amounts included in corporate items and eliminations cost are not allocated to ge operating segments because they are excluded from the measurement of their operating performance for internal purposes in 2010 these included 05 billion at technology infrastructure and 03 billion at energy infrastructure primarily for technology and product development costs restructuring rationalization and other charges and 03 billion at home  business solutions and 01 billion at nbc universal primarily for restructuring rationalization and other charges in 2009 these included 03 billion at both technology infrastructure and energy infrastructure and 02 billion at home  business solutions primarily for restructuring rationalization and other charges and 03 billion at nbc universal primarily for restructuring rationalization and other charges and technology and product development costs in 2008 amounts primarily related to restructuring rationalization and other charges were 05 billion at nbc universal 04 billion at technology infrastructure and 03 billion at each of energy infrastructure and home  business solutions included in these amounts in 2008 were technology and product development costs of 02 billion at nbc universal and 01 billion at technology infrastructure

discontinued operations 

 

 discontinued operations primarily comprised bac ge money japan our us mortgage business wmc consumer rv marine consumer mexico and plastics results of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we completed the sale of our 100 interest in bac for 19 billion as a result we recognized an aftertax gain of 08 billion in 2010 the disposition of bac is consistent with our goal of reducing eni and focusing our businesses on selective financial services products where we have domain knowledge broad distribution and the ability to earn a consistent return on capital while managing our overall balance sheet size and risk 

  

45 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into agreements to sell consumer rv marine and consumer mexico for approximately 24 billion and approximately 20 billion respectively and have classified these businesses as discontinued operations 

during the third quarter of 2007 we committed to a plan to sell our lake business and recorded an aftertax loss of 09 billion which represented the difference between the net book value of our lake business and the projected sale price during 2008 we completed the sale of ge money japan which included lake along with our japanese mortgage and card businesses excluding our minority ownership interest in ge nissen credit co ltd in connection with this sale and primarily related to our japanese mortgage and card businesses we recorded an incremental 04 billion loss in 2008 

in 2010 loss from discontinued operations net of taxes primarily reflected incremental reserves for excess interest claims related to our losssharing arrangement on the 2008 sale of ge money japan 17 billion and estimated aftertax losses of 02 billion and 01 billion on the planned sales of consumer mexico and consumer rv marine respectively partially offset by an aftertax gain on the sale of bac of 08 billion and earnings from operations at consumer mexico of 02 billion and at bac of 01 billion

geographic operations 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new profit opportunities potential increased risks include among other things higher receivable delinquencies and bad debts delays or cancellations of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment higher local currency financing costs and slowdown in established financial services activities new profit opportunities include among other things more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas we classify certain operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose

geographic revenues 

 

 global revenues decreased 4 to 797 billion in 2010 compared with 831 billion and 966 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 53 in 2010 compared with 54 in 2009 and 53 in 2008 the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results increased revenues by 05 billion in 2010 decreased revenues by 39 billion in 2009 and increased revenues by 20 billion in 2008 

ge global revenues excluding gecs in 2010 were 533 billion down 5 over 2009 decreases of 12 in europe and 9 in the middle east and africa more than offset increases in growth markets of 43 in australia and 18 in latin america these revenues as a percentage of ge total revenues excluding gecs were 53 in 2010 compared with 55 and 53 in 2009 and 2008 respectively ge global revenues excluding gecs were 564 billion in 2009 down 5 from 2008 primarily resulting from decreases in western europe and latin america 

gecs global revenues decreased 1 to 264 billion in 2010 compared with 267 billion and 372 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively primarily as a result of decreases in europe gecs global revenues as a percentage of total gecs revenues were 52 in 2010 compared with 51 and 53 in 2009 and 2008 respectively gecs global revenue decreased by 28 in 2009 from 372 billion in 2008 primarily due to dispositions in europe and the pacific basin 

total assets continuing operations 

 

 total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were 3586 billion in 2010 a decrease of 209 billion or 6 from 2009 gecs global assets on a continuing basis of 2796 billion at the end of 2010 were 9 lower than at the end of 2009 reflecting core declines in europe and the pacific basin primarily due to portfolio runoff in various businesses at consumer and lower financing receivables and equipment leased to others at cll 

financial results of our global activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen the canadian dollar and the australian dollar

environmental matters 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a sizeable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 02 billion in 2010 03 billion in 2009 and 02 billion in 2008 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about 04 billion for each of the next two years 

as previously disclosed in 2006 we entered into a consent decree with the environmental protection agency epa to dredge pcbcontaining sediment from the upper hudson river the consent decree provided that the dredging would be performed in two phases phase 1 was completed in may through november of 2009 between phase 1 and phase 2 there was an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts the panel evaluated the performance of phase 1 dredging operations with respect to phase 1 engineering performance standards and recommended proposed changes to the standards on december 17 2010 epa issued its decisions setting forth the final performance standards for phase 2 of the dredging project incorporating aspects of the recommendations from the independent peer review panel and from ge in december 2010 we agreed with epa to perform phase 2 of the project in accordance with the final performance standards set by epa we have reviewed epa’s final performance standards for phase 2 to assess the potential scope and duration of phase 2 as well as operational and engineering changes that could be required based on this review and our best professional engineering judgment we increased our reserve for the probable and estimable costs for completing the hudson river dredging project by 08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 

financial resources and liquidity 

this discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the statement of financial position liquidity and borrowings debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity the statement of cash flows contractual obligations and variable interest entities 

overview of financial position 

major changes to our shareowners’ equity are discussed in the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity section in addition other significant changes to balances in our statement of financial position follow 

statement of financial position 

because ge and gecs share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position – property plant and equipment and borrowings for example – the following discussion addresses significant captions in the “consolidated” statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecs activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

investment securities comprise mainly investment grade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations and holders of guaranteed investment contracts gics in trinity which ceased issuing new investment contracts beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and investment securities held at our global banks the fair value of investment securities decreased to 439 billion at december 31 2010 from 513 billion at december 31 2009 primarily driven by a decrease in retained interests as a result of our adoption of fasb accounting standards update asu 200916 and asu 200917 amendments to asc 860 transfers and servicing  and asc 810 consolidations  respectively asu 200916  17 and maturities partially offset by improved market conditions of the amount at december 31 2010 we held debt securities with an estimated fair value of 428 billion which included corporate debt securities residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs with estimated fair values of 254 billion 28 billion and 29 billion respectively unrealized losses on debt securities were 14 billion and 26 billion at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively this amount included unrealized losses on corporate debt securities rmbs and cmbs of 04 billion 04 billion and 01 billion respectively at december 31 2010 as compared with 08 billion 08 billion and 04 billion respectively at december 31 2009

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative criteria we presently do not intend to sell our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost we believe that the unrealized loss associated with our equity securities will be recovered within the foreseeable future 

our rmbs portfolio is collateralized primarily by pools of individual direct mortgage loans a majority of which were originated in 2006 and 2005 not other structured products such as collateralized debt obligations substantially all of our rmbs securities are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals and 65 are agency bonds or insured by monoline insurers on which we continue to place reliance of our total rmbs portfolio at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 approximately 07 billion and 09 billion respectively relate to residential subprime credit primarily supporting our guaranteed investment contracts a majority of exposure to residential subprime credit related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 substantially all of the subprime rmbs were investment grade at the time of purchase and approximately 72 have been subsequently downgraded to below investment grade 

our cmbs portfolio is collateralized by both diversified pools of mortgages that were originated for securitization conduit cmbs and pools of large loans backed by high quality properties large loan cmbs a majority of which were originated in 2007 and 2006 substantially all of the securities in our cmbs portfolio have investment grade credit ratings and the vast majority of the securities are in a senior position in the capital structure 

our assetbacked securities abs portfolio is collateralized by a variety of diversified pools of assets such as student loans and credit cards as well as large senior secured loans of high quality middle market companies in a variety of industries the vast majority of our abs securities are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deals in addition substantially all of the securities that are below investment grade are in an unrealized gain position 

for abs including rmbs we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model that considers estimates of cash flows generated from the underlying collateral estimates of cash flows consider internal credit risk interest rate and prepayment assumptions that incorporate management’s best estimate of key assumptions including default rates loss severity and prepayment rates for cmbs we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit by evaluating potential losses on each of the underlying loans in the security collateral cash flows are considered in the context of our position in the capital structure of the deals assumptions can vary widely depending upon the collateral type geographic concentrations and vintage 

if there has been an adverse change in cash flows for rmbs management considers credit enhancements such as monoline insurance which are features of a specific security in evaluating the overall creditworthiness of the monoline insurer monoline we use an analysis that is similar to the approach we use for corporate bonds including an evaluation of the sufficiency of the monoline’s cash reserves and capital ratings activity whether the monoline is in default or default appears imminent and the potential for intervention by an insurance or other regulator 

monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities primarily rmbs and municipal securities the credit enhancement is a feature of each specific security that guarantees the payment of all contractual cash flows and is not purchased separately by ge the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities we continue to rely on monolines with adequate capital and claims paying resources we have reduced our reliance on monolines that do not have adequate capital or have experienced regulator intervention at december 31 2010 our investment securities insured by monolines on which we continue to place reliance were 17 billion including 03 billion of our 07 billion investment in subprime rmbs at december 31 2010 the unrealized loss associated with securities subject to monoline credit enhancement for which there is an expected credit loss was 03 billion 

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during 2010 were 05 billion of which 03 billion was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on rmbs nonus government securities nonus corporate securities and equity securities and 02 billion primarily relates to noncredit related losses on rmbs and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income

our qualitative review attempts to identify issuers’ securities that are “atrisk” of otherthantemporary impairment that is for securities that we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of our amortized cost whether there is a possibility of credit loss that would result in an otherthantemporary impairment recognition in the following 12 months securities we have identified as “atrisk” primarily relate to investments in rmbs securities and nonus corporate debt securities across a broad range of industries the amount of associated unrealized loss on these securities at december 31 2010 is 04 billion credit losses that would be recognized in earnings are calculated when we determine the security to be otherthantemporarily impaired uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments 

at december 31 2010 unrealized losses on investment securities totaled 14 billion including 12 billion aged 12 months or longer compared with unrealized losses of 26 billion including 23 billion aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2009 of the amount aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2010 more than 70 of our debt securities were considered to be investment grade by the major rating agencies in addition of the amount aged 12 months or longer 07 billion and 03 billion related to structured securities mortgagebacked assetbacked and securitization retained interests and corporate debt securities respectively with respect to our investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2010 the vast majority relate to debt securities held to support obligations to holders of gics and annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations we presently do not intend to sell our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

fair value measurements  for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date additional information about our application of this guidance is provided in notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

investments measured at fair value in earnings include equity investments of 08 billion at yearend 2010 the earnings effects of changes in fair value on these assets favorable and unfavorable will be reflected in the period in which those changes occur as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report we also have assets that are classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business loans and real estate properties carried at 35 billion at yearend 2010 which represents the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell to the extent that the estimated fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value any favorable or unfavorable changes in fair value will be reflected in earnings in the period in which such changes occur 

working capital  representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections was 16 billion at december 31 2010 down an insignificant amount from december 31 2009 as reductions in inventory and an increase in accounts payable were offset by higher current receivables and lower progress collections as energy infrastructure and technology infrastructure deliver units out of their backlogs over the next few years progress collections of 118 billion at december 31 2010 will be earned which along with progress collections on new orders will impact working capital throughout the last four years we have executed a significant number of initiatives through our operating council such as lean cycle time projects which have resulted in a more efficient use of working capital we expect to continue these initiatives in 2011 which should significantly offset the effects of decreases in progress collections 

we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

  

50 

current receivables for ge totaled to 104 billion at the end of 2010 and 98 billion at the end of 2009 and included 81 billion due from customers at the end of 2010 compared with 75 billion at the end of 2009 ge current receivables turnover was 86 in 2010 compared with 82 in 2009 the overall increase in current receivables was primarily due to the higher volume in technology infrastructure businesses 

inventories for ge totaled to 115 billion at december 31 2010 down 05 billion from the end of 2009 this decrease reflected lower inventories at energy infrastructure partially offset by higher inventories at technology infrastructure ge inventory turnover was 72 and 68 in 2010 and 2009 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows 

our consumer portfolio is largely nonus and primarily comprises mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries our us consumer financing receivables comprise 14 of our total portfolio of those approximately 63 relate primarily to credit cards which are often subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements with the retailer the results of which are reflected in revenues and have a smaller average balance and lower loss severity as compared to bank cards the remaining 37 are sales finance receivables which provide electronics recreation medical and home improvement financing to customers in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans 

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes which for our cll business primarily include industrialrelated facilities and equipment vehicles corporate aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation media communications entertainment and healthcare industries the portfolios in our real estate gecas and energy financial services businesses are collateralized by commercial real estate commercial aircraft and operating assets in the global energy and water industries respectively we are in a secured position for substantially all of our commercial portfolio 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible to experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio as a result the allowance for losses is not carried over at acquisition this may have the effect of causing lower reserve coverage ratios for those portfolios 

  

51 

for purposes of the discussion that follows “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection is otherwise doubtful nonearning receivables exclude loans purchased at a discount unless they have deteriorated post acquisition under asc 310 receivables  these loans are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition in addition nonearning receivables exclude loans that are paying on a cash accounting basis but classified as nonaccrual and impaired “nonaccrual” financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms but may remain classified as nonaccrual until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection 

further information on the determination of the allowance for losses on financing receivables and the credit quality and categorization of our financing receivables is provided in the critical accounting estimates section of this item and notes 1 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

on january 1 2010 we adopted asu 200916  17 resulting in the consolidation of 402 billion of net financing receivables at january 1 2010 we have provided comparisons of our financing receivables portfolio at december 31 2010 to january 1 2010 as we believe that it provides a more meaningful comparison of our portfolio quality following the adoption of asu 200916  17 

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 3273 billion at december 31 2010 and 3767 billion at january 1 2010 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 494 billion from january 1 2010 primarily as a result of collections exceeding originations 263 billion which includes sales writeoffs 101 billion the stronger us dollar 21 billion and dispositions 12 billion partially offset by acquisitions 28 billion 

related nonearning receivables totaled 116 billion 35 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2010 compared with 142 billion 38 of outstanding receivables at january 1 2010 nonearning receivables decreased from january 1 2010 primarily due to improvements in our entry rates in consumer and improved performance in commercial offset by increased real estate delinquencies driven by the continued challenging environment in the commercial real estate markets 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2010 totaled 81 billion compared with 96 billion at january 1 2010 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio allowance for losses decreased 15 billion from january 1 2010 primarily because provisions were lower than writeoffs net of recoveries by 13 billion which is attributable to a reduction in the overall financing receivables balance and an improvement in the overall credit environment the allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables increased from 23 at december 31 2009 to 25 at december 31 2010 primarily due to the adoption of asu 200916  17 on january 1 2010 further information surrounding the allowance for losses related to each of our portfolios is detailed below 

the following table provides information surrounding selected ratios related to nonearning financing receivables and the allowance for losses 

  

54 

  

  

 included below is a discussion of financing receivables allowance for losses nonearning receivables and related metrics for each of our significant portfolios 

  

55 

cll – americas  nonearning receivables of 26 billion represented 222 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 362 at january 1 2010 to 501 at december 31 2010 reflecting an overall decrease in nonearning receivables combined with a further slight increase in loss severity in our equipment and franchise restaurant and hotel portfolios the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 34 at january 1 2010 to 30 at december 31 2010 primarily due to reduced nonearning exposures in our corporate lending corporate aircraft and industrial materials portfolios which more than offset deterioration in our healthcare and franchise restaurant and hotel portfolios collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables primarily includes corporate aircraft and assets in the restaurant and hospitality trucking and forestry industries and for our leveraged finance business equity of the underlying businesses 

cll – europe  nonearning receivables of 12 billion represented 107 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 399 at january 1 2010 to 346 at december 31 2010 as a greater proportion of nonearning receivables was attributable to the interbanca spa portfolio which was acquired in 2009 the loans acquired with interbanca spa were recorded at fair value which incorporates an estimate at the acquisition date of credit losses over their remaining life accordingly these loans generally have a lower ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables compared to the remaining portfolio excluding the nonearning loans attributable to the 2009 acquisition of interbanca spa the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased slightly from 672 at january 1 2010 to 657 at december 31 2010 due to the increase of highly collateralized nonearning receivables in our senior secured lending portfolio partially offset by a reduction in nonearning receivables in our senior secured lending and equipment finance portfolios due to restructuring sale or writeoff the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables remained consistent at 33 at december 31 2010 due to an increase in nonearning receivables in the interbanca spa portfolio offset by the decrease in nonearning receivables across our senior secured lending equipment finance and assetbased lending portfolios primarily for the reasons previously mentioned collateral supporting these secured nonearning financing receivables are primarily equity of the underlying businesses for our senior secured lending business and equipment and trade receivables for our equipment finance and assetbased lending portfolios respectively 

cll – asia  nonearning receivables of 04 billion represented 35 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 419 at january 1 2010 to 547 at december 31 2010 primarily as a result of restructuring sale or writeoff of nonearning receivables in our assetbased financing businesses in japan which is highly collateralized the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables decreased from 42 at january 1 2010 to 34 at december 31 2010 primarily due to the decline in nonearning receivables related to our assetbased financing businesses in japan partially offset by a lower financing receivables balance collateral supporting these nonearning financing receivables is primarily commercial real estate manufacturing equipment corporate aircraft and assets in the auto industry 

real estate – debt  nonearning receivables of 10 billion represented 83 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the increase in nonearning receivables from january 1 2010 was driven primarily by increased delinquencies in the us office portfolio and the european hotel and retail portfolios partially offset by foreclosures and discounted payoffs primarily related to us multifamily loans the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 1443 to 1344 reflecting writeoffs driven by settlements and payoffs from impaired loan borrowers since our approach identifies loans as impaired even when the loan is currently paying in accordance with contractual terms increases in nonearning receivables do not necessarily require proportionate increases in reserves upon migration to nonearning status as specific reserves have often been established on the loans prior to their migration to nonearning status the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of total financing receivables increased from 37 at january 1 2010 to 43 at december 31 2010 driven primarily by continued rental rate deterioration in the us markets which resulted in an increase in specific credit loss provisions

the real estate financing receivables portfolio is collateralized by incomeproducing or owneroccupied commercial properties across a variety of asset classes and markets at december 31 2010 total real estate financing receivables of 402 billion were primarily collateralized by owner occupied properties 100 billion office buildings 94 billion apartment buildings 62 billion and hotel properties 44 billion in 2010 commercial real estate markets have continued to be under pressure with limited market liquidity and challenging economic conditions we have and continue to maintain an intense focus on operations and risk management loan loss reserves related to our real estate  debt financing receivables are particularly sensitive to declines in underlying property values assuming global property values decline an incremental 1 or 5 and that decline occurs evenly across geographies and asset classes we estimate incremental loan loss reserves would be required of approximately 01 billion and 04 billion respectively estimating the impact of global property values on loss performance across our portfolio depends on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions property level operating performance local market dynamics and individual borrower behavior as a result any sensitivity analyses or attempts to forecast potential losses carry a high degree of imprecision and are subject to change at december 31 2010 we had 116 foreclosed commercial real estate properties which had a value of approximately 06 billion 

consumer – nonus residential mortgages  nonearning receivables of 38 billion represented 330 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased slightly from 214 at january 1 2010 to 217 at december 31 2010 in 2010 our nonearning receivables decreased primarily due to continued collection and loss mitigation efforts and signs of stabilization in the uk housing market our nonus mortgage portfolio has a loantovalue ratio of approximately 75 at origination and the vast majority are first lien positions our uk and france portfolios which comprise a majority of our total mortgage portfolio have reindexed loantovalue ratios of 83 and 60 respectively about 3 of these loans are without mortgage insurance and have a reindexed loantovalue ratio equal to or greater than 100 loantovalue information is updated on a quarterly basis for a majority of our loans and considers economic factors such as the housing price index at december 31 2010 we had in repossession stock approximately 700 houses in the uk which had a value of approximately 01 billion the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percent of financing receivables increased from 79 at january 1 2010 to 84 at december 31 2010 primarily due to reduced originations across all platforms 

consumer – nonus installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 03 billion represented 25 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 2729 at january 1 2010 to 3259 at december 31 2010 reflecting changes in business mix following the reclassification of nonearning receivables to assets of businesses held for sale following our commitment in 2010 to sell our consumer businesses in argentina brazil and canada 

consumer – us installment and revolving credit  nonearning receivables of 12 billion represented 104 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2010 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables remained consistent at approximately 1942 the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percentage of financing receivables decreased from 37 at january 1 2010 to 27 at december 31 2010 primarily due to lower delinquencies reflecting an improvement in the overall credit environment 

nonaccrual financing receivables 

the following table provides details related to our nonaccrual and nonearning financing receivables nonaccrual financing receivables include all nonearning receivables and are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we stop accruing interest at the earlier of the time at which collection becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days past due substantially all of the differences between nonearning and nonaccrual financing receivables relate to loans which are classified as nonaccrual financing receivables but are paying on a cash accounting basis and therefore excluded from nonearning receivables of our 214 billion nonaccrual loans at december 31 2010 93 billion are currently paying in accordance with their contractual terms 

  

57 

 impaired loans 

“impaired” loans in the table below are defined as larger balance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement the vast majority of our consumer and a portion of our cll nonaccrual receivables are excluded from this definition as they represent smaller balance homogeneous loans that we evaluate collectively by portfolio for impairment 

impaired loans include nonearning receivables on larger balance or restructured loans loans that are currently paying interest under the cash basis but are excluded from the nonearning category and loans paying currently but which have been previously restructured 

specific reserves are recorded for individually impaired loans to the extent we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement certain loans classified as impaired may not require a reserve because we believe that we will ultimately collect the unpaid balance through collection or collateral repossession 

  

58 

further information pertaining to loans classified as impaired and specific reserves is included in the table below 

 

  

  

  

  

 impaired loans consolidated as a result of our adoption of asu 200916  17 primarily related to our consumer business impaired loans increased by 48 billion from january 1 2010 to december 31 2010 primarily relating to increases at real estate we regularly review our real estate loans for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors such as debt service coverage and loantovalue ratios see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report we classify real estate loans as impaired when the most recent valuation reflects a projected loantovalue ratio at maturity in excess of 100 even if the loan is currently paying in accordance with contractual terms the increase in real estate impaired loans reflects deterioration in commercial real estate values particularly in japan and the us as well as an increase in troubled debt restructurings tdrs real estate specific reserves have not increased proportionately to the increase in impaired loans primarily due to an increase in tdrs that are expected to be fully recoverable based on the value of the underlying collateral and are performing in accordance with their modified terms of our 98 billion impaired loans at real estate at december 31 2010 81 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and are typically loans where the borrower has adequate debt service coverage to meet contractual interest obligations impaired loans at cll primarily represent senior secured lending positions 

our impaired loan balance at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 classified by the method used to measure impairment was as follows

 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for further information on collateral dependent loans and our valuation process 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions forbearance or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a tdr and also as impaired changes to real estate’s loans primarily include maturity extensions principal payment acceleration changes to collateral terms and cash sweeps which are in addition to or sometimes in lieu of fees and rate increases the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions of our commercial loans meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances at december 31 2010 tdrs included in impaired loans were 101 billion primarily relating to real estate 49 billion cll 29 billion and consumer 23 billion tdrs consolidated as a result of our adoption of asu 200916  17 primarily related to our consumer business 04 billion 

we utilize certain shortterm loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary financial difficulties in our consumer loan portfolio these loan modification programs are primarily concentrated in our us credit card and nonus residential mortgage portfolios we sold our us residential mortgage business in 2007 and as such do not participate in the us governmentsponsored mortgage modification programs during 2010 we provided shortterm modifications of approximately 27 billion of consumer loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties this included approximately 12 billion of credit card loans in the us and approximately 15 billion of other consumer loans primarily nonus residential mortgages credit cards and personal loans which were not classified as tdrs for these modified loans we provided shortterm 12 months or less interest rate reductions and payment deferrals which were not part of the terms of the original contract we expect borrowers whose loans have been modified under these shortterm programs to continue to be able to meet their contractual obligations upon the conclusion of the shortterm modification our experience indicates that a substantial majority of loan modifications during 2010 have been successful as approximately 22 billion are performing in accordance with the revised contractual terms 

delinquencies 

additional information on delinquency rates at each of our major portfolios follows 

 

 delinquency rates on commercial loans and leases decreased from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 as a result of improvements in the global economic and credit environment we expect the global environment to show further signs of stabilization in 2011 however the credit environment continues to be uncertain and may impact future levels of commercial delinquencies and provisions for losses on financing receivables 

  

60 

delinquency rates on consumer financing receivables decreased from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 primarily due to improved collections and lower delinquency entry rates in our us markets we expect the global environment along with us unemployment levels to further show signs of stabilization in 2011 however the uncertain economic environment may result in higher provisions for loan losses at december 31 2010 approximately 41 of our us portfolio which consisted of credit cards installment and revolving loans were receivable from subprime borrowers we had no us subprime residential mortgage loans at december 31 2010 see notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for additional information 

delinquency rates on real estate loans and leases increased from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 primarily reflecting continued challenging real estate market fundamentals including reduced occupancy rates and rentals and the effects of real estate market liquidity which despite stabilization in certain markets continues to remain limited in many others slow economic recovery could result in a continuation of elevated delinquency levels and provisions for losses on financing receivables 

other gecs receivables totaled 143 billion at december 31 2010 and 186 billion at december 31 2009 and consisted primarily of amounts due from ge primarily related to material procurement programs of 27 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively insurance receivables nonfinancing customer receivables amounts due under operating leases amounts accrued from investment income and various sundry items amounts due from qualified special purpose entities qspes declined from 37 billion in 2009 to 01 billion in 2010 as a result of our adoption of asu 200916  17 

property plant and equipment totaled 662 billion at december 31 2010 down 28 billion from 2009 primarily reflecting a reduction in equipment leased to others and the deconsolidation of regency by gecs ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecs was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge additions to property plant and equipment totaled 24 billion in both 2010 and 2009 respectively total expenditures excluding equipment leased to others for the past five years were 135 billion of which 40 was investment for growth through new capacity and product development 25 was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements and 35 was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection 

gecs additions to property plant and equipment were 77 billion and 64 billion during 2010 and 2009 respectively primarily reflecting acquisitions and additions of commercial aircraft at gecas offset by disposals of fleet vehicles at cll 

goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 645 billion and 100 billion respectively at december 31 2010 goodwill decreased 06 billion from 2009 primarily from the deconsolidation of regency and the strengthening of the us dollar partially offset by the acquisition of clarient inc other intangible assets decreased 18 billion from 2009 primarily from dispositions and amortization expense see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

all other assets comprise mainly real estate equity properties and investments equity and cost method investments contract costs and estimated earnings derivative instruments and assets held for sale and totaled 963 billion at december 31 2010 a decrease of 69 billion primarily related to declines in our real estate equity properties due to impairments depreciation and the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of cost and equity method investments excluding those related to real estate of 01 billion 

  

61 

included in other assets are real estate equity investments of 272 billion and 322 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type we review the estimated values of our commercial real estate investments semiannually as of our most recent estimate performed in 2010 the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by approximately 51 billion the estimated value of the portfolio continues to reflect deterioration in real estate values and market fundamentals including reduced market occupancy rates and market rents as well as the effects of limited real estate market liquidity given the current and expected challenging market conditions there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses during 2010 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 23 billion in its real estate held for investment compared with 08 billion in 2009 real estate investments with undiscounted cash flows in excess of carrying value of 0 to 5 at december 31 2010 had a carrying value of 18 billion and an associated unrealized loss of approximately 04 billion continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized 

contract costs and estimated earnings reflect revenues earned in excess of billings on our longterm contracts to construct technically complex equipment such as power generation aircraft engines and aeroderivative units and longterm product maintenance or extended warranty arrangements our total contract costs and estimated earnings balances at december 31 2010 and 2009 were 81 billion and 77 billion respectively reflecting the timing of billing in relation to work performed as well as changes in estimates of future revenues and costs our total contract costs and estimated earnings balance at december 31 2010 primarily related to customers in our energy aviation and transportation businesses further information is provided in the critical accounting estimates section 

liquidity and borrowings 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity at both ge and gecs we manage our liquidity to help ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles 

our liquidity and borrowing plans for ge and gecs are established within the context of our annual financial and strategic planning processes at ge our liquidity and funding plans take into account the liquidity necessary to fund our operating commitments which include primarily purchase obligations for inventory and equipment payroll and general expenses we also take into account our capital allocation and growth objectives including paying dividends repurchasing shares investing in research and development and acquiring industrial businesses at ge we rely primarily on cash generated through our operating activities and also have historically maintained a commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund operations in the us principally within fiscal quarters 

gecs liquidity and funding plans are designed to meet gecs’ funding requirements under normal and stress scenarios which include primarily extensions of credit payroll principal payments on outstanding borrowings interest on borrowings dividends to ge and general obligations such as operating expenses collateral deposits held or collateral posted to counterparties gecs’ funding plan also has been developed in connection with our strategy to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital gecs relies on cash generated through collection of principal interest and other payments on our existing portfolio of loans and leases sales of assets and unsecured and secured funding sources including commercial paper term debt bank borrowings securitization and other retail funding products 

our 2011 gecs funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding shortterm borrowings including the current portion of our longterm debt 1188 billion at december 31 2010 through issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt cash on hand collections of financing receivables exceeding originations dispositions asset sales and deposits and alternative sources of funding interest on borrowings is primarily repaid through interest earned on existing financing receivables during 2010 gecs earned interest income on financing receivables of 241 billion which more than offset interest expense of 150 billion 

  

62 

both the gecs board of directors and the ge audit committee have approved a detailed liquidity policy for gecs which includes a requirement to maintain a contingency funding plan the liquidity policy defines gecs’ liquidity risk tolerance under different scenarios based on its liquidity sources and also establishes procedures to escalate potential issues we actively monitor gecs’ access to funding markets and liquidity profile through tracking external indicators and testing various stress scenarios the contingency funding plan provides a framework for handling market disruptions and establishes escalation procedures in the event that such events or circumstances arise 

actions taken to strengthen and maintain our liquidity are described in the following section 

liquidity sources 

we maintain liquidity sources that consist of cash and equivalents and a portfolio of highquality liquid investments liquidity portfolio and committed unused credit lines 

we have cash and equivalents of 790 billion at december 31 2010 which is available to meet our needs a substantial portion of this is freely available about 10 billion is in regulated entities and is subject to regulatory restrictions or is in restricted countries about 18 billion is held outside the us and is available to fund operations and other growth of nonus subsidiaries it is also available to fund our needs in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax we anticipate that we will continue to generate cash from operating activities in the future which will be available to help meet our liquidity needs 

in addition to our 79 billion of cash and equivalents we have a centrallymanaged portfolio of highquality liquid investments with a fair value of 29 billion at december 31 2010 the liquidity portfolio is used to manage liquidity and meet the operating needs of gecs under both normal and stress scenarios the investments consist of unencumbered us government securities us agency securities securities guaranteed by the government supranational securities and a select group of nonus government securities we believe that we can readily obtain cash for these securities even in stressed market conditions 

we have committed unused credit lines totaling 518 billion that have been extended to us by 58 financial institutions at december 31 2010 these lines include 356 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 162 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for one year from the date of expiration of the lending agreement during 2010 we renewed all of the 364day lines and we extended the term of 23 billion of multiyear lines by one year to 2013 

at december 31 2010 our aggregate cash and equivalents and committed credit lines were more than twice gecs’ commercial paper borrowings balance 

funding plan 

our strategy has been to reduce our ending net investment in ge capital in 2010 we reduced our ge capital ending net investment excluding cash and equivalents from 526 billion at january 1 2010 to 477 billion at december 31 2010 

in 2010 we completed issuances of 25 billion of senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 17 years and subsequent to december 31 2010 an additional 11 billion average commercial paper borrowings for gecs and ge during the fourth quarter were 401 billion and 60 billion respectively and the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding for gecs and ge during the fourth quarter was 424 billion and 72 billion respectively gecs commercial paper maturities are funded principally through new issuances and at ge are repaid by quarterend using available cash

under the federal deposit insurance corporation’s fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp the fdic guaranteed certain senior unsecured debt issued by gecc on or before october 31 2009 for which we incurred 23 billion of fees for our participation our tlgpguaranteed debt has remaining maturities of 18 billion in 2011 25 billion matured in january 2011 and 35 billion in 2012 we anticipate funding these and our other longterm debt maturities through a combination of existing cash new debt issuances collections exceeding originations dispositions asset sales deposits and alternative sources of funding gecc and ge are parties to an eligible entity designation agreement and gecc is subject to the terms of a master agreement each entered into with the fdic the terms of these agreements include among other things a requirement that ge and gecc reimburse the fdic for any amounts that the fdic pays to holders of gecc debt that is guaranteed by the fdic 

we securitize financial assets as an alternative source of funding on january 1 2010 we adopted asu 200916  17 which resulted in the consolidation of 361 billion of nonrecourse borrowings from all of our securitization qspes during 2010 we completed 103 billion of nonrecourse issuances and had maturities of 223 billion at december 31 2010 consolidated nonrecourse borrowings were 301 billion we anticipate that securitization will remain a part of our overall funding capabilities notwithstanding the changes in consolidation rules described in notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

our issuances of securities repurchase agreements are insignificant and are limited to activities at certain of our foreign banks at december 31 2010 and 2009 we were party to repurchase agreements totaling insignificant amounts which were accounted for as onbook financings we have had no repurchase agreements which were not accounted for as financings and we do not engage in securities lending transactions 

we have deposittaking capability at 10 banks outside of the us and two banks in the us – ge money bank a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit cds distributed by brokers in maturity terms from three months to ten years 

total alternative funding at december 31 2010 was 60 billion composed mainly of 37 billion bank deposits 11 billion of funding secured by real estate aircraft and other collateral and 9 billion ge interest plus notes the comparable amount at december 31 2009 was 57 billion 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that model effects of shifts in rates these are not forecasts

debt and derivative instruments guarantees and covenants 

principal debt and derivative conditions are described below 

certain of our derivative instruments can be terminated if specified credit ratings are not maintained and certain debt and derivatives agreements of other consolidated entities have provisions that are affected by these credit ratings as of december 31 2010 ge and gecc’s longterm unsecured debt credit rating from standard and poor’s ratings service sp was “aa” with a stable outlook and from moody’s investors service “moody’s” was “aa2” with a stable outlook as of december 31 2010 ge gecs and gecc’s shortterm credit rating from sp was “a1” and from moody’s was “p1” we are disclosing these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds although we currently do not expect a downgrade in the credit ratings our ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

derivatives agreements 

swap forward and option contracts are executed under standard master agreements that typically contain mutual downgrade provisions that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the longterm credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below aa3 in certain of these master agreements the counterparty also has the ability to require termination if the shortterm rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below a1p1 the net derivative liability after consideration of netting arrangements outstanding interest payments and collateral posted by us under these master agreements was estimated to be 10 billion at december 31 2010 see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

ratio of earnings to fixed charges income maintenance agreement and subordinated debentures 

on march 28 1991 ge entered into an agreement with gecc to make payments to gecc constituting additions to pretax income under the agreement to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc and consolidated affiliates determined on a consolidated basis to be not less than 1101 for the period as a single aggregation of each gecc fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991 gecc’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges increased to 1131 during 2010 due to higher pretax earnings at gecc which were primarily driven by higher margins and lower provisions for losses on financing receivables 

on october 29 2009 ge and gecc amended this agreement to extend the notice period for termination from three years to five years it was further amended to provide that any future amendments to the agreement that could adversely affect gecc require the consent of the majority of the holders of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured debt securities issued or guaranteed by gecc with an original stated maturity in excess of 270 days unless the amendment does not trigger a downgrade of gecc’s longterm ratings no payment is required in 2011 pursuant to this agreement 

ge made a 95 billion payment to gecs in the first quarter of 2009 of which 88 billion was further contributed to gecc through capital contribution and share issuance to improve tangible capital and reduce leverage this payment constitutes an addition to pretax income under the agreement and therefore increased the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of gecc for the fiscal year 2009 for purposes of the agreement to 1331 as a result no further payments under the agreement in 2010 were required related to 2009 

any payment made under the income maintenance agreement will not affect the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as determined in accordance with current sec rules because it does not constitute an addition to pretax income under current us gaap 

in addition in connection with certain subordinated debentures for which gecc receives equity credit by rating agencies ge has agreed to promptly return dividends distributions or other payments it receives from gecc during events of default or interest deferral periods under such subordinated debentures there were 73 billion of such debentures outstanding at december 31 2010 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity 

ge shareowners’ equity increased by 16 billion in 2010 compared with an increase of 126 billion in 2009 and a decrease of 109 billion in 2008 

net earnings increased ge shareowners’ equity by 116 billion 110 billion and 174 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 52 billion 68 billion and 126 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

elements of other comprehensive income decreased shareowners’ equity by 23 billion in 2010 compared with an increase of 66 billion in 2009 and a decrease of 302 billion in 2008 inclusive of changes in accounting principles the components of these changes are as follows 

 

   

66 

  

  

 we took a number of actions in 2008 and 2009 to strengthen our liquidity such actions also had an effect on shareowners’ equity which included a 15 billion addition to equity through common and preferred stock offerings in the fourth quarter of 2008 

statement of cash flows – overview from 2008 through 2010 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 790 billion at december 31 2010 an increase of 85 billion from december 31 2009 cash and equivalents totaled 705 billion at december 31 2009 an increase of 224 billion from december 31 2008 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

ge cash flow 

ge cash and equivalents were 192 billion at december 31 2010 compared with 87 billion at december 31 2009 ge cfoa totaled 147 billion in 2010 compared with 164 billion and 191 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively with respect to ge cfoa we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

  

67 

  

 

 

 the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections decreased by 59 billion in 2010 and decreased by 114 billion in 2009 these changes are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section are the best way of understanding their customerrelated cfoa 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services ge operating cash payments decreased in 2010 and 2009 by 42 billion and 111 billion respectively these changes are consistent with the changes in ge total costs and expenses 

ge cfoa decreased 17 billion compared with 2009 primarily reflecting a decrease in progress collections compared to 2009 in 2009 ge cfoa decreased 27 billion compared with 2008 primarily reflecting the lack of a dividend from gecs 24 billion 

dividends from gecs represented the distribution of a portion of gecs retained earnings and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses the amounts included in ge cfoa are the total dividends including normal dividends as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from gecs business sales beginning in the first quarter of 2009 gecs suspended its normal dividend to ge there were no special dividends received from gecs in 2010 2009 or 2008 

gecs cash flow 

gecs cash and equivalents were 603 billion at december 31 2010 compared with 626 billion at december 31 2009 gecs cash from operating activities totaled 212 billion in 2010 compared with 74 billion in 2009 this was primarily due to decreases compared to the prior year in net cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 69 billion in cash used for other liabilities of 15 billion higher currentyear earnings and lower gains and higher impairments at real estate of 29 billion 

consistent with our plan to reduce gecs asset levels cash from investing activities was 364 billion in 2010 primary sources were 263 billion resulting from a reduction in financing receivables primarily from collections exceeding originations a 18 billion reduction in investment securities and 16 billion of recoveries of financing receivables previously written off additionally we received proceeds of 25 billion from sales of discontinued operations primarily bac and 12 billion resulted from proceeds from business dispositions including the consumer businesses in hong kong and indonesia these sources were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions of 06 billion for the acquisition of certain financing businesses of the royal bank of scotland 

gecs cash used for financing activities in 2010 reflected our continued reduction in ending net investment cash used for financing activities of 596 billion related primarily to a 603 billion reduction in borrowings consisting primarily of reductions in longterm borrowings which includes reductions related to borrowings consolidated upon the adoption of asu 200916  17 and commercial paper partially offset by a 46 billion increase in bank deposits 

  

68 

gecs pays dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales beginning in the first quarter of 2009 gecs suspended its normal dividend to ge dividends paid to ge in 2008 were 24 billion there were no special dividends paid to ge in 2010 2009 or 2008 

intercompany eliminations 

effects of transactions between related companies are eliminated and consist primarily of gecs dividends to ge or capital contributions from ge to gecs ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs for further information related to intercompany eliminations see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

contractual obligations 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2010 follow 

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

  

 variable interest entities 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business to improve shareowner returns and as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions 

  

69 

the assets we securitize include receivables secured by equipment commercial real estate credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business the securitizations are funded with assetbacked commercial paper and term debt our securitization activities prior to january 1 2010 used qspes and were therefore not required to be consolidated 

on january 1 2010 we adopted asu 200916  17 asu 200916 eliminated the qspe concept and asu 200917 required that all such entities be evaluated for consolidation as variable interest entities vies adoption of these amendments resulted in the consolidation of all of our sponsored qspes in addition we consolidated assets of vies related to direct investments in entities that hold loans and fixed income securities a media joint venture and a small number of companies to which we have extended loans in the ordinary course of business and subsequently were subject to a tdr 

substantially all of our securitization vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary and qspes are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement 

we consolidated the assets and liabilities of these entities at amounts at which they would have been reported in our financial statements had we always consolidated them we also deconsolidated certain entities where we did not meet the definition of the primary beneficiary under the revised guidance however the effect was insignificant at january 1 2010 the incremental effect on total assets and liabilities net of our retained interests was an increase of 311 billion and 330 billion respectively at january 1 2010 the net reduction of total equity including noncontrolling interests was 19 billion at january 1 2010 principally related to the reversal of previously recognized securitization gains as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 

at december 31 2010 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 507 billion and 383 billion respectively an increase of 337 billion and 231 billion from 2009 respectively assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our onbook assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

at december 31 2009 prior to the effective date of asu 200916  17 our statement of financial position included 118 billion in retained interests in these entities related to the transferred financial assets discussed above these retained interests took two forms 1 sellers’ interests which were classified as financing receivables and 2 subordinated interests designed to provide credit enhancement to senior interests which were classified as investment securities the carrying value of our retained interests classified as financing receivables was 30 billion at december 31 2009 the carrying value of our retained interests classified as investment securities was 88 billion at december 31 2009 

at december 31 2010 investments in unconsolidated vies including our noncontrolling interest in ptl and investments in real estate entities were 126 billion an increase of 29 billion from 2009 primarily related to 17 billion of investments in entities whose status as a vie changed upon adoption of asu 200917 and 12 billion of additional investment in preexisting unconsolidated vies in addition to our existing investments we have contractual obligations to fund additional investments in the unconsolidated vies of 20 billion an increase of 06 billion from 2009 

we are party to various credit enhancement positions with securitization entities including liquidity and credit support agreements and guarantee and reimbursement contracts and have provided our best estimate of the fair value of estimated losses on such positions the estimate of fair value is based on prevailing market conditions at december 31 2010 should market conditions deteriorate actual losses could be higher our exposure to loss under such agreements was limited to 09 billion at december 31 2010 

we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie or qspe we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred financing receivables to any vie or qspe in either 2010 or 2009

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of losses depends on the size type and risk characteristics of the related financing receivable such an estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates writeoffs in both our consumer and commercial portfolios can also reflect both losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of a fiscal year and information becoming available during that fiscal year which may identify further deterioration on exposures existing prior to the beginning of that fiscal year and for which reserves could not have been previously recognized our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2010 increased earnings by 02 billion in 2009 and decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2008 we provide for probable losses when they become evident

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria effective april 1 2009 the fasb amended asc 320 and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring otherthantemporary impairment for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use quoted market prices when available our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals as appropriate 

our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in ge capital and is particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on management’s best estimate in determining its best estimate management evaluates average current market values obtained from third parties of similar type and age aircraft which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 04 billion and 01 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were insignificant and 01 billion in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 7 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments semiannually the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values as of our most recent estimate performed in 2010 the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 51 billion the estimated value of the portfolio continues to reflect deterioration in real estate values and market fundamentals including reduced market occupancy rates and market rents as well as the effects of limited real estate market liquidity given the current and expected challenging market conditions there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon cash flow estimates that reflect current and projected lease profiles and available industry information about capitalization rates and expected trends in rents and occupancy and is corroborated by external appraisals during 2010 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 23 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 08 billion in 2009 continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets results in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management and the all other assets section of this item and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach when available and appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results for purposes of the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 145 valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 

compared to the market approach the income approach more closely aligns each reporting unit valuation to our business profile including geographic markets served and product offerings required rates of return along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows are reflected in the selection of the discount rate equally important under this approach reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future states that may not be reflected in an observable market price a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples it can be somewhat more limited in its application because the population of potential comparables is often limited to publiclytraded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or nonpublic subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg synergies between the parties terms and conditions of the transaction etc may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business it can also be difficult under certain market conditions to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar businesses we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately 

  

73 

we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all of our reporting units in the third quarter using data as of july 1 2010 the impairment test consists of two steps in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value in step two which is applied when the carrying value is more than its fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill in performing the valuations we used cash flows that reflected management’s forecasts and discount rates that included risk adjustments consistent with the current market conditions based on the results of our step one testing the fair values of each of the ge industrial reporting units and the cll consumer energy financial services and gecas reporting units exceeded their carrying values therefore the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no goodwill impairment was recognized 

our real estate reporting unit had a goodwill balance of 11 billion at december 31 2010 as of july 1 2010 the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of our real estate reporting unit by approximately 32 billion the estimated fair value of the real estate reporting unit is based on a number of assumptions about future business performance and investment including loss estimates for the existing finance receivable and investment portfolio new debt origination volume and margins and anticipated stabilization of the real estate market allowing for sales of real estate investments at normalized margins our assumed discount rate was 12 and was derived by applying a capital asset pricing model and corroborated using equity analyst research reports and implied cost of equity based on forecasted price to earnings per share multiples for similar companies given the volatility and uncertainty in the current commercial real estate environment there is uncertainty about a number of assumptions upon which the estimated fair value is based different loss estimates for the existing portfolio changes in the new debt origination volume and margin assumptions changes in the expected pace of the commercial real estate market recovery or changes in the equity return expectation of market participants may result in changes in the estimated fair value of the real estate reporting unit 

based on the results of the step one testing we performed the second step of the impairment test described above based on the results of the second step analysis for the real estate reporting unit the estimated implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of goodwill by approximately 35 billion accordingly no goodwill impairment was required in the second step unrealized losses in an entity’s assets have the effect of increasing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill the results of the second step analysis were attributable to several factors the primary driver was the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of our real estate equity investments which approximated 63 billion at that time further information about the real estate investment portfolio is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – statement of financial position – all other assets of this item other drivers for the favorable outcome include the unrealized losses in the real estate finance receivable portfolio and the fair value premium on the real estate reporting unit allocated debt the results of the second step analysis are highly sensitive to these measurements as well as the key assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the real estate reporting unit 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results if current conditions persist longer or deteriorate further than expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense 

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 528 578 and 611 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth yields and spreads assets in our principal pension plans earned 135 in 2010 and had average annual earnings of 41 79 and 95 per year in the 10 15 and 25year periods ended december 31 2010 respectively these average historical returns were significantly affected by investment losses in 2008 based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and expected asset allocations we have assumed an 80 longterm expected return on those assets for cost recognition in 2011 this is a reduction from the 85 we had assumed in 2010 2009 and 2008 

changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans would have the following effects

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company at december 31 2010 94 billion of earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations because of the availability of us foreign tax credits it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 44 billion and 36 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively including 10 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances associated with losses reported in discontinued operations primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan such yearend 2010 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation as applicable 

at december 31 2010 derivative assets and liabilities were 75 billion and 28 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 9 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and longlived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investments and longlived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs 

a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the low end of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates

new accounting standards 

in september 2009 the fasb issued amendments to existing standards for revenue arrangements with multiple components asu 200913 requires the allocation of consideration to separate components based on the relative selling price of each component in a revenue arrangement asu 200914 requires certain softwareenabled products to be accounted for under the general accounting standards for multiple component arrangements as opposed to accounting standards specifically applicable to software arrangements the amendments are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january 1 2011 the impact of adopting these amendments is expected to be insignificant to our financial statements 

research and development 

gefunded research and development expenditures were 39 billion 33 billion and 31 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition research and development funding from customers principally the us government totaled 10 billion 11 billion and 13 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively technology infrastructure’s aviation business accounts for the largest share of ge’s research and development expenditures with funding from both ge and customer funds energy infrastructure’s energy business and technology infrastructure’s healthcare business also made significant expenditures funded primarily by ge 

expenditures reported above reflect the definition of research and development required by us generally accepted accounting principles for operating and management purposes we also measure amounts spent on product and services technology these technology expenditures were 59 billion in 2010 and included our reported research and development expenditures as well as the amount spent to improve our existing products and services and to improve productivity of our plants equipment and processes 

orders backlog 

ge’s total backlog of firm unfilled orders at the end of 2010 was 667 billion a decrease of 1 from yearend 2009 reflecting decreased demand at energy infrastructure partially offset by increased demand at technology infrastructure of this backlog 460 billion related to products of which 59 was scheduled for delivery in 2011 product services orders included in this reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months were 206 billion at the end of 2010 product services orders beyond the succeeding 12 months were approximately 1087 billion which combined with the firm unfilled orders described above resulted in a total backlog of approximately 1754 billion at december 31 2010 orders constituting backlog may be cancelled or deferred by customers subject in certain cases to penalties see the segment operations section of this item for further information 

supplemental information 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this form 10k report to 

 

  

  

  

   

78 

  

  

  

 the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

 we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as “industrial cfoa” which we define as ge’s cash from operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecs this includes the effects of intercompany transactions including ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge’s operating cash flows without the effect of gecs dividends since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services gecs cash flows we believe that our measure of industrial cfoa provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other nonfinancial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure 

 

   

79 

 we have provided segment revenues and profit excluding the revenues and earnings of our financial services segment ge capital which we refer to as “industrial revenues” and “industrial earnings” and excluding ge capital and our media business nbcu which we refer to as “infrastructure revenues” and “infrastructure earnings” we believe these are useful comparisons because they provide investors with information on the results of our industrial businesses with and without the nbcu business which is classified as a business held for sale at december 31 2010 we believe that these measures considered along with the corresponding gaap measures provide management and investors with additional information for comparison to other industrial businesses 

average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operationsa 

 

  

 

 

  our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings our calculation of average ge shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary

ratio of debt to equity at gecs net of cash and equivalents and with classification 

of hybrid debt as equity 

 

 ratio of debt to equity at gecc net of cash and equivalents and with classification 

of hybrid debt as equity 

 

 we have provided the gecs and gecc ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents to reduce debt and with longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace certain longterm debt with equity in the first quarter of 2009 ge made a 95 billion payment to gecs of which 88 billion was further contributed to gecc through capital contribution and share issuance despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses 

ge capital ending net investment eni excluding cash and equivalents 

 

   

81 

we use eni to measure the size of our ge capital segment we believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital debt or equity required to fund a business as it adjusts for noninterest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay we also believe that by excluding cash and equivalents we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our ge capital segment as a substantial amount of this cash and equivalents resulted from debt issuances to prefund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment 

ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding 

gecs earnings from continuing operations and the corresponding effective tax rates 

 

 reconciliation of us federal statutory income tax rate to ge 

effective tax rate excluding gecs earnings 

 

 we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecs net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecs tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 “business” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

  

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section and in the business descriptions in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report below we describe certain important operational and strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

  

our global growth is subject to economic and political risks 

 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world in 2009 approximately 54 of our revenues was attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of current market conditions 

  

we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that may change in significant ways 

 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies 

  

14 

  

there can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by making existing practices more restricted subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright in particular us and nonus governments are undertaking a substantial review and revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and nonbank financial institutions consumer lending the overthecounter derivatives market and tax laws and regulations which may have a significant effect on ge capital’s structure operations liquidity and performance we are also subject to a number of trade control laws and regulations that may affect our ability to sell our products in global markets in addition we are subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local capital requirements that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with nonus banks and other nonus financial institutions in global markets this provision which expired at the end of 2009 has been scheduled to expire and has been extended by congress on five previous occasions including in october of 2008 a oneyear extension was passed by the house of representatives in 2009 and the senate finance committee chairman and ranking member have indicated an intention to extend the provision for one year retroactive to the beginning of 2010 but there can be no assurance that it will be extended in the event the provision is not extended after 2009 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2010 the executive branch of the us government recently proposed the financial responsibility crisis fee which would require us to pay a fee at an annual rate of 15 basis points based on the amount of covered liabilities defined as assets less the sum of tier 1 capital and federal deposit insurance corporation fdicassessed deposits this proposal is at an early stage and its impact on the company if any will depend on a number of factors that are subject to congressional review and approval if adopted this fee could result in a reduction of our earnings going forward in addition the us government is currently considering broadbased legislation to change healthcare coverage that includes provisions for a fee on medical devices which could adversely affect the profitability of our healthcare business and increase the costs of providing healthcare to our employees furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in us and international economic stimulus programs which require us to comply with strict governmental regulations inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks we and our subsidiaries our businesses and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time

the success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions 

 

with respect to acquisitions and mergers we may not be able to identify suitable candidates at terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of various factors including integration challenges such as personnel and technology we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated even upon reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business we are subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms which may prevent us from completing the transaction for example we recently entered into an agreement with comcast corporation to transfer the assets of the nbcu business to a newly formed entity pursuant to which we will receive cash and will own a 49 interest in the newly formed entity the transaction is subject to receipt of various regulatory approvals in addition there is a risk that we may sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations in which case our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value 

  

sustained increases in costs of pension and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability 

 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we used to estimate pension income or expense for 2010 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plans assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated gains losses – net benefit plans at the end of 2009 the projected benefit obligation of our us principal pension plans was 481 billion and assets were 421 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans in addition upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to current employees and retirees may increase future funding obligations although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability

conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of ge capital’s funding 

 

a large portion of ge capital’s borrowings is in the form of commercial paper and longterm debt ge capital’s outstanding commercial paper and longterm debt was 42 billion and 399 billion as of december 31 2009 respectively while we have fully prefunded our planned 2010 longterm debt requirements we continue to rely on the availability of the unsecured debt markets to access funding for term maturities beyond 2010 in addition we rely on the availability of the commercial paper markets to refinance maturing shortterm commercial paper debt throughout the year in order to further diversify our funding sources we also plan to expand our reliance on alternative sources of funding including bank deposits securitizations and other assetbased funding there can be no assurance that we will succeed in diversifying our funding sources or that the short and longterm credit markets will be available or if available that the cost of funding will not substantially increase and affect the overall profitability of ge capital factors that may cause an increase in our funding costs include a decreased reliance on shortterm funding such as commercial paper in favor of longerterm funding arrangements refinancing of funding that we have obtained under the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp at market rates at the time such funding matures decreased capacity and increased competition among debt issuers and our credit ratings in effect at the time of refinancing if ge capital’s cost of funding were to increase it may adversely affect its competitive position and result in lower lending margins earnings and cash flows as well as lower returns on its shareowner’s equity and invested capital while we currently do not anticipate any equity offerings other sources of funding that involve the issuance of additional equity securities would be dilutive to our existing shareowners 

  

difficult conditions in the financial services markets have materially and adversely affected the business and results of operations of ge capital and these conditions may persist 

 

declines in the real estate markets increased payment defaults and foreclosures and sustained levels of high unemployment have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including ge capital if these conditions continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets including goodwill intangibles and tax assets in addition although we   have established allowances for losses in ge capital’s portfolio of financing receivables that we believe are adequate further deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase these allowances and writeoffs which depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our   business  financial position and results of operations to reduce ge’s exposure to volatile conditions in the financial markets and rebalance the relative size of its financial and industrial businesses we have decided to reduce the size of ge capital as measured by its ending net investment there can be no assurance that we will be able to timely execute on our reduction targets and failure to do so would result in greater exposure to financial markets than contemplated under our strategic funding plan or may result in the need for us to make additional contributions to ge capital 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect ge capital 

 

ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the collateral held cannot be realized upon sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to initial credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which are designed to limit credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations

the real estate markets in which ge capital participates are highly uncertain 

 

ge capital participates in the commercial real estate market in two ways it provides financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties and it also acquires equity positions in various types of properties the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the economic conditions in specific geographic markets in which the properties are located and the perceived value of those markets at the time of sale the level of transactions for real estate assets may vary significantly from one year to the next continued high levels of unemployment slowdown in business activity excess inventory capacity and limited availability of credit are expected to continue to adversely affect the value of real estate assets and collateral to real estate loans ge capital holds under current market and credit conditions there can be no assurance as to the level of sales ge capital will complete or the net sales proceeds it will realize also occupancy rates and market rentals may worsen which may result in impairments to the carrying value of equity investments or increases in the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans 

  

ge capital is also a residential mortgage lender in certain geographic markets outside the united states that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declines in real estate values and home sale volumes job losses consumer bankruptcies and other factors that may negatively impact the credit performance of our mortgage loans our allowance for loan losses on these mortgage loans is based on our analysis of current and historical delinquency and loan performance as well as other management assumptions that may be inaccurate predictions of credit performance in this environment there can be no assurance that in this environment credit performance will not be materially worse than anticipated and as a result materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

  

failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in march 2009 standard  poor’s sp downgraded ge and ge capital’s longterm rating by one notch from “aaa” to “aa” and at the same time revised the outlook from negative to stable in addition moody’s investors service moody’s downgraded ge and ge capital’s longterm rating by two notches from “aaa” to “aa2” with a stable outlook the shortterm ratings of “a1p1” were affirmed by both rating agencies at the same time with respect to ge ge capital services and ge capital there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade which depending on the extent of the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position 

  

18 

  

current conditions in the global economy and the major industries we serve also may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our nonfinancial businesses 

 

the business and operating results of our technology infrastructure energy infrastructure consumer and industrial and media businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions including conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare media and other major industries we serve as a result of slowing global economic growth the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence increased unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures fluctuating commodity prices bankruptcies and other challenges currently affecting the global economy some of our customers have experienced deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion in particular the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and international economies a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally that continues to result in the loss of business and leisure traffic could have a material adverse effect on our airline customers and the viability of their business service contract cancellations could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us if the global economic slowdown continues for a significant period or there is significant further deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

we are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and product innovations for continued revenue growth 

 

the markets in which we operate are subject to technological change our longterm operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative products to modify existing products to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements there are numerous risks inherent in this process including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 

our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours and we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses 

 

our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology in addition we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties including nonpracticing entities regardless of the merit of such claims responding to infringement claims can be expensive and timeconsuming if ge is found to infringe any thirdparty rights we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms 

significant raw material shortages supplier capacity constraints supplier production disruptions supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers and service providers and commodity markets to secure raw materials parts components and subsystems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials parts components systems and services a disruption in deliveries from our thirdparty suppliers contract manufacturers or service providers capacity constraints production disruptions price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs quality issues experienced by thirdparty providers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm 

  

19 

  

there are risks inherent in owning our common stock 

 

the market price and volume of our common stock have been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these may arise from general stock market conditions the impact of the risk factors described above on our financial condition and results of operations a change in sentiment in the market regarding us or our business prospects or from other factors changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect the value of our common stock

overview of our earnings from 2007 through 2009

energy infrastructure 21 and 24 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively has grown significantly over the last several years as the worldwide demand for energy and for alternative sources of power such as wind and thermal rose to new levels revenues decreased 4 in 2009 after increasing 26 in 2008 and segment profit increased 13 and 26 in 2009 and 2008 respectively we continue to invest in marketleading technology and services at energy and oil  gas

we declared 68 billion in dividends in 2009 common pershare dividends of 061 were down 51 from 2008 following an 8 increase from the preceding year in february 2009 we announced the reduction of the quarterly ge stock dividend by 68 from 031 per share to 010 per share effective with the dividend approved by the board in june 2009 which was paid in the third quarter this reduction had the effect of reducing cash outflows of the company by approximately 4 billion in the second half of 2009 and will save approximately 9 billion annually thereafter on february 12 2010 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 010 per share of common stock which is payable april 26 2010 to shareowners of record at close of business on march 1 2010 in 2009 we declared 03 billion in preferred stock dividends compared with 01 billion in 2008 

except as otherwise noted the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of ge with gecs included on a oneline basis and gecs see the segment operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within ge and gecs 

ge sales of product services were 354 billion in 2009 about flat compared with 2008 increases in product services at energy infrastructure were offset by decreases at technology infrastructure and consumer  industrial operating profit from product services was 100 billion in 2009 up 7 from 2008 

postretirement benefit plans costs were 26 billion 22 billion and 26 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively costs increased in 2009 primarily because of the effects of lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 634 at december 31 2007 to 611 at december 31 2008 and increases in early retirements resulting from restructuring activities and contractual requirements partially offset by amortization of prioryears investment gains and benefits from new healthcare supplier contracts costs decreased in 2008 primarily because of the effects of prior years investment gains higher discount rates and benefits from new healthcare supplier contracts partially offset by additional costs of plan benefits resulting from union negotiations and a pensioner increase in 2007 

considering the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 85 for cost recognition in 2010 the same level as we assumed in 2009 2008 and 2007 gaap provides recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits excluding the effects of 2009 restructuring activities to increase in 2010 by approximately 10 billion as compared to 2009 primarily because of the effects of prioryear investment losses and lower discount rates

our principal pension plans were underfunded by 60 billion at the end of 2009 as compared to 44 billion at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 the ge pension plan was underfunded by 22 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 38 billion the increase in underfunding from yearend 2008 was primarily attributable to lower discount rates principal pension plans discount rate decreased from 611 at december 31 2008 to 578 at december 31 2009 which increased the pension benefit obligation at yearend 2009 by approximately 17 billion our principal pension plans’ assets increased from 407 billion at the end of 2008 to 421 billion at december 31 2009 a 100 increase in investment values during the year partially offset by benefit payments assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations 

on an employee retirement income security act erisa basis the ge pension plan remains fully funded at january 1 2010 we will not make any contributions to the ge pension plan in 2010 assuming our 2010 actual experience is consistent with our current benefit assumptions eg expected return on assets and interest rates we will not be required to make contributions to the ge pension plan in 2011 

at december 31 2009 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 27 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2008 was 24 billion we expect to contribute 06 billion to our other pension plans in 2010 compared with actual contributions of 07 billion and 06 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis the unfunded liability for our principal retiree health and life plans was 116 billion and 108 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively this increase was primarily attributable to lower discount rates retiree health and life plans discount rate decreased from 615 at december 31 2008 to 567 at december 31 2009 which increased the unfunded liability by approximately 06 billion we expect to contribute 07 billion to these plans in 2010 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion in 2009 and 2008 

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses these costs were 143 129 and 142 of total ge sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 188 billion 262 billion and 238 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 179 billion 251 billion and 227 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively gecs average borrowings declined from 2008 to 2009 after increasing from 2007 to 2008 in line with changes in average gecs assets interest rates have decreased over the threeyear period attributable to declining global benchmark interest rates partially offset by higher average credit spreads gecs average borrowings were 4992 billion 5212 billion and 4564 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the gecs average composite effective interest rate was 36 in 2009 48 in 2008 and 50 in 2007 in 2009 gecs average assets of 6496 billion were 3 lower than in 2008 which in turn were 13 higher than in 2007 we anticipate that gecs composite effective rates will begin to rise in 2010 as benchmark rates begin to rise globally see the liquidity and borrowings section for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions

income taxes benefit on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 105 in 2009 compared with 53 in 2008 and 151 in 2007 our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the use of global funding structures and our 2009 and 2008 decisions to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us 

our consolidated income tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily because of a reduction during 2009 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of our tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations including the decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us these effects were partially offset by a decrease from 2008 to 2009 in the benefit from lowertaxed earnings from global operations 

cash taxes paid in 2009 were 25 billion reflecting the effects of changes to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases including the decision discussed below to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us 

our consolidated income tax rate decreased from 2007 to 2008 primarily because of a reduction during 2008 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations on the tax rate in addition earnings from lowertaxed global operations increased from 2007 to 2008 the increase in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations includes a benefit from the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us because the use of foreign tax credits no longer required the repatriation of those prioryear earnings 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecs and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

because ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings excluding gecs ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecs earnings from continuing operations were 126 billion 142 billion and 135 billion for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 218 in 2009 242 in 2008 and 206 in 2007 

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 

the ge effective tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009 primarily because of the 36 percentage point increase in the benefit from lowertaxed earnings from global operations excluding audit resolutions 

   

the ge effective tax rate increased from 2007 to 2008 because of the 43 percentage point lower 2008 benefit from favorable audit resolutions partially offset by a 12 percentage point increase in the benefit in lowertaxed earnings from global operations excluding audit resolutions 

the 2007 ge rate reflects the favorable audit resolutions shown above and the benefit of lowertaxed earnings from global operations 

  

30 

  

the gecs effective tax rate was 1734 in 2009 compared with 422 in 2008 and 97 in 2007 ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return that enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecs effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions ge makes cash payments to gecs for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due 

comparing a tax benefit to pretax income resulted in a negative gecs tax rate in 2008 and comparing a tax benefit to pretax loss results in the positive gecs tax rate in 2009 the gecs tax rate increased from 2008 to 2009 primarily because of a reduction during 2009 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this had the effect of increasing the relative impact on the rate of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations increasing the rate 2532 percentage points this more than offset the decline in those benefits decreasing the rate 681 percentage points the decline in tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations includes an offset of 159 percentage points for increased benefits from management’s decision discussed below in 2009 to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us that was larger than the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us 

during 2009 following the change in our external credit ratings funding actions taken and our continued review of our operations liquidity and funding we determined that undistributed prioryear earnings of nonus subsidiaries of gecs on which we had previously provided deferred us taxes would now be indefinitely reinvested outside the us this change increased the amount of prioryear earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the us by approximately 2 billion resulting in an income tax benefit of 07 billion in 2009 

the gecs rate decreased from 2007 to 2008 primarily because of a reduction during 2008 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations on the tax rate reducing the rate 308 percentage points in addition earnings from lowertaxed global operations increased from 2007 to 2008 causing an additional 199 percentage point rate reduction the increase in the benefit from lower taxed global operations includes 62 percentage points from the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest prioryear earnings outside the us because the use of foreign tax credits no longer required the repatriation of those prioryear earnings 

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization such as ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated we evaluate risk at the individual transaction level and evaluate aggregate risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

the ge board of directors board has overall responsibility for risk oversight with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company at the end of each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to prioritize in the next year throughout the year the board and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail strategic and operational risks are presented and discussed in the context of the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings and at presentations to the board and its committees by the vice chairmen general counsel and other officers the board has delegated responsibility for the oversight of specific risks to board committees as follows 

  

31 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ge board’s risk oversight process builds upon management’s risk assessment and mitigation processes which include standardized reviews of longterm strategic and operational planning executive development and evaluation regulatory and litigation compliance health safety and environmental compliance financial reporting and controllership and information technology and security in august 2009 ge appointed a chief risk officer cro with responsibility for overseeing and coordinating risk assessment and mitigation on an enterprisewide basis the cro leads the corporate risk function and is responsible for the identification of key business risks ensuring appropriate management of these risks within stated limits and enforcement through policies and procedures management has two committees to further assist it in assessing and mitigating risk the policy compliance review board pcrb meets between 12 and 14 times a year is chaired by the company’s general counsel and includes the chief financial officer and other senior level functional leaders it has principal responsibility for monitoring compliance matters across the company the corporate risk committee crc meets at least four times a year is chaired by the cro and comprises the chairman and ceo and other senior level business and functional leaders it has principal responsibility for evaluating and addressing risks escalated to the cro and corporate risk function and also reports to the board on risk 

ges corporate risk function leverages the risk infrastructures in each of our businesses which have adopted an approach that corresponds to the company’s overall risk policies guidelines and review mechanisms our risk infrastructure is designed to identify evaluate and mitigate risks within each of the following categories 

  

32 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks identified through our risk management processes are prioritized and depending on the probability and severity of the risk escalated to the cro the cro in coordination with the crc assigns responsibility of the risks to the business or functional leader most suited to manage the risk assigned owners are required to continually monitor evaluate and report on risks for which they bear responsibility we have general response strategies for managing risks which categorize risks according to whether the company will avoid transfer reduce or accept the risk these response strategies are tailored to ensure that risks are within acceptable ge board tolerance levels 

depending on the nature of the risk involved and the particular business or function affected we use a wide variety of risk mitigation strategies including hedging standardized processes approvals and operating reviews insurance and strategic planning reviews as a matter of policy we generally hedge the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices our service businesses employ a comprehensive tollgate process leading up to and through the execution of a contractual service agreement to mitigate legal financial and operational risks furthermore we centrally manage certain risks through insurance determined by the balance between the level of risk retained or assumed and the cost of transferring risk to others we counteract the risk of fluctuations in economic activity and customer demand by monitoring industry dynamics and responding accordingly including by adjusting capacity implementing cost reductions and engaging in mergers and acquisitions 

gecs risk management and oversight 

 

gecs has developed a robust risk infrastructure and processes to manage risks related to its businesses and the ge corporate risk function relies upon them in fulfillment of its mission as discussed above the ge audit committee oversees gecs’ risk assessment and management processes 

at the gecs level the gecs board of directors oversees the gecs risk management process and approves all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as significant borrowings and investments all participants in the gecs risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the gecs board 

  

33 

  

ge capital has established an enterprise risk management committee ermc comprising the most senior leaders in ge capital which has oversight responsibility for identifying assessing mitigating and monitoring risk across the entire ge capital enterprise including credit market operational legal  compliance liquidity and funding risk ge capital in coordination with and under the oversight of the ge cro provides comprehensive risk reports to the ge audit committee at these meetings which will occur at least four times a year ge capital senior management will focus on the risk strategy and financial services portfolio including the risk oversight processes used to manage all the elements of risk managed by the ermc 

ge capitals risk management approach rests upon three major tenets a broad spread of risk based on managed exposure limits senior secured commercial financings and a hold to maturity model with transactions underwritten to “onbook” standards 

dedicated risk professionals across the businesses include underwriters portfolio managers collectors environmental and engineering specialists and specialized asset managers who evaluate leased asset residuals and remarket offlease equipment the senior risk officers have on average over 25 years of experience

segment operations 

 

our five segments are focused on the broad markets they serve energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal capital finance and consumer  industrial in addition to providing information on segments in their entirety we have also provided supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments for greater clarity 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses inprocess research and development and certain other acquisitionrelated charges and balances technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team 

   

segment profit always excludes the effects of principal pension plans results reported as discontinued operations earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal and consumer  industrial included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for capital finance

real estate 2009 revenues decreased 40 and net earnings decreased 27 billion compared with 2008 revenues in 2009 decreased 26 billion compared with 2008 as a result of organic revenue declines 24 billion primarily as a result of a decrease in sales of properties and the stronger us dollar 02 billion real estate net earnings decreased 27 billion compared with 2008 primarily from an increase in provisions for losses on financing receivables and impairments 12 billion and a decrease in gains on sales of properties as compared to the prior period 11 billion depreciation expense on real estate equity investments totaled 12 billion in both 2009 and 2008 in the normal course of our business operations we sell certain real estate equity investments when it is economically advantageous for us to do so 

real estate assets at december 31 2009 decreased 38 billion or 4 from december 31 2008 including 27 billion or 6 attributable to a decline in real estate lending reflecting lower originations principal repayments and increased loan reserves and 07 billion or 2 attributable to a decline in real estate investments principally due to depreciation expense and impairments partially offset by foreclosures during 2009 we sold real estate equity investment assets with a book value totaling 15 billion which resulted in net earnings of 01 billion that were more than offset by losses impairments and depreciation

corporate items and eliminations include the effects of eliminating transactions between operating segments results of our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations certain items in our treasury operations cost of and cost reductions from our principal pension plans underabsorbed corporate overhead certain nonallocated amounts described below and a variety of sundry items corporate items and eliminations is not an operating segment rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to consolidated totals on the financial statements 

certain amounts included in corporate items and eliminations cost are not allocated to ge operating segments because they are excluded from the measurement of their operating performance for internal purposes in 2009 these included 04 billion at each of capital finance and technology infrastructure 02 billion at energy infrastructure and 01 billion at consumer  industrial primarily for restructuring rationalization and other charges and 03 billion at nbc universal primarily for restructuring rationalization and other charges and technology and product development costs in 2008 amounts primarily related to restructuring rationalization and other charges were 05 billion at each of capital finance and nbc universal 04 billion at technology infrastructure and 03 billion at each of energy infrastructure and consumer  industrial included in these amounts in 2008 were technology and product development costs of 02 billion at nbc universal and 01 billion at technology infrastructure and net losses on business exits of 02 billion at capital finance gecs amounts are on an aftertax basis

corporate items and eliminations include the elimination of transactions between our segments in 2007 revenues eliminations and other included a 09 billion gain on sale of a business interest to hitachi by the energy business and a 06 billion gain on sale of swiss re common stock 

in 2009 other operating profit cost increased 10 billion primarily due to a 11 billion increase in restructuring and other charges which included a 06 billion increase in costs related to environmental remediation matters 

in 2007 other operating profit cost reflected a 09 billion gain on sale of a business interest to hitachi by the energy business and a 03 billion aftertax basis gain on sale of swiss re common stock 

 

discontinued operations primarily comprised ge money japan wmc and plastics results of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

during the third quarter of 2007 we committed to a plan to sell our lake business and recorded an aftertax loss of 09 billion which represents the difference between the net book value of our lake business and the projected sale price during 2008 we completed the sale of ge money japan which included lake along with our japanese mortgage and card businesses excluding our minority ownership interest in ge nissen credit co ltd in connection with this sale and primarily related to our japanese mortgage and card businesses we recorded an incremental 04 billion loss in 2008 

   

in december 2007 we completed the sale of our wmc business for 01 billion in cash recognizing an aftertax loss of 01 billion in connection with the transaction certain contractual obligations and potential liabilities related to previously sold loans were retained 

in august 2007 we completed the sale of our plastics business to saudi basic industries corporation for 116 billion in cash as a result we recognized an aftertax gain of 16 billion 

loss from discontinued operations net of taxes in 2009 primarily reflected the incremental loss on disposal of ge money japan 01 billion

geographic operations 

 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new profit opportunities potential increased risks include among other things higher receivable delinquencies and bad debts delays or cancellations of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment higher local currency financing costs and slowdown in established financial services activities new profit opportunities include among other things more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas we classify certain operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose 

 

global revenues decreased 13 to 843 billion in 2009 compared with 972 billion and 863 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 54 in 2009 compared with 53 and 50 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were to decrease revenues by 39 billion in 2009 and increase revenues by 20 billion and 40 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

ge global revenues in 2009 were 564 billion down 5 over 2008 increases in emerging markets of 25 in eastern europe 16 in china and 3 in africa were more than offset by decreases of 17 in the americas and 7 in western europe ge global revenues as a percentage of total ge revenues were 55 in 2009 compared with 53 and 50 in 2008 and 2007 respectively ge global revenues were 594 billion in 2008 up 19 over 2007 with broadbased global growth 

gecs global revenues decreased 26 to 279 billion in 2009 compared with 378 billion and 365 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively primarily as a result of dispositions in europe and the pacific basin gecs global revenues as a percentage of total gecs revenues were 52 in 2009 compared with 53 and 51 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were to decrease revenues by 25 billion in 2009 and increase revenues by 12 billion and 23 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively

total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were 3911 billion in 2009 a decrease of 93 billion or 2 from 2008 gecs global assets on a continuing basis of 3191 billion at the end of 2009 were 3 lower than at the end of 2008 reflecting core declines in the pacific basin and europe partially offset by acquisitions and the effects of the weaker us dollar primarily at consumer and cll 

financial results of our global activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a sizeable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 03 billion in both 2009 and 2008 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures of about 04 billion over the next two years 

in november 2006 the united states federal district court approved a consent decree which had been agreed to by ge and the united states environmental protection agency epa that represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of epas 2002 record of decision to dredge polychlorinated biphenyl pcbcontaining sediments in the upper hudson river under the consent degree the dredging is to be performed in two phases and phase i was completed in may through november of 2009 between phase i and phase ii there will be an intervening peer review by an independent panel of national experts the panel will evaluate the performance of phase i dredging operations with respect to phase i engineering performance standards evaluate experience gained from phase i and may set forth proposed changes to the standards this evaluation is expected to conclude in the summer of 2010 after which epa considering the peer review panels recommendations ges proposed changes and its own analysis will issue its regulatory decision setting forth any changes to the scope of or performance standards for phase ii following epas decision ge has 90 days to either elect to perform phase ii or to opt out of the project at which point ge may be responsible for further costs our statement of financial position as of december 31 2009 included liabilities for the probable and estimable costs of the project under the consent decree

statement of financial position 

 

because ge and gecs share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position – property plant and equipment and borrowings for example – the following discussion addresses significant captions in the “consolidated” statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecs activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

investment securities comprise mainly investmentgrade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations and holders of guaranteed investment contracts gics and retained interests in securitization entities the fair value of investment securities increased to 519 billion at december 31 2009 from 414 billion at december 31 2008 primarily driven by decreases in unrealized losses due to market improvements investment of cash into shortterm investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposits and an increase in our retained interests in securitization entities of the amount at december 31 2009 we held debt securities with an estimated fair value of 417 billion which included corporate debt securities residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs with estimated fair values of 255 billion 33 billion and 27 billion respectively unrealized losses on debt securities were 26 billion and 54 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively this amount included unrealized losses on corporate debt securities rmbs and cmbs of 08 billion 08 billion and 04 billion respectively at december 31 2009 as compared with 26 billion 11 billion and 08 billion respectively at december 31 2008 

of the 33 billion of rmbs our exposure to subprime credit was approximately 09 billion these securities are primarily held to support obligations to holders of gics we purchased no such securities in 2009 and 2008 these investment securities are collateralized primarily by pools of individual direct mortgage loans and do not include structured products such as collateralized debt obligations additionally a majority of exposure to residential subprime credit related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 

the vast majority of our cmbs have investmentgrade credit ratings from the major rating agencies and are in a senior position in the capital structure of the deal our cmbs investments are collateralized by both diversified pools of mortgages that were originated for securitization conduit cmbs and pools of large loans backed by high quality properties large loan cmbs a majority of which were originated in 2006 and 2007 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment our review uses both qualitative and quantitative criteria effective april 1 2009 the fasb amended asc 320 investments – debt and equity securities  and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring otherthantemporary impairment for debt securities this did not have a material impact on our results of operations we presently do not intend to sell our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows with respect to corporate bonds we placed greater emphasis on the credit quality of the issuer with respect to rmbs and cmbs we placed greater emphasis on our expectations with respect to cash flows from the underlying collateral and with respect to rmbs we considered other features of the security principally monoline insurance for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers

monoline insurers monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities the credit enhancement is a feature of each specific security that guarantees the payment of all contractual cash flows and is not purchased separately by ge at december 31 2009 our investment securities insured by monolines totaled 27 billion including 08 billion of our 09 billion investment in subprime rmbs the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities in evaluating whether a security with monoline credit enhancement is otherthantemporarily impaired we first evaluate whether there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows if there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows we then evaluate the overall credit worthiness of the monoline using an analysis that is similar to the approach we use for corporate bonds this includes an evaluation of the following factors sufficiency of the monoline’s cash reserves and capital ratings activity whether the monoline is in default or default appears imminent and the potential for intervention by an insurance or other regulator at december 31 2009 the unrealized loss associated with securities subject to monoline credit enhancement for which there is an expected loss was 03 billion of which 02 billion relates to expected credit losses and the remaining 01 billion relates to other market factors 

total pretax otherthantemporary impairment losses during the period april 1 2009 through december 31 2009 were 08 billion of which 05 billion was recognized in earnings and primarily relates to credit losses on corporate debt securities rmbs and retained interests in our securitization arrangements and 03 billion primarily relates to noncredit related losses on rmbs and is included within accumulated other comprehensive income 

our qualitative review attempts to identify issuers’ securities that are “atrisk” of otherthantemporary impairment that is for securities that we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery of our amortized cost whether there is a possibility of credit loss that would result in an otherthantemporary impairment recognition in the following 12 months securities we have identified as “atrisk” primarily relate to investments in rmbs securities and corporate debt securities across a broad range of industries the amount of associated unrealized loss on these securities at december 31 2009 is 06 billion credit losses that would be recognized in earnings are calculated when we determine the security to be otherthantemporarily impaired continued uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments 

at december 31 2009 unrealized losses on investment securities totaled 26 billion including 24 billion aged 12 months or longer compared with unrealized losses of 57 billion including 35 billion aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2008 of the amount aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2009 more than 70 of our debt securities were considered to be investment grade by the major rating agencies in addition of the amount aged 12 months or longer 15 billion and 07 billion related to structured securities mortgagebacked assetbacked and securitization retained interests and corporate debt securities respectively with respect to our investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2009 the vast majority relate to debt securities held to support obligations to holders of gics and annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations we presently do not intend to sell our debt securities and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities that are in an unrealized loss position before recovery of our amortized cost the fair values used to determine these unrealized gains and losses are those defined by relevant accounting standards and are not a forecast of future gains or losses for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k report 

fair value measurements  we adopted asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  in two steps effective january 1 2008 we adopted it for all financial instruments and nonfinancial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and effective january 1 2009 for all nonfinancial instruments accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis adoption of this did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations additional information about our application of this guidance is provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

investments   measured at fair value in earnings include retained interests in securitizations accounted for at fair value and equity investments of 31 billion at yearend 2009 the earnings effects of changes in fair value on these assets favorable and unfavorable will be reflected in the period in which those changes occur as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report we also have assets that are classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business primarily credit card receivables loans and real estate properties carried at 37 billion at yearend 2009 which represents the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell to the extent that the estimated fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value any favorable or unfavorable changes in fair value will be reflected in earnings in the period in which such changes occur 

   

working capital  representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections was 16 billion at december 31 2009 down 55 billion from december 31 2008 primarily reflecting the effects of operating initiatives and the classification of nbcu and our security business as held for sale as energy delivers units out of its backlog over the next few years progress collections of 130 billion at december 31 2009 will be earned which along with progress collections on new orders will impact working capital throughout the last three years we have executed a significant number of initiatives through our operating council such as lean cycle time projects which have resulted in working capital decreases we expect to continue these initiatives in 2010 which should have the effect of significantly offsetting the effects of decreases in progress collections 

we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

current receivables for ge totaled to 98 billion at the end of 2009 and 151 billion at the end of 2008 and included 75 billion due from customers at the end of 2009 compared with 113 billion at the end of 2008 ge current receivables turnover including nbcu was 80 in 2009 compared with 75 in 2008 the overall reduction in current receivables was due to the operating council initiatives and lower volume across our industrial businesses and the classification of nbcu and our security business as held for sale see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

inventories for ge totaled to 119 billion at december 31 2009 down 17 billion from the end of 2008 this decrease reflected lower inventories at technology infrastructure and the classification of our security business and nbcu as held for sale partially offset by higher inventories at energy infrastructure supporting the significant backlog ge inventory turnover including nbcu was 79 and 80 in 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows 

our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks historically we have had less consumer exposure which over time has had higher loss rates than commercial exposure 

our consumer portfolio is largely nonus and primarily comprises mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries our us consumer financing receivables comprise 7 of our total portfolio of those approximately 36 relate primarily to credit cards which are often subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements with the retailer the results of which are reflected in gecs revenues and have a smaller average balance and lower loss severity as compared to bank cards the remaining 64 are sales finance receivables which provide electronics recreation medical and home improvement financing to customers in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans 

  

47 

  

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes including industrialrelated facilities and equipment commercial and residential real estate vehicles aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation telecommunications and healthcare industries we are in a secured position for substantially all of this portfolio 

overall we believe that the global economic markets are beginning to stabilize and we expect that our financing receivables portfolio will begin to reflect this over the course of 2010 we believe that the commercial financing markets in which we operate excluding commercial real estate discussed below are likewise becoming more stable and loss severity remains within an expected range delinquency and nonearnings rates in these businesses are beginning to show signs of improvement and originations while down are at generally higher margins in our consumer businesses we continued throughout 2009 to raise underwriting standards reduce open credit commitments and maintain discipline in collections the performance of this business has historically been linked to the global economy and unemployment levels and we expect 2010 losses to be about the same as our experience in 2009 real estate continues to be under pressure with limited market liquidity and challenging economic conditions we have and continue to maintain an intense focus on operations and risk management however we expect current economic conditions to persist in 2010 which will likely result in higher losses for real estate compared with 2009 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio such estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values including housing price indices as applicable and the present and expected future levels of interest rates our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate effective january 1 2009 loans acquired in a business acquisition are recorded at fair value which incorporates our estimate at the acquisition date of the credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio as a result the allowance for loan losses is not carried over at acquisition this may result in lower reserve coverage ratios prospectively 

for purposes of the discussion that follows “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due based on their contractual terms and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful nonearning receivables exclude loans purchased at a discount unless they have deteriorated post acquisition under asc 310 receivables these loans are initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan based on reasonably estimable cash flows even if the underlying loans are contractually delinquent at acquisition in addition nonearning receivables exclude loans that are paying currently under a cash accounting basis but classified as impaired recently restructured financing receivables are not considered delinquent when payments are brought current according to the restructured terms but may remain classified as nonearning until there has been a period of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower and future payments are reasonably assured of collection

further information on the determination of the allowance for losses on financing receivables is provided in the critical accounting estimates section of this item and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 3450 billion at december 31 2009 and 3778 billion at december 31 2008 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 328 billion from december 31 2008 primarily as a result of core declines of 521 billion mainly from collections exceeding originations 440 billion which includes securitization and sales partially offset by the weaker us dollar 178 billion and acquisitions 119 billion 

related nonearning receivables totaled 133 billion 38 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2009 compared with 80 billion 21 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2008 nonearning receivables increased from december 31 2008 primarily in connection with the challenging global economic environment increased deterioration in the real estate markets and rising unemployment 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2009 totaled 81 billion compared with 53 billion at december 31 2008 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and reflecting the thencurrent credit and economic environment allowance for losses increased 28 billion from december 31 2008 primarily due to increasing delinquencies and nonearning receivables reflecting the continued weakened economic and credit environment

“impaired” loans in the table below are defined as larger balance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement the vast majority of our consumer and a portion of our cll nonearning receivables are excluded from this definition as they represent smaller balance homogenous loans that we evaluate collectively by portfolio for impairment 

impaired loans include nonearning receivables on larger balance or restructured loans loans which are currently paying interest under the cash basis but are excluded from the nonearning category and loans paying currently but which have been previously restructured 

specific reserves are recorded for individually impaired loans to the extent we judge principal to be uncollectible certain loans classified as impaired may not require a reserve in these circumstances we believe that we will ultimately collect the unpaid balance through collection or collateral repossession 

further information pertaining to loans classified as impaired and specific reserves is included in the table below 

 

 

 

impaired loans increased by 93 billion from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 primarily relating to increases at real estate 57 billion and cll 27 billion we regularly review our real estate loans for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors such as debt service coverage and loantovalue ratios we classify real estate loans as impaired when the most recent valuation reflects a projected loantovalue ratio at maturity in excess of 100 even if the loan is currently paying in accordance with contractual terms the increase in impaired loans and related specific reserves at real estate reflects our current estimate of collateral values of the underlying properties and our estimate of loans which are not past due but for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect the full principal balance at maturity due to a decline in the underlying value of the collateral of our 65 billion impaired loans at real estate at december 31 2009 approximately 44 billion are currently paying in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan impaired loans at cll primarily represent senior secured lending positions

delinquency rates 

 

delinquency rates on managed equipment financing loans and leases and managed consumer financing receivables follow 

 

delinquency rates on equipment financing loans and leases increased from december 31 2008 and 2007 to december 31 2009 as a result of the continuing weakness in the global economic and credit environment in addition delinquency rates on equipment financing loans and leases increased nine basis points from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 as a result of the inclusion of the citicapital acquisition the challenging credit environment may continue to lead to a higher level of commercial delinquencies and provisions for financing receivables and could adversely affect results of operations at cll 

delinquency rates on consumer financing receivables increased from december 31 2008 and 2007 to december 31 2009 primarily because of rising unemployment a challenging economic environment and lower volume in response we continued to tighten underwriting standards globally increased focus on collection effectiveness and will continue the process of regularly reviewing and adjusting reserve levels we expect the global environment along with us unemployment levels to further show signs of stabilization in 2010 however a continued challenging economic environment may continue to result in higher provisions for loan losses and could adversely affect results of operations at consumer at december 31 2009 roughly 39 of our us managed portfolio excluding delinquent or impaired which consisted of credit cards installment and revolving loans was receivable from subprime borrowers we had no us subprime residential mortgage loans at december 31 2009 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other gecs receivables totaled 188 billion at december 31 2009 and 186 billion at december 31 2008 and consisted primarily of amounts due from ge generally related to material procurement programs of 25 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively amounts due from qualified special purpose entities qspes insurance receivables nonfinancing customer receivables amounts accrued from investment income amounts due under operating leases and various sundry items 

property plant and equipment totaled 692 billion at december 31 2009 down 93 billion from 2008 primarily reflecting the deconsolidation of ptl and the classification of nbcu and our security business as held for sale ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecs was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

ge additions to property plant and equipment totaled 24 billion and 30 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively total expenditures excluding equipment leased to others for the past five years were 139 billion of which 38 was investment for growth through new capacity and product development 28 was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements and 34 was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection 

 

gecs additions to property plant and equipment were 64 billion and 133 billion during 2009 and 2008 respectively primarily reflecting acquisitions and additions of commercial aircraft at the gecas business of capital finance 

  

54 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 656 billion and 119 billion respectively at december 31 2009 goodwill decreased 162 billion from 2008 primarily from dispositions including the classification of nbcu and our security business as held for sale and the ptl deconsolidation partially offset by the effects of the weaker us dollar and acquisitions including bac and interbanca spa by capital finance and airfoils technologies international – singapore pte ltd ati – singapore at technology infrastructure other intangible assets decreased 30 billion from 2008 primarily from dispositions and amortization expense see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

all other assets totaled 1034 billion at december 31 2009 a decrease of 35 billion reflecting the classification of nbcu as held for sale and decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments partially offset by a 58 billion equity method investment in ptl following our partial sale in the first quarter of 2009 and increases in contract costs and estimated earnings we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of cost and equity method investments of 09 billion and 05 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

included in other assets are real estate equity investments of 322 billion and 328 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market value throughout the year these markets have been increasingly affected by rising unemployment a slowdown in general business activity and continued challenging conditions in the credit markets we expect these markets will continue to be affected while the economic environment remains challenging 

   

we review the estimated values of our commercial real estate investments semiannually as of our most recent estimate performed in 2009 the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 7 billion the estimated value of the portfolio reflects the continued deteriorating real estate values and market fundamentals including reduced market occupancy rates and market rents as well as the effects of limited real estate market liquidity given the current and expected challenging market conditions there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values and our unrealized loss on real estate equity properties may continue to increase declines in estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon current market data including current capitalization rates during 2009 real estate recognized pretax impairments of 08 billion in its real estate investments compared with 03 billion for the comparable period in 2008 continued deterioration in economic and market conditions may result in further impairments being recognized 

contract costs and estimated earnings reflect revenues earned in excess of billings on our longterm contracts to construct technically complex equipment such as power generation aircraft engines and aeroderivative units and longterm product maintenance or extended warranty arrangements our total contract costs and estimated earnings balances at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 74 billion and 60 billion respectively reflecting the timing of billing in relation to work performed as well as changes in estimates of future revenues and costs our total contract costs and estimated earnings balance at december 31 2009 primarily related to customers in our energy aviation and transportation businesses further information is provided in the critical accounting estimates section of this item 

liquidity and borrowings 

 

we manage our liquidity to help ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles our obligations include principal payments on outstanding borrowings interest on borrowings purchase obligations for inventory and equipment and general obligations such as collateral deposits held or collateral required to be posted to counterparties payroll and general expenses we rely on cash generated through our operating activities as well as unsecured and secured funding sources including commercial paper term debt bank borrowings securitization and other retail funding products 

   

  

55 

  

sources for payment of our obligations are determined through our annual financial and strategic planning processes our 2010 funding plan anticipates repayment of principal on outstanding shortterm borrowings 1331 billion at december 31 2009 through commercial paper issuances cash on hand longterm debt issuances collections of financing receivables exceeding originations and deposit funding and alternative sources of funding 

   

interest on borrowings is primarily funded through interest earned on existing financing receivables during 2009 gecs earned interest income on financing receivables of 234 billion which more than offset interest expense of 179 billion purchase obligations and other general obligations are funded through customer sales revenues industrial or collection of principal on our existing portfolio of loans and leases financial services cash on hand and operating cash flow 

   

we maintain a strong focus on our liquidity since the fourth quarter of 2008 we have taken a number of actions to strengthen and maintain liquidity including 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

56 

  

cash and equivalents 

 

we have cash and equivalents of 723 billion at december 31 2009 which is available to meet company needs a substantial portion of this is freely available about 8 billion is in regulated entities and is subject to regulatory restrictions about 9 billion is held outside the us and is available to fund operations and other growth of nonus subsidiaries it is also available to fund company needs in the us on a shortterm basis without being subject to us tax we anticipate that we will continue to generate cash from operating activities in the future which will be available to help meet our liquidity needs we also generate substantial cash from the principal collections of loans and rentals from leased assets 

we have committed unused credit lines totaling 517 billion that had been extended to us by 59 financial institutions at december 31 2009 these lines include 368 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 144 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for one year from the date of expiration of the lending agreement 

funding plan 

 

in 2009 gecs issued 697 billion of longterm debt including 465 billion issued under the tlgp and 232 billion in nonguaranteed senior unsecured debt with maturities up to 30 years included in our 2009 issuances is 38 billion that represents the prefunding of our 2010 longterm debt funding plan in 2010 we have issued 51 billion through february 15 2010 toward our 2011 longterm funding plan 

under the tlgp the fdic guaranteed certain senior unsecured debt issued on or before october 31 2009 our tlgpguaranteed debt matures in 2010 6 billion 2011 18 billion and 2012 35 billion we anticipate funding of these and our other longterm debt maturities through a combination of new debt issuances collections exceeding originations alternative funding sources and use of existing cash 

we currently expect that the expiration of the tlgp will not have a significant effect on our liquidity if however significant disruption in the credit markets were to return or if the challenging market conditions continue our ability to issue unsecured longterm debt may be affected in the event we cannot sufficiently access our normal sources of funding as a result of the ongoing credit market turmoil we have a number of alternative means to enhance liquidity including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that our existing funds combined with our alternative means to enhance liquidity provide us with sufficient funds to meet our needs and financial obligations 

  

57 

  

we maintain securitization capability in most of the asset classes we have traditionally securitized however in 2008 and 2009 these capabilities have been and continue to be more limited than in 2007 we have continued to execute new securitizations throughout this period using bank administered commercial paper conduits and more recently have executed new securitizations in both the public term markets and in the private markets in 2009 we have completed issuances from these platforms in an aggregate amount of 140 billion 43 billion of these issuances were eligible for investors to use as collateral under talf total proceeds including sales to revolving facilities from our securitizations were 187 billion and 714 billion during the three months and yearended december 31 2009 respectively comparable amounts for 2008 were 178 billion and 768 billion respectively 

we have deposittaking capability at 18 banks outside of the us and two banks in the us – ge money bank a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposit cds distributed by brokers in maturity terms from three months to ten years bank deposits which are a large component of our alternative funding were 389 billion at december 31 2009 including cds of 177 billion total alternative funding increased from 55 billion to 57 billion during 2009 primarily resulting from an increase in bank deposits mainly from the acquisitions of bac and interbanca spa partially offset by a planned reduction in bank borrowings 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are originating we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that model effects of shifts in rates these are not forecasts 

 

 

 

debt instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

credit ratings 

 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting on march 12 2009 standard  poor’s sp downgraded ge and ge capital’s longterm rating by one notch from “aaa” to “aa” and at the same time revised the outlook from negative to stable under sp’s definitions an obligation rated “aaa” has the highest rating assigned by sp the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong an obligation rated “aa” differs from an obligation rated “aaa” only to a small degree in that the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong an sp rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a longterm credit rating over the intermediate term in determining a rating outlook consideration is given to any changes in the economic andor fundamental business conditions stable means that a rating is not likely to change in the next six months to two years 

  

58 

  

on march 23 2009 moody’s investors service moody’s downgraded ge and ge capital’s longterm rating by two notches from “aaa” to “aa2” with a stable outlook and removed us from review for possible downgrade under moody’s definitions obligations rated “aaa” are judged to be of the highest quality with minimal credit risk obligations rated “aa” are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk 

in 2009 the shortterm ratings of “a1p1” were affirmed by both rating agencies at the same time with respect to ge ge capital services and ge capital these shortterm ratings are in the highest rating categories available from sp and moodys under the sp definitions a shortterm obligation rated a1 indicates that the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment is extremely strong under the moodys definitions an issuer that is rated p1 has a superior ability to repay shortterm debt obligations 

we do not believe that the downgrades by sp and moody’s have had a material impact on our cost of funding or liquidity as the downgrades had been widely anticipated in the market and were already reflected in the spreads on our debt 

ge gecs and ge capital have distinct business characteristics that the major debt rating agencies evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively 

quantitative measures include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualitative measures include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal debt conditions are described below 

the following conditions relate to ge and gecs 

 

 

  

59 

  

 

 

 

 

the following conditions relate to consolidated entities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

 

as set forth in exhibit 99e hereto ge capital’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges declined to 0851 during 2009 due to lower pretax earnings at ge capital which were primarily driven by higher provisions for losses on financing receivables in connection with the challenging economic environment 

  

60 

  

income maintenance agreement 

 

on march 28 1991 ge entered into an agreement with ge capital to make payments to ge capital constituting additions to pretax income under the agreement to the extent necessary to cause the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of ge capital and consolidated affiliates determined on a consolidated basis to be not less than 1101 for the period as a single aggregation of each ge capital fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 1991 on october 29 2009 ge and ge capital amended this agreement which is filed as exhibit 10v hereto to extend the notice period for termination from three years to five years it was further amended to provide that any future amendments to the agreement that could adversely affect ge capital require the consent of the majority of the holders of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured debt securities issued or guaranteed by ge capital with an original stated maturity in excess of 270 days unless the amendment does not trigger a downgrade of ge capital’s longterm ratings 

ge made a 95 billion payment to gecs in the first quarter of 2009 of which 88 billion was further contributed to ge capital through capital contribution and share issuance to improve tangible capital and reduce leverage this payment constitutes an addition to pretax income under the agreement and therefore increased the ratio of earnings to fixed charges of ge capital for the fiscal year 2009 for purposes of the agreement to 1331 as a result no further payments under the agreement in 2010 are required related to 2009 should this ratio fall below 1101 for the fiscal year 2010 further payments would be required by ge to ge capital we currently expect to make a payment from ge to ge capital in 2011 of about 2 billion pursuant to this agreement 

any payment made under the income maintenance agreement will not affect the ratio of earnings to fixed charges as determined in accordance with current sec rules because it does not constitute an addition to pretax income under current us gaap 

tlgp 

 

on november 12 2008 the fdic approved ge capital’s application for designation as an eligible entity under the fdic’s tlgp qualifying debt issued by ge capital on or before october 31 2009 is guaranteed under the debt guarantee program of the tlgp and is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the fdic’s guarantee under the tlgp is effective until the earlier of the maturity of the debt or december 31 2012 at december 31 2009 ge capital had issued and outstanding 593 billion of senior unsecured debt that was guaranteed by the fdic under the tlgp we have incurred 23 billion of fees for our participation in the tlgp through december 31 2009 these fees are amortized into interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings ge capital and ge are parties to an eligible entity designation agreement and ge capital is subject to the terms of a master agreement each entered into with the fdic the terms of these agreements include among other things a requirement that ge and ge capital reimburse the fdic for any amounts that the fdic pays to holders of ge capital debt that is guaranteed by the fdic 

consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity 

 

ge shareowners’ equity increased by 126 billion in 2009 compared with a decrease of 109 billion in 2008 and an increase of 41 billion in 2007 

net earnings increased ge shareowners equity by 110 billion 174 billion and 222 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 68 billion 126 billion and 117 billion in 2009 2008 2007 respectively 

elements of other comprehensive income increased shareowners’ equity by 67 billion in 2009 compared with a decrease of 302 billion in 2008 and an increase of 49 billion in 2007 inclusive of changes in accounting principles the components of these changes are as follows 

  

61 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as discussed previously in the liquidity and borrowings section of this item we took a number of actions in 2008 and 2009 to strengthen our liquidity and our credit rating such actions also had an effect on shareowners’ equity which included a 15 billion addition to equity through common and preferred stock offerings in the fourth quarter of 2008 and reduction in the dividend on ge stock which had a 4 billion positive effect on equity in 2009 

overview of our cash flow from 2007 through 2009 

 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 723 billion at december 31 2009 an increase of 241 billion from december 31 2008 cash and equivalents totaled 482 billion at december 31 2008 an increase of 325 billion from december 31 2007 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

ge cash flow 

 

ge cash and equivalents were 87 billion at december 31 2009 compared with 121 billion at december 31 2008 ge cfoa totaled 166 billion in 2009 compared with 191 billion and 233 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively with respect to ge cfoa we believe that it is useful to supplement our ge statement of cash flows and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

  

62 

  

 

 

 

the most significant source of cash in ge cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections decreased by 114 billion in 2009 and increased by 127 billion in 2008 these changes are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section are the best way of understanding their customerrelated cfoa 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services ge operating cash payments decreased in 2009 by 113 billion and increased by 120 billion in 2008 these changes are consistent with the changes in ge total costs and expenses 

ge cfoa decreased 25 billion compared with 2008 primarily reflecting the lack of a currentyear dividend from gecs 24 billion in 2008 ge cfoa decreased 42 billion compared with 2007 primarily reflecting a decrease in the dividend from gecs of 49 billion 

dividends from gecs represented the distribution of a portion of gecs retained earnings and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses the amounts included in ge cfoa are the total dividends including normal dividends as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from gecs business sales beginning in the first quarter of 2009 gecs fully suspended its normal dividend to ge 

gecs cash flow 

 

gecs cash and equivalents were 644 billion at december 31 2009 compared with 375 billion at december 31 2008 gecs cash from operating activities totaled 76 billion in 2009 compared with cash from operating activities of 312 billion in 2008 this decrease was primarily due to an overall decline in net earnings a currentyear reduction in cash collateral held from counterparties on derivative contracts of 69 billion and declines in taxes payable 27 billion in addition 2008 gecs cash from operating activities benefited from an increase in cash collateral posted by counterparties 

   

consistent with our plan to reduce gecs asset levels cash from investing activities was 457 billion in 2009 440 billion resulted from a reduction in financing receivables primarily from collections exceeding originations and 91 billion resulted from proceeds from business dispositions including the consumer businesses in austria and finland the credit card and auto businesses in the uk the credit card business in ireland a portion of our australian residential mortgage business and the thailand business these sources were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions of 57 billion primarily for the acquisition of interbanca spa 

 

 

gecs cash used for financing activities in 2009 reflected our continued reduction in ending net investment cash used for financing activities of 264 billion related primarily to a 269 billion reduction in borrowings maturities 90 days or less primarily commercial paper reductions in longterm borrowings partially offset by the prefunding of our 2010 longterm debt maturities and a 40 billion decrease in bank deposits partially offset by a capital contribution from ge to gecs of 95 billion 

 

  

63 

  

 

gecs pays dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales there were no dividends paid to ge in 2009 compared with 24 billion and 73 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively there were no special dividends paid to ge in 2009 and 2008 compared with 24 billion in 2007 

intercompany eliminations 

 

effects of transactions between related companies are eliminated and consist primarily of gecs dividends to ge or capital contributions from ge to gecs ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for further information related to intercompany eliminations 

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2009 follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variable interest entities and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business to improve shareowner returns and as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions our securitization activities are conducted using variable interest entities vies principally qspes

certain of our vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary and qspes are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement at december 31 2009 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 170 billion and 152 billion respectively a decrease of 99 billion and 62 billion from 2008 respectively in the first quarter of 2009 we deconsolidated ptl and removed 70 billion of assets and 08 billion of liabilities from our balance sheet the deconsolidation was a result of our reducing our investment in ptl by selling a 1 limited partnership interest to penske truck leasing corporation the general partner of ptl whose majority shareowner is a member of ge’s board of directors coupled with our resulting minority position on the ptl advisory committee and related changes in our contractual rights we recognized a pretax gain on the sale of 03 billion including a gain on the remeasurement of our retained investment of 02 billion 

at december 31 2009 variable interests in unconsolidated vies other than qspes were 97 billion an increase of 57 billion from 2008 primarily related to the deconsolidation of ptl in addition to our existing investments we have contractual obligations to fund additional investments in the unconsolidated vies of 14 billion an increase of 02 billion from 2008 together these represent our maximum exposure to loss if the assets of the unconsolidated vies were to have no value 

qspes that we use for securitization are funded with assetbacked commercial paper and term debt the assets we securitize include receivables secured by equipment commercial real estate credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business at december 31 2009 securitization entities held 469 billion in transferred financial assets a decrease of 57 billion from yearend 2008 assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our onbook assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

   

at december 31 2009 our statement of financial position included 118 billion in retained interests related to the transferred financial assets discussed above these retained interests are held by qspes and vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary and take two forms 1 sellers’ interests which are classified as financing receivables and 2 subordinated interests designed to provide credit enhancement to senior interests which are classified as investment securities the carrying value of our retained interests classified as financing receivables was 30 billion at december 31 2009 a decrease of 12 billion from 2008 the carrying value of our retained interests classified as investment securities was 88 billion at december 31 2009 an increase of 25 billion from 2008 certain of these retained interests are accounted for with changes in fair value recorded in earnings during 2009 we recognized increases in fair values on these retained interests of 03 billion compared with declines in fair value on these retained interests of 01 billion in 2008 for those retained interests classified as investment securities we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of 01 billion in 2009 compared with 03 billion in 2008 our recourse liability in these arrangements was an inconsequential amount in both 2009 and 2008 

   

we are party to various credit enhancement positions with securitization entities including liquidity and credit support agreements and guarantee and reimbursement contracts and have provided our best estimate of the fair value of estimated losses on such positions the estimate of fair value is based on prevailing market conditions at december 31 2009 should market conditions deteriorate actual losses could be higher our exposure to loss under such agreements was limited to 21 billion at december 31 2009 

   

we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vie or qspe we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred financing receivables to any vie or qspe in either 2009 or 2008

in 2009 the fasb issued asu 200916 and asu 200917 amendments to asc 860 transfers and servicing  and asc 810 consolidation  respectively which are effective for us on january 1 2010 asu 200916 will eliminate the qspe concept and asu 200917 will require that all such entities be evaluated for consolidation as vies which will result in our consolidating substantially all of our former qspes upon adoption we will record assets and liabilities of these entities at carrying amounts consistent as if they had always been consolidated which will require the reversal of a portion of previously recognized securitization gains as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings see the new accounting standards section of this item for further discussion 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio this estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values and the present and expected future levels of interest rates our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and we evaluate relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments increased earnings by 02 billion in 2009 decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2008 and increased earnings by 04 billion in 2007 we provide for probable losses when they become evident

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria effective april 1 2009 the fasb amended asc 320 and modified the requirements for recognizing and measuring otherthantemporary impairment for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 21 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use quoted market prices when available our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate and independent appraisals as appropriate 

our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft is a significant concentration of assets in capital finance and is particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on managements best estimate in determining its best estimate management evaluates average current market values obtained from third parties of similar type and age aircraft which are adjusted for the attributes of the specific aircraft under lease 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 01 billion in both 2009 and 2008 provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were 01 billion in 2009 and insignificant in 2008 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 7 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

real estate we review the estimated value of our commercial real estate investments semiannually the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values as of our most recent estimate performed in 2009 the carrying value of our real estate investments exceeded their estimated value by about 7 billion the estimated value of the portfolio reflects the continued deteriorating real estate values and market fundamentals including reduced market occupancy rates and market rents as well as the effects of limited real estate market liquidity given the current and expected challenging market conditions there continues to be risk and uncertainty surrounding commercial real estate values and our unrealized loss on real estate equity properties may continue to increase declines in the estimated value of real estate below carrying amount result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below the carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon current market data including current capitalization rates during 2009 capital finance real estate recognized pretax impairments of 08 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 03 billion in 2008 continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets results in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management section of this item and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results for purposes of the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates by applying the capital asset pricing model ie to estimate the cost of equity financing and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts valuations using the market approach reflect prices and other relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 

   

compared to the market approach the income approach more closely aligns the reporting unit valuation to a company’s or business’ specific business model geographic markets and product offerings as it is based on specific projections of the business required rates of return along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows are reflected in the selection of the discount rate equally important under this approach reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future circumstances that may not be reflected in an observable market price a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples it can be somewhat more limited in its application because the population of potential comparables or pure plays is often limited to publiclytraded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or nonpublic subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg synergies between the parties terms and conditions of the transaction etc may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business it can also be difficult under the current market conditions to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar financial services businesses we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of data at the time of performing the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately

given the significant decline in our stock price in the first quarter of 2009 and market conditions in the financial services industry at that time we conducted an additional impairment analysis of the capital finance reporting units during the first quarter of 2009 using data as of january 1 2009 as a result of these tests no goodwill impairment was recognized 

   

we performed our annual impairment test for goodwill at all of our reporting units in the third quarter using data as of july 1 2009 in performing the valuations we used cash flows which reflected management’s forecasts and discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the current market based on the results of our testing the fair values at each of the ge industrial reporting units and the cll consumer energy financial services and gecas reporting units exceeded their book values therefore the second step of the impairment test in which fair value of each of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is measured was not required to be performed and no goodwill impairment was recognized due to the volatility and uncertainties in the current commercial real estate environment we used a range of valuations to determine the fair value for our real estate reporting unit while the real estate reporting unit’s book value was within the range of its fair value we further substantiated our real estate goodwill balance by performing the second step analysis described above as a result of our tests for real estate no goodwill impairment was recognized our real estate reporting unit had a goodwill balance of 12 billion at december 31 2009 

   

estimating the fair value of reporting units involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results if current conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits 

further information is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – goodwill and other intangible assets section of this item and in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense 

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were 578 611 and 634 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

  

69 

  

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth yields and spreads across a number of potential scenarios assets in our principal pension plans earned 100 in 2009 and had average annual earnings of 31 85 and 100 per year in the 10 15 and 25year periods ended december 31 2009 respectively based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and expected asset allocations we have assumed an 85 longterm expected return on those assets 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans follows

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company at december 31 2009 84 billion of earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the united states most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 36 billion and 31 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively including 12 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively reported in assets of discontinued operations primarily related to our loss on the sale of ge money japan such yearend 2009 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation 

at december 31 2009 derivative assets and liabilities were 80 billion and 37 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 9 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities and derivatives assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances include loans and longlived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost and equity method investments and longlived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and the remeasurement of retained investments in formerly consolidated subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in deconsolidation of a subsidiary if we sell a controlling interest and retain a noncontrolling stake in the entity assets that are written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs 

a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued further information on fair value measurements is provided in notes 1 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded provision contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators

other information 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in 2009 the fasb issued asu 200916 and asu 200917 which amended asc 860 transfers and servicing  and asc 810 consolidation  respectively and are effective for us on january 1 2010 asu 200916 will eliminate the qspe concept and asu 200917 will require that all such entities be evaluated for consolidation as vies which will result in our consolidating substantially all of our former qspes 

among other changes the amendments to asc 810 replace the existing quantitative approach for identifying the party that should consolidate a vie which was based on exposure to a majority of the risks and rewards with a qualitative approach based on determination of which party has the power to direct the most economically significant activities of the entity the revised guidance will sometimes change the composition of entities that meet the definition of a vie and the determination about which party should consolidate a vie as well as requiring the latter to be evaluated continuously 

we have evaluated all entities that fall within the scope of the amended asc 810 to determine whether we will be required to consolidate or deconsolidate these entities on january 1 2010 in addition to the former qspes described above we will consolidate assets of vies related to direct investments in entities that hold loans and fixed income securities a media joint venture and a small number of companies to which we have extended loans in the ordinary course of business and have subsequently been subject to a troubled debt restructuring 

upon adoption of the amendments on january 1 2010 we will consolidate the assets and liabilities of these entities at the amount they would have been reported in our financial statements had we always consolidated them we will also deconsolidate certain entities where we do not meet the definition of the primary beneficiary under the revised guidance the effect of which will be insignificant the incremental effect of consolidation on total assets and liabilities net of our investment in these entities will be an increase of approximately 32 billion and 34 billion respectively there also will be a net reduction of equity of approximately 2 billion principally related to the reversal of previously recognized securitization gains as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings which will be earned back over the life of the assets 

the assets of qspes that we will be required to consolidate will be approximately 29 billion net of our existing retained interests of approximately 9 billion and liabilities will be 31 billion at january 1 2010 significant assets of the qspes will include net financing receivables and trade receivables of approximately 39 billion and investment securities of approximately 1 billion significant liabilities will include shortterm and longterm borrowings of 19 billion each the assets and liabilities of other vies we will consolidate will be approximately 2 billion each 

the amended guidance on asc 860 also modifies existing derecognition criteria in a manner that will significantly narrow the types of transactions that will qualify as sales the revised criteria will apply prospectively to transfers of financial assets occurring after december 31 2009 

on september 23 2009 the fasb issued amendments to existing standards for revenue arrangements with multiple components the amendments generally require the allocation of consideration to separate components based on the relative selling price of each component in a revenue arrangement the amendments also require certain softwareenabled products to be accounted for under the general accounting standards for multiple component arrangements as opposed to accounting standards specifically applicable to software arrangements the amendments are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january 1 2011 the financial statement impact of adopting these amendments is expected to be insignificant to our financial statements

supplemental information 

 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this annual report to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

 

we have provided the increase in 2009 segment profit excluding the earnings of our financial services segment capital finance and our media business nbc universal we believe that this is a useful comparison because it provides investors with information on the results of our industrial businesses without the nbc universal business which is classified as a business held for sale at december 31 2009 we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides management and investors with additional information for comparison to other industrial businesses 

 

 

  

73 

  

we refer to cash generated by our industrial businesses as industrial cfoa which we define as ge’s cash from operating activities less the amount of dividends received by ge from gecs this includes the effects of intercompany transactions including ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased between ge and gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs we believe that investors may find it useful to compare ge’s operating cash flows without the effect of gecs dividends since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the financial services gecs cash flows we believe that our measure of industrial cfoa provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other nonfinancial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported gaap cfoa measure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings we exclude the cumulative effect of earnings losses of discontinued operations from the denominator in our rotc calculation 1 for each of the periods for which related discontinued operations were presented and 2 for our average net investment in discontinued operations since july 1 2005 had we disposed of these operations before july 1 2005 we would have applied the proceeds to reduce parentsupported debt at ge capital however since parentsupported debt at ge capital was retired by june 30 2005 we have assumed that we would have distributed the proceeds after that time to shareowners through share repurchases thus reducing average ge shareowners’ equity our calculation of average ge shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average ge shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary 

  

74 

  

 

we have provided the ge capital ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents to reduce debt and with longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity we believe that this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace certain longterm debt with equity in the first quarter of 2009 ge made a 95 billion payment to gecs of which 88 billion was further contributed to ge capital through capital contribution and share issuance despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses 

 

 

we use eni to measure the size of our financial services business we believe that this measure is a better indicator of the capital debt or equity required to fund a business as it adjusts for noninterest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay we also believe that by excluding the impact of gecs discontinued operations gecs headquarters items and the effects of currency exchange movements during the year we provide a more meaningful measure for our capital finance segment 

 

 

  

75 

  

 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecs net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecs tax rates shown in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses 

delinquency rates on certain financing receivables 

 

delinquency rates on managed equipment financing loans and leases and managed consumer financing receivables follow 

 

 

 

 

delinquency rates on onbook and offbook equipment financing loans and leases increased from december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 to december 31 2009 as a result of continuing weakness in the global economic and credit environment in addition delinquency rates on onbook equipment financing loans and leases increased nine basis points from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 as a result of the inclusion of the citicapital acquisition

the increase in onbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables in the us from december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 to december 31 2009 primarily reflects the continued rise in delinquencies across the us credit card receivables platforms the increase in onbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables outside of the us from december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 to december 31 2009 reflects the effects of the declining uk housing market the increase in offbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables in the us from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 primarily reflects the rise in delinquencies across the us credit card receivables platform the decrease in offbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables in the us from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 reflected the replacement of certain lowercredit quality receivables from a securitization trust in 2009 

we believe that delinquency rates on managed financing receivables provide a useful perspective of our portfolio quality and are key indicators of financial performance we use this nongaap financial measure because it provides information that enables management and investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of certain financing receivables and facilitates a comparison with the performance of our competitors the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both onbook and offbook portfolios as the customer’s credit performance will affect both loans retained on the statement of financial position and securitized loans we believe that managed basis information is useful to management and investors enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the statement of financial position and our retained interests in securitized loans

the unprecedented conditions in the financial and credit markets may affect the availability and cost of ge capital’s funding 

 

the financial and credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption putting downward pressure on financial and other asset prices generally and on the credit availability for certain issuers the us government and the federal reserve bank recently created a number of programs to help stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity many nonus governments have also created or announced similar measures for institutions in their respective countries these programs have improved conditions in the credit and financial markets but there can be no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will continue to have beneficial effects on the markets overall or will resolve the credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs 

 

a large portion of ge capital’s borrowings have been issued in the commercial paper and term debt markets ge capital has continued to issue commercial paper and as planned has reduced its outstanding commercial paper balance to 67 billion at the end of 2008 ge capital has also issued term debt mainly debt guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp and to a lesser extent on a nonguaranteed basis although the commercial paper and term debt markets have remained available to ge capital to fund its operations and debt maturities there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to be available or if available that the cost of such funding will not substantially increase if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen or if we cannot further reduce ge capital’s asset levels as planned in 2009 we would seek to repay commercial paper and term debt as it becomes due or to meet our other liquidity needs by using the federal reserve’s commercial paper funding facility cpff and the tlgp applying the net proceeds of our october 2008 equity offering and the investment by berkshire hathaway inc drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks andor seeking other sources of funding there can be no assurance however that the tlgp and the cpff will be extended beyond their scheduled expiration or that under such extreme market conditions contractually committed lending agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient 

 

our 2009 funding plan anticipates approximately 45 billion of senior unsecured longterm debt issuance in january 2009 we completed issuances of 110 billion of funding under the tlgp we also issued 51 billion in nonguaranteed senior unsecured debt with a maturity of 30 years under the nonguarantee option of the tlgp these issuances along with the 134 billion of prefunding done in december 2008 bring our aggregate issuances to 295 billion or 66 of our anticipated 2009 funding plan additionally we anticipate that we will be 90 complete with our 2009 funding plan by june 30 2009 

 

difficult conditions in the financial services markets have materially and adversely affected the business and results of operations of ge capital and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 

 

dramatic declines in the housing market with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment have resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions including governmentsponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks these writedowns initially of mortgagebacked securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital to merge with other institutions and in some cases to fail many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies lack of consumer confidence increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally if these conditions continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover fully the value of certain assets such as goodwill and intangibles in addition although we   have established allowances for losses in ge capital’s portfolio of financing receivables that we believe are adequate significant and unexpected further deterioration in the economy and in default and recovery rates could require us to increase these allowances and writeoffs which depending on the amount of the increase could have a material adverse effect on our   business  financial position and results of operations

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect ge capital 

 

ge capital has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose ge capital to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition ge capital’s credit risk may be increased when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon sale or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it ge capital also has exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments held in its investment portfolios ge capital has policies relating to initial credit rating requirements and to exposure limits to counterparties as described in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which mitigate credit and liquidity risk there can be no assurance however that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of financial assets would not materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

 

the real estate markets in which ge capital participates are highly uncertain 

 

ge capital participates in the commercial real estate market in two ways it provides financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties and it also acquires an equity position in various types of properties the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the specific geographic market in which the properties are located and the perceived value of that market at the time of sale such activity may vary significantly from one year to the next rising unemployment a slowdown in general business activity and recent disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect the value of real estate assets ge capital holds under current market and credit conditions there can be no assurance as to the level of sales ge capital will complete or the net sales proceeds it will realize also there can be no assurance that occupancy rates and market rentals will continue at their current levels given the current economic environment during the period in which ge capital continues to hold its equity investments in these properties which may result in an impairment to the carrying value of those investments 

 

ge capital is also a residential mortgage lender in certain geographic markets particularly in the united kingdom that have been and may continue to be adversely affected by declines in residential real estate values and home sale volumes job losses consumer bankruptcies and other factors that may negatively impact the credit performance of our mortgage loans our allowance for loan losses on these mortgage loans is based on our analysis of current and historical delinquency and loan performance as well as other management assumptions that may be inaccurate predictions of credit performance in this environment there can be no assurance that in this environment credit performance will not be materially worse than anticipated and as a result materially and adversely affect ge capital’s business financial position and results of operations 

 

failure to maintain our “triplea” credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in december 2008 standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed our and ge capital’s “aaa” longterm and “a1” shortterm corporate credit ratings but revised its ratings outlook from stable to negative based partly on the concerns regarding ge capital’s future performance and funding in light of capital market turmoil on january 24 2009 moody’s investment services placed the longterm ratings of ge and ge capital on review for possible downgrade the firm’s “prime1” shortterm ratings were affirmed moody’s said the review for downgrade is based primarily upon heightened uncertainty regarding ge capital’s asset quality and earnings performance in future periods in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the difficult financial markets there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our 2009 operational and funding plan for ge capital or in the event of further deterioration in the financial markets that completion of our plan and any other steps we might take in response will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our “triplea” ratings failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets various debt instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade but none are triggered if our ratings are reduced to aaaa3 or a1p1 or higher

current conditions in the global economy and the major industries we serve also may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of our nonfinancial businesses 

 

the business and operating results of our technology infrastructure energy infrastructure consumer and industrial and media businesses have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions and in particular conditions in the air and rail transportation energy generation healthcare network television and other major industries we serve as a result of slowing global economic growth the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence increased unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures fluctuating commodity prices bankruptcies and other challenges currently affecting the global economy our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing as a result existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services including large infrastructure projects and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion contract cancellations could affect our ability to fully recover our contract costs and estimated earnings further our vendors may be experiencing similar conditions which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us although the new administration in the united states is expected to enact various economic stimulus programs there can be no assurance as to the timing and effectiveness of these programs if the global economic slowdown continues for a significant period or there is significant further deterioration in the global economy our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

 

our global growth is subject to economic and political risks 

 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world in 2008 approximately 53 of our revenues were attributable to activities outside the united states our operations are subject to the effects of global competition they are also affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful and our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments 

 

the success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions 

 

with respect to acquisitions and mergers we may not be able to identify suitable candidates at terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner as was the case with our consumer  industrial business in 2008 which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives alternatively we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated these difficulties have been exacerbated in the current financial and credit environment because some potential sellers may hold onto assets pending a rebound in prices and buyers may have difficulty obtaining the necessary financing in addition there is a risk that we may sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations in which case our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value 

 

there are risks inherent in owning our common stock 

 

the market price and volume of our common stock have been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these may arise from general stock market conditions the impact of the risk factors described above on our financial condition and results of operations a change in sentiment in the market regarding us or our business prospects or from other factors changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

  

15 

  

we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 

 

our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of us federal state and foreign laws regulations and policies there can be no assurance that in response to current economic conditions laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investment by making existing practices more restricted subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright in particular we expect us and foreign governments to undertake a substantial review and revision of the regulation and supervision of bank and nonbank financial institutions and tax laws and regulation which may have a significant effect on ge capital’s structure operations and performance we are also subject to regulatory risks from laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing local liquidity regulations that may increase the risk of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with foreign banks and other foreign financial institutions in global markets this provision currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2009 has been scheduled to expire and has been extended by congress on five previous occasions including in october of 2008 but there can be no assurance that it will continue to be extended in the event this provision is not extended after 2009 the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets if this provision is not extended we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly after 2010 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks 

 

we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks we and our subsidiaries our businesses and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages these include investigations by the department of justice antitrust division and the us securities and exchange commission sec of the marketing and sales of guaranteed investment contracts and other financial instruments to municipalities by certain subsidiaries of ge capital and an investigation by the sec of possible violations of the securities laws with respect to certain accounting issues as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report additionally we and our subsidiaries are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws these include the dredging of polychlorinated biphenyls from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state as described in item 1 “business” of this form 10k report we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings described in item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k report while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty will arise from time to time 

 

significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets discount rates and other factors could affect our results of operations equity and pension contributions in future periods 

 

our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions we used to estimate pension income or expense for 2009 are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plans assets in addition we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to accumulated gains losses – net benefit plans at the end of 2008 the projected benefit obligation of our us principal pension plans was 451 billion and assets were 407 billion for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies see critical accounting estimates – pension assumptions in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the employee retirement income security act erisa

 item 3 legal proceedings  

 

as previously reported in january 2005 the staff of the us securities and exchange commission sec informed us that it had commenced an investigation and requested certain documents and information with respect to the use of hedge accounting for derivatives by us and general electric capital corporation in august 2005 the sec staff advised us that the sec had issued a formal order of investigation in the matter the sec investigation is continuing and the sec staff has taken testimony in this matter and has requested information about other ge accounting policies and practices including items related to revenue recognition and our cash flow presentations 

 

we continue to cooperate with the ongoing sec investigation and to discuss the investigation and issues arising in that investigation and our internal review of certain accounting matters with the sec staff with a goal of completing our review and resolving these matters as part of this process we have had discussions with the sec staff concerning resolution of these matters in september 2008 the sec staff issued a “wells notice” advising us that it is considering recommending to the sec that it bring a civil injunctive action against ge for possible violations of the securities laws we have been informed that the issues the staff may recommend that the sec pursue relate to the application of sfas 133 in 2002 and 2003 with respect to accounting for derivatives formerly used to hedge the risk of interest rate changes related to commercial paper and for certain derivatives in which a fee was a part of the consideration for the derivative a change in 2002 in our accounting for profits on certain aftermarket spare parts primarily in our aviation business certain 2003 and earlier transactions involving financial intermediaries in our rail business and historical accounting for revenue recognition on product sales subject to intransit risk of damage principally in our healthcare infrastructure and industrial segments we have already disclosed these items in previously filed sec reports including their effects on particular periods and corrected our financial statements with respect to each of them the cumulative effect of these items on our financial statements was a reduction in net earnings by approximately 300 million in the period from 2001 through december 31 2007 we have implemented a number of remedial actions and internal control enhancements also as described in our sec reports all of these items were reviewed or discussed with kpmg which audited our financial statements throughout the periods in question 

 

we disagree with the sec staff regarding this recommendation and have been in discussions with the staff including discussion of potential resolution of the matter we intend to continue these discussions and understand that we will have the opportunity to address any disagreements with the sec staff with respect to its recommendation through the wells process with the full commission if the commission were to authorize an action against ge it could seek an injunction against future violations of provisions of the federal securities laws including potentially sections 13a 13b and 10b of the exchange act and section 17a of the securities act the imposition of penalties and other relief within the commission’s authority if we were to resolve the matter through a settlement we would neither admit nor deny the proposed allegations but could agree to the resolution and entry of an injunction there can be no assurance that we and the sec would reach agreement on a proposed settlement as a result of our discussions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 

operations 

 

our consolidated financial statements combine the industrial manufacturing services and media businesses of general electric company ge with the financial services businesses of general electric capital services inc gecs or financial services 

 

in the accompanying analysis of financial information we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under the us securities and exchange commission sec rules for such measures we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in the supplemental information section 

 

we present management’s discussion of operations in five parts overview of our earnings from 2006 through 2008 global risk management segment operations geographic operations and environmental matters unless otherwise indicated we refer to captions such as revenues and earnings from continuing operations simply as “revenues” and “earnings” throughout this management’s discussion and analysis similarly discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

 

overview of our earnings from 2006 through 2008 

 

our results for the last three years reflect our strategy to strengthen our position as a worldwide growth company operating in diverse industries in which we maintain strong marketleader positions during 2008 we encountered unprecedented conditions in the world economy and financial markets that affected all of our businesses over the threeyear period our consolidated revenues grew 20 on organic growth that averaged 6 per year yet earnings declined 6 our financial services businesses were most significantly affected as earnings fell 24 on a 16 increase in revenues over this threeyear period 

 

the information that follows will show how our global diversification and risk management strategies have helped us to grow revenues and industrial earnings to record levels and to outperform our peers in financial services businesses we also believe that the disposition of our less strategic businesses our restructuring actions and our investment in businesses with strong growth potential have positioned us well for the future 

 

energy infrastructure 19 and 18 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively was well positioned to grow significantly over the last several years as the worldwide demand for energy and for alternative sources of power such as wind and thermal rose to new levels this resulted in a 53 increase in revenues and a 73 increase in segment profit over the threeyear period we continued to invest in marketleading technology and services at energy oil  gas and water 

 

technology infrastructure 25 and 29 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively grew revenues 23 and earnings 12 over the threeyear period as we continued to invest in marketleading technologies and services at aviation and transportation and strategic acquisitions at healthcare aviation continued to grow revenues and earnings to record levels as one of the world’s leading providers of aircraft engines and services the aviation orders backlog also continued to grow positioning us well for the future product services and sales of our evolution series locomotives contributed to transportation’s growth over the last three years and we have invested heavily in expanding our global platform healthcare realized benefits from the acquisition of idx systems corporation in 2006 expanding the breadth of our product and service offerings to the healthcare industry healthcare was adversely affected by the effects of the deficit reduction act on us equipment sales in addition lower sales of surgical imaging equipment resulted from a regulatory suspension on shipments at one of our facilities we began shipping some of these products in the first half of 2008 enterprise solutions offers protection and productivity solutions such as safe facilities plant automation power control and sensing applications 

 

nbc universal 10 and 11 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively is a diversified media and entertainment company that has grown through business and geographic diversity while the television business continues to be challenged by the effects of a difficult economy our cable business continues to grow and become more profitable our film business also continues to perform well with consistent contributions to earnings 

 

  

22 

  

capital finance 37 and 39 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively is a strong focused business with leading positions in several midmarket corporate and consumer financing segments our performance has been strong over the longterm with solid risk management and underwriting through various credit cycles more recently we have been affected by economic changes specifically the disruptions in capital markets challenging credit market environment and rising unemployment our earnings in 2008 and 2007 were 86 billion and 122 billion respectively we expect the current challenging credit and economic environment to continue to affect our earnings in 2009 throughout 2008 we tightened underwriting standards shifted teams from origination to collection and maintained a proactive risk management focus our focus is to manage through the current challenging credit environment and reposition ge capital as a diversely funded and smaller finance company 

 

consumer  industrial 7 and 3 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions reflective of the downturn in the us housing market consumer  industrial revenues have declined over the threeyear period in response to these tough economic conditions in 2007 consumer  industrial began a restructuring plan focused on reducing manufacturing capacity and transferring work to lowercost countries despite these cost reduction efforts segment profit declined on higher material and other costs 

 

overall acquisitions contributed 74 billion 77 billion and 39 billion to consolidated revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our consolidated earnings included approximately 08 billion in 2008 and 05 billion in both 2007 and 2006 from acquired businesses we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible only revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth following quarter are attributed to such businesses dispositions also affected our ongoing results through higher revenues of 01 billion in 2008 and lower revenues of 36 billion and 13 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively this resulted in higher earnings of 04 billion in both 2008 and 2007 and 01 billion in 2006 

 

significant matters relating to our statement of earnings are explained below 

 

discontinued operations in september 2007 we committed to a plan to sell our japanese personal loan business lake upon determining that despite restructuring japanese regulatory limits for interest charges on unsecured personal loans did not permit us to earn an acceptable return during 2008 we completed the sale of ge money japan which included lake along with our japanese mortgage and card businesses excluding our minority ownership in ge nissen credit co ltd in december 2007 we completed the exit of wmc as a result of continued pressures in the us subprime mortgage industry both of these businesses were previously reported in the capital finance segment 

 

in august 2007 we completed the sale of our plastics business we sold this business because of its cyclicality rising costs of natural gas and raw materials and the decision to redeploy capital resources into highergrowth businesses during 2006 we sold our advanced materials business 

 

in 2006 we substantially completed our planned exit of the insurance businesses through the sale of the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses and the european life and health operations of ge insurance solutions corporation ge insurance solutions and the sale of ge life our ukbased life insurance operation to swiss reinsurance company swiss re and the sale through a secondary public offering of our remaining 18 investment in genworth financial inc genworth our formerly whollyowned subsidiary that conducted most of our consumer insurance business including life and mortgage insurance operations 

 

we reported the businesses described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented for further information about discontinued operations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

we declared 126 billion in dividends in 2008 common pershare dividends of 124 were up 8 from 2007 following a 12 increase from the preceding year on february 6 2009 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 031 per share of common stock which is payable april 27 2009 to shareowners of record at close of business on february 23 2009 this payment will complete the dividend for the first half of 2009 the board will continue to evaluate the company’s dividend level for the second half of 2009 in light of the growing uncertainty in the economy including us government actions rising unemployment and the recent announcements by the rating agencies in 2008 we declared 01 billion in preferred stock dividends 

 

  

23 

  

except as otherwise noted the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of ge with gecs included on a oneline basis and gecs see the segment operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within ge and gecs 

 

ge sales of product services were 355 billion in 2008 a 10 increase from 2007 increases in product services in 2008 and 2007 were led by growth at energy infrastructure and technology infrastructure operating profit from product services was 93 billion in 2008 up 3 from 2007 

 

postretirement benefit plans costs were 22 billion 26 billion and 23 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the cost decreased in 2008 primarily because of the effects of prior years’ investment gains higher discount rates and benefits from new healthcare supplier contracts partially offset by additional costs of plan benefits resulting from union negotiations and a pensioner increase in 2007 the cost increased in 2007 primarily because of plan benefit changes resulting from new us labor agreements and increases in retiree medical and drug costs partially offset by increases in discount rates for the year and effects of recent investment gains the cost increased in 2006 primarily because of the effects of prioryears’ investment losses and lower discount rates 

 

considering the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets will be 85 for cost recognition in 2009 the same level as we assumed in 2008 2007 and 2006 gaap provides recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees 

 

we expect the costs of our postretirement benefits in 2009 to be about the same as the 2008 costs the effects of decreasing discount rates principal pension plans’ discount rate decreasing from 634 to 611 will be largely offset by prioryears’ investment gains and benefits from new healthcare supplier contracts assuming our 2009 actual experience is consistent with our current benefit assumptions eg expected return on assets discount rates and healthcare trend rates we expect that costs of our postretirement benefits will increase by approximately 10 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to amortization of our unamortized losses relating to our principal pension plans 

 

our principal pension plans were underfunded by 44 billion at the end of 2008 as compared to overfunded by 168 billion at december 31 2007 at december 31 2008 the ge pension plan was underfunded by 09 billion and the ge supplementary pension plan which is an unfunded plan had a projected benefit obligation of 35 billion the reduction in surplus from yearend 2007 was primarily attributable to asset investment performance resulting from the deteriorating market conditions and economic environment in 2008 our principal pension plans’ assets decreased from 597 billion at the end of 2007 to 407 billion at december 31 2008 a 282 decline in investment values during the year assets of the ge pension plan are held in trust solely for the benefit of plan participants and are not available for general company operations although the reduction in pension plan assets in 2008 will impact future pension plan costs the company’s requirement to make future cash contributions to the trust will depend on future market and economic conditions 

 

on an employee retirement income security act erisa basis the ge pension plan remains fully funded at january 1 2009 we will not make any contributions to the ge pension plan in 2009 assuming our 2009 actual experience is consistent with our current benefit assumptions eg expected return on assets and interest rates we will not be required to make contributions to the ge pension plan in 2010 

 

at december 31 2008 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 24 billion less than the respective projected benefit obligations the comparable amount at december 31 2007 was 16 billion we expect to contribute 07 billion to our other pension plans in 2009 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion and 07 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively our principal retiree health and life plans obligations exceeded the fair value of related assets by 108 billion and 112 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we fund our retiree health benefits on a payasyougo basis we expect to contribute 07 billion to these plans in 2009 compared with actual contributions of 06 billion in 2008 and 2007 

 

the funded status of our postretirement benefits plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions 

 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses these costs were 129 142 and 143 of total ge sales in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

  

24 

  

interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 262 billion 238 billion and 189 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are in financial services where interest expense was 251 billion 227 billion and 178 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively average borrowings increased over the threeyear period interest rates increased from 2006 to 2007 attributable to rising credit spreads interest rates have decreased from 2007 to 2008 in line with general market conditions gecs average borrowings were 5212 billion 4564 billion and 3890 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively gecs average composite effective interest rate was 48 in 2008 50 in 2007 and 46 in 2006 in 2008 gecs average assets of 6672 billion were 13 higher than in 2007 which in turn were 17 higher than in 2006 we anticipate that our composite rates will continue to decline through 2009 as a result of decreased benchmark rates globally however these decreases in benchmark rates will be partially offset by higher credit spreads and fees associated with government guarantees and higher cash balances resulting from prefunding of debt maturities and the need to maintain greater liquidity in the current environment see the liquidity and borrowings section for a discussion of liquidity borrowings and interest rate risk management 

 

income taxes are a significant cost as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

 

income taxes on consolidated earnings from continuing operations were 55 in 2008 compared with 156 in 2007 and 169 in 2006 our consolidated income tax rate decreased from 2007 to 2008 primarily because of a reduction during 2008 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations on the tax rate in addition earnings from lowertaxed global operations increased from 2007 to 2008 the increase in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations includes a benefit from the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest outside the us prioryear earnings because the use of foreign tax credits no longer required the repatriation of those prioryear earnings 

 

our consolidated income tax rate decreased from 2006 to 2007 as the tax benefit on the disposition of our investment in ses and an increase in favorable settlements with tax authorities more than offset a decrease in the benefit from lowertaxed earnings from global operations which in 2006 included onetime tax benefits from planning to use nonus tax net operating losses 

 

a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecs and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

 

because ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings excluding gecs ge pretax earnings from continuing operations excluding gecs earnings from continuing operations were 137 billion 128 billion and 117 billion for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 249 in 2008 218 in 2007 and 219 in 2006 

 

resolution of audit matters reduced the ge effective tax rate throughout this period the effects of such resolutions are included in the following captions in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

 

 

the ge effective tax rate increased from 2007 to 2008 because of the 45 percentage point lower 2008 benefit from favorable audit resolutions partially offset by a 10 percentage point increase in the benefit in lowertaxed earnings from global operations excluding audit resolutions 

 

  

25 

  

the ge effective tax rate declined slightly from 2006 to 2007 because the 35 percentage point higher 2007 benefit from favorable audit resolutions was largely offset by a 33 percentage point decrease in the benefit in lowertaxed earnings from global operations excluding audit resolutions and the effect of tax law changes the 2006 benefit from global operations included tax benefits from planning to use nonus net operating losses against profitable operations 

 

the 2006 ge rate reflects the favorable audit resolutions shown above and the benefit of lowertaxed earnings from global operations including tax benefits from planning to use nonus net operating losses against profitable operations 

 

the gecs effective tax rate was 440 in 2008 compared with 99 in 2007 and 120 in 2006 ge and gecs file a consolidated us federal income tax return that enables ge to use gecs tax deductions and credits to reduce the tax that otherwise would have been payable by ge the gecs effective tax rate for each period reflects the benefit of these tax reductions ge makes cash payments to gecs for these tax reductions at the time ge’s tax payments are due 

 

the gecs rate decreased from 2007 to 2008 primarily because of a reduction during 2008 of income in highertaxed jurisdictions this increased the relative effect of tax benefits from lowertaxed global operations on the tax rate reducing the rate 327 percentage points in addition earnings from lowertaxed global operations increased from 2007 to 2008 causing an additional 207 percentage point rate reduction the increase in the benefit from lowertaxed global operations includes 65 percentage points from the 2008 decision to indefinitely reinvest outside the us prioryear earnings because the use of foreign tax credits no longer required the repatriation of those prioryear earnings 

 

the gecs income tax rate decreased from 2006 to 2007 as the tax benefit on the disposition of its investment in ses and growth in lowertaxed global earnings which decreased the gecs effective tax rate 40 and 10 percentage points respectively were partially offset by higher net tax expense related to us and nonus audit activity and from the absence of the 2006 benefit of the reorganization discussed below of our aircraft leasing business which increased the rate 16 and 11 percentage points respectively 

 

as a result of the repeal of the extraterritorial income eti taxing regime as part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act our aircraft leasing business no longer qualifies for a reduced us tax rate however the act also extended to aircraft leasing the us tax deferral benefits that were already available to other ge nonus active operations these legislative changes coupled with a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and a favorable irish ruling decreased the gecs effective tax rate 11 percentage points in 2006 

 

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization such as ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated it is necessary for us to manage risk at the individual transaction level and to consider aggregate risk at the customer industry geographic and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

 

the ge board of directors maintains overall responsibility for risk oversight with a focus on the most significant risks facing ge the boards audit committee oversees ge’s risk policies and processes relating to the financial statements and financial reporting process the boards public responsibilities committee oversees risks involved in ge’s public policy initiatives the environment and similar matters the board’s management development and compensation committee oversees risk related to compensation 

 

  

26 

  

the board’s oversight process builds upon our management’s risk management and assessment processes which include longterm strategic planning executive development and evaluation regulatory and litigation compliance reviews environmental compliance reviews gecs corporate risk function and the corporate risk committee each year management and the board jointly develop a list of major risks that ge plans to address throughout the year either the board or one of its committees dedicates a portion of their meetings to review and discuss these risk topics in greater detail strategic and operational risks are covered in the ceo’s report on operations to the board at regularly scheduled board meetings at least twice a year the audit committee receives a risk update from the gecs risk officer which focuses on gecs risk strategy and its financial services portfolio including its processes for managing credit and market risk within its portfolio in addition each year and in some years more frequently the audit committee receives a comprehensive report from ge’s treasurer on gecs capital markets exposure and its liquidity and funding risks and a comprehensive report from ge’s general counsel covering compliance issues each year the committee also reviews and discusses topics related to the financial reporting process including an update on information technology controllership insurance tax strategies and policies accounting and numerous reports on regulation compliance litigation and investigations affecting ge businesses 

 

the gecs board of directors oversees the risk management process and approves all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as significant borrowings and investments all participants in the risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the gecs board 

 

the gecs chief risk officer is responsible with the corporate risk function for establishing standards for the measurement reporting and limiting of risk for managing and evaluating risk managers for approving risk management policies and for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization the gecs corporate risk function analyzes certain business risks and assesses them in relation to aggregate risk appetite and approval limits set by the gecs board of directors 

 

threshold responsibility for identifying quantifying and mitigating risks is assigned to our individual businesses we employ proprietary analytic models to allocate capital to our financing activities to identify the primary sources of risk and to measure the amount of risk we will take for each product line this approach allows us to develop early signals that monitor changes in risk affecting portfolio performance and actively manage the portfolio other corporate functions such as controllership financial planning and analysis treasury legal and our corporate audit staff support businesslevel risk management businesses that for example hedge financial risk with derivative financial instruments must do so using our centrally managed treasury function providing assurance that the business strategy complies with our corporate policies and achieves economies of scale we review risks periodically with businesslevel risk managers senior management and our board of directors 

 

dedicated risk professionals across the businesses include underwriters portfolio managers collectors environmental and engineering specialists and specialized asset managers who evaluate leased asset residuals and remarket offlease equipment the senior risk officers have on average over 25 years of experience 

 

we manage a variety of risks including liquidity credit market and government and regulatory risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

27 

  

 

 

other risks include natural disasters availability of necessary materials guarantees of product performance and business interruption these types of risks are often insurable and success in managing these risks is ultimately determined by the balance between the level of risk retained or assumed and the cost of transferring risk to others 

 

our risk management approach has the following major tenets a broad spread of risk based on managed exposure limits senior secured commercial financings and a hold to maturity model with transactions underwritten to our “onbook” standards 

 

the gecc financing portfolios comprise approximately 70 commercial and 30 consumer risk activities with 53 of the portfolio outside the us exposure to developing markets is 11 of the portfolio and is primarily through our eastern european banking operations and mexican commercial financing activities  where we have operated for over 10 years  and various minority owned joint ventures 

 

the commercial portfolio has a maximum single industry concentration of 6 excluding the commercial aircraft financing and the commercial real estate businesses which are diversified separately within their respective portfolios 67 of all commercial exposures are less than 100 million to any one customer while 55 are less than 50 million our commercial aircraft financing business owns 1494 aircraft – 56 are narrow body planes and predominantly newer highdemand models while only 15 are smaller regional jets and older boeing 737 classic aircraft the average age of the fleet is 7 years and our customers include over 230 airlines located in 70 countries leased collateral represents asset types we have over 20 years experience managing 

 

the commercial real estate business consists of a real estate investment portfolio a real estate lending portfolio and a single tenant financing portfolio the real estate investment and lending portfolios are global and consist of approximately 8000 individual properties in 2600 cities in 31 countries with an average property investment of under 10 million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the us consumer portfolio includes privatelabel credit card and sales financing for over 56 million consumers the portfolio includes customers across the us and no metropolitan statistical area accounts for more than 4 of the portfolio the average credit line for the private label portfolio is 600 the nonus portfolio accounts for 80 of all consumer risk activities and includes consumer mortgages auto loans personal loans and credit card financing in 43 countries western europe the uk eastern europe and australianew zealand are the primary nonus markets mortgages represent 43 of the total consumer portfolio the average loantovalue ltv at origination of the total global mortgage portfolio is approximately 74 western europe australia and new zealand ireland and the uk account for approximately 80 of the mortgage book ge employees underwrite all mortgages and originate to hold all mortgages on book we exited the us mortgage business in 2007 

 

the uk mortgage business tightened underwriting criteria throughout 2008 and reduced volume by 54 in response to the weakening home price environment in the uk since mid2006 the first mortgage loans originated in the uk that were greater than 80 ltv are covered by private mortgage insurance for the mortgage balance in excess of 80 insured mortgages account for approximately 73 of the portfolio above 80 ltv at origination 

 

the australianew zealand mortgages are generally prime credit and 94 of the portfolio is covered by private mortgage insurance for the full amount of the mortgage which is customary in this market 

 

  

28 

  

the french mortgage portfolio is generally prime credit and 29 is insured for mortgage loans greater than 80 ltv for the mortgage balance in excess of 80 

 

segment operations 

 

our five segments are focused on the broad markets they serve energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal capital finance and consumer  industrial in addition to providing information on segments in their entirety we have also provided supplemental information for certain businesses within the segments for greater clarity 

 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses inprocess research and development and certain other acquisitionrelated charges and balances technology and product development costs certain gains and losses from dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team 

 

segment profit always excludes the effects of principal pension plans results reported as discontinued operations and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “operating profit” for energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal and consumer  industrial included in determining segment profit which we sometimes refer to as “net earnings” for capital finance 

 

we have reclassified certain priorperiod amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation for additional information about our segments see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

geographic operations 

 

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new profit opportunities potential increased risks include among other things higher receivable delinquencies and bad debts delays or cancellations of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment higher local currency financing costs and slowdown in established financial services activities new profit opportunities include among other things more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

 

revenues are classified according to the region to which products and services are sold for purposes of this analysis us is presented separately from the remainder of the americas we classify certain operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose 

 

geographic revenues 

 

 

 

global revenues rose 13 to 972 billion in 2008 compared with 863 billion and 705 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 53 in 2008 compared with 50 and 47 in 2007 and 2006 respectively the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were to increase revenues by 20 billion 40 billion and 01 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

ge global revenues in 2008 were 594 billion up 19 over 2007 led by increases at energy infrastructure and technology infrastructure primarily in the middle east and africa europe and the pacific basin ge global revenues as a percentage of total ge revenues was 53 in 2008 compared with 50 and 48 in 2007 and 2006 respectively ge global revenues were 498 billion in 2007 up 16 over 2006 led by increases at energy infrastructure and technology infrastructure primarily in the middle east and africa europe and the pacific basin 

 

gecs global revenues rose 4 to 378 billion in 2008 compared with 365 billion and 275 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively gecs global revenues as a percentage of total gecs revenues were 53 in 2008 compared with 51 and 45 in 2007 and 2006 respectively the effects of currency fluctuations on reported results were to increase revenues by 12 billion and 23 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively compared with a decrease of 01 billion in 2006 

 

gecs revenues in the middle east and africa grew 25 in 2008 primarily as a result of organic revenue growth at gecas revenues grew 11 in the americas and 6 in europe in 2008 primarily as a result of organic revenue growth acquisitions and the effects of the weaker us dollar primarily at ge money and cll revenues in the pacific basin remained flat in 2008 from 2007 

 

total assets continuing operations 

 

 

 

total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were 4004 billion in 2008 a decrease of 219 billion or 5 from 2007 gecs global assets on a continuing basis of 3284 billion at the end of 2008 were 10 lower than at the end of 2007 reflecting core declines and the effects of the stronger us dollar in europe the pacific basin and the americas partially offset by acquisitions primarily at ge money and cll 

 

financial results of our global activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

 

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws we are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 03 billion in 2008 and 02 billion in 2007 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of 03 billion to 04 billion over the next two years 

 

in november 2006 the united states federal district court approved a consent decree which had been agreed to by ge and the united states environmental protection agency epa that represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the epa’s 2002 decision to dredge polychlorinated biphenyl pcbcontaining sediments in the upper hudson river the dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after the first phase under the consent decree we have committed to reimburse the epa for its past and future project oversight costs and to perform the first phase of dredging which is scheduled to proceed from may through november of 2009 after completion of the peer review currently scheduled for 2010 we may be responsible for further costs our statement of financial position as of december 31 2008 and 2007 included liabilities for the probable and estimable costs of the agreed upon remediation activities

financial resources and liquidity 

 

this discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the statement of financial position the statement of changes in shareowners’ equity the statement of cash flows contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and debt instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

the fundamental differences between ge and gecs are reflected in the measurements commonly used by investors rating agencies and financial analysts 

 

overview of financial position 

 

major changes to our shareowners’ equity are discussed in the consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity section in addition other significant changes to balances in our statement of financial position follow 

 

statement of financial position 

 

because ge and gecs share certain significant elements of their statements of financial position – property plant and equipment and borrowings for example – the following discussion addresses significant captions in the “consolidated” statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecs activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

 

investment securities comprise mainly investmentgrade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders in our runoff insurance operations and holders of guaranteed investment contracts gics investment securities amounted to 414 billion at december 31 2008 compared with 453 billion at december 31 2007 of the amount at december 31 2008 we held debt securities with an estimated fair value of 339 billion which included residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs and commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs with estimated fair values of 43 billion and 21 billion respectively unrealized losses on debt securities were 54 billion and 11 billion at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively this amount included unrealized losses on rmbs and cmbs of 11 billion and 08 billion at the end of 2008 as compared with 02 billion and an insignificant amount respectively at the end of 2007 unrealized losses increased as a result of continuing market deterioration and we believe primarily represent adjustments for liquidity on investmentgrade securities 

 

of the 43 billion of rmbs our exposure to subprime credit was approximately 13 billion and those securities are primarily held to support obligations to holders of gics a majority of these securities have received investmentgrade credit ratings from the major rating agencies we purchased no such securities in 2008 and an insignificant amount of such securities in 2007 these investment securities are collateralized primarily by pools of individual directmortgage loans and do not include structured products such as collateralized debt obligations additionally a majority of our exposure to residential subprime credit related to investment securities backed by mortgage loans originated in 2006 and 2005 

 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria quantitative criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and for securities with fixed maturities whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security qualitative criteria include the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or until forecasted recovery in addition our evaluation at december 31 2008 considered the continuing market deterioration that resulted in the lack of liquidity and the historic levels of price volatility and credit spreads with respect to corporate bonds we placed greater emphasis on the credit quality of the issuers with respect to rmbs and cmbs we placed greater emphasis on our expectations with respect to cash flows from the underlying collateral and with respect to rmbs we considered the availability of credit enhancements principally monoline insurance our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers 

 

when an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized for a debt security the charge has two components 1 the loss of contractual cash flows due to the inability of the issuer or the insurer if applicable to pay all amounts due and 2 the effects of current market conditions exclusive of credit losses on the fair value of the security principally liquidity discounts and interest rate effects if the expected loss due to credit remains unchanged for the remaining term of the debt instrument the latter portion of the impairment charge is subsequently accreted to earnings as interest income over the remaining term of the instrument when a security is insured a credit loss event is deemed to have occurred if the insurer is expected to be unable to cover its obligations under the related insurance contract

otherthantemporary impairment losses totaled 16 billion in 2008 and 01 billion in 2007 in 2008 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments primarily relating to retained interests in our securitization arrangements rmbs and corporate debt securities of infrastructure financial institutions and media companies in 2007 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments primarily for our retained interests in our securitization arrangements investments in retained interests in securitization arrangements also decreased by 01 billion during 2008 reflecting declines in fair value accounted for in accordance with a new accounting standard that became effective at the beginning of 2007 

 

monoline insurers monolines provide credit enhancement for certain of our investment securities at december 31 2008 our investment securities insured by monolines totaled 31 billion including 11 billion of our 13 billion investment in subprime rmbs although several of the monolines have been downgraded by the rating agencies a majority of the 31 billion is insured by investmentgrade monolines the monoline industry continues to experience financial stress from increasing delinquencies and defaults on the individual loans underlying insured securities we regularly monitor changes to the expected cash flows of the securities we hold and the ability of these insurers to pay claims on securities with expected losses at december 31 2008 if the monolines were unable to pay our anticipated claims based on the expected future cash flows of the securities we would have recorded an impairment charge of 03 billion of which 01 billion would relate to expected credit losses and the remaining 02 billion would relate to other market factors 

 

our qualitative review attempts to identify issuers’ securities that are “atrisk” of impairment that is with a possibility of otherthantemporary impairment recognition in the following 12 months of securities with unrealized losses at december 31 2008 07 billion of unrealized loss was at risk of being charged to earnings assuming no further changes in price and that amount primarily related to investments in rmbs and cmbs securities equity securities securitization retained interests and corporate debt securities of financial institutions and media companies in addition we had approximately 29 billion of exposure to commercial regional and foreign banks primarily relating to corporate debt securities with associated unrealized losses of 04 billion continued uncertainty in the capital markets may cause increased levels of otherthantemporary impairments 

 

at december 31 2008 unrealized losses on investment securities totaled 57 billion including 35 billion aged 12 months or longer compared with unrealized losses of 13 billion including 05 billion aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2007 of the amount aged 12 months or longer at december 31 2008 more than 80 of our debt securities were considered to be investmentgrade by the major rating agencies in addition of the amount aged 12 months or longer 19 billion and 14 billion related to structured securities mortgagebacked assetbacked and securitization retained interests and corporate debt securities respectively with respect to our investment securities that are in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2008 we intend to hold them at least until such time as their individual fair values exceed their amortized cost and we have the ability to hold all such debt securities until their maturities the fair values used to determine these unrealized gains and losses are those defined by relevant accounting standards and are not a forecast of future gains or losses for additional information see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

fair value measurements  effective january 1 2008 we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 157 fair value measurements  for all financial instruments and nonfinancial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis adoption of sfas 157 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during the fourth quarter our methodology remained consistent with prior quarters for measuring fair value of financial instruments trading in volatile markets additional information about our application of sfas 157 is provided in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

working capital  representing ge current receivables and inventories less ge accounts payable and progress collections was 39 billion at december 31 2008 down 25 billion from december 31 2007 reflecting higher progress collections at energy as energy delivers units out of its backlog over the next few years progress collections of 131 billion at december 31 2008 will be earned affecting working capital adversely nonetheless our performance is expected to improve in 2009 as a result of our operating council’s initiatives eg lean projects on cycle time which will significantly offset the decrease in progress collections 

 

we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

 

  

39 

  

current receivables for ge amounted to 151 billion at both the end of 2008 and 2007 and included 113 billion due from customers at the end of 2008 compared with 110 billion at the end of 2007 ge current receivables turnover was 75 in 2008 compared with 73 in 2007 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

inventories for ge amounted to 136 billion at december 31 2008 up 08 billion from the end of 2007 this increase reflected higher inventories from purchases at energy infrastructure ge inventory turnover was 80 and 83 in 2008 and 2007 respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows for purposes of that discussion “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due and “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful 

 

our portfolio of financing receivables is diverse and not directly comparable to major us banks historically we have had less consumer exposure which over time has had higher loss rates than commercial exposure our consumer exposure is largely nonus and primarily comprises mortgage sales finance auto and personal loans in various european and asian countries our us consumer financing receivables comprise 7 of our total portfolio of those approximately 42 relate primarily to credit cards which are often subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements with the retailer the results of which are reflected in gecs revenues and have a smaller average balance and lower loss severity as compared to bank cards the remaining 58 are sales finance receivables which provide electronics recreation medical and home improvement financing to customers in 2007 we exited the us mortgage business and we have no us auto or student loans 

 

our commercial portfolio primarily comprises senior secured positions with comparatively low loss history the secured receivables in this portfolio are collateralized by a variety of asset classes including industrialrelated facilities and equipment commercial and residential real estate vehicles aircraft and equipment used in many industries including the construction manufacturing transportation telecommunications and healthcare industries in addition 2 of this portfolio is unsecured corporate debt 

 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio such estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values and the present and expected future levels of interest rates our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate

the majority of the allowance for losses of 53 billion at december 31 2008 and 42 billion at december 31 2007 is determined based upon a formulaic approach further information on the determination of the allowance for losses on financing receivables is provided in the critical accounting estimates section in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

a portion of the allowance for losses is related to specific reserves on loans that have been determined to be individually impaired under sfas 114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  under sfas 114 individually impaired loans are defined as larger balance or restructured loans for which it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original contractual terms of the loan agreement these specific reserves amount to 06 billion and 04 billion at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively further information pertaining to specific reserves is included in the table below 

 

  

42 

  

 

 

 

the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 3778 billion at december 31 2008 and 3883 billion at december 31 2007 financing receivables before allowance for losses decreased 105 billion from december 31 2007 primarily as a result of commercial and equipment securitization and sales 367 billion the stronger us dollar 294 billion and dispositions 70 billion partially offset by core growth 429 billion and acquisitions 319 billion 

 

related nonearning receivables totaled 80 billion 21 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2008 compared with 55 billion 14 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2007 related nonearning receivables increased from december 31 2007 primarily because of rising unemployment along with the increasingly challenging global economic environment 

 

the allowance for losses at december 31 2008 totaled 53 billion compared with 42 billion at december 31 2007 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and reflecting the then current credit and economic environment allowance for losses increased 11 billion from december 31 2007 primarily because of increasing delinquencies and nonearning receivables reflecting the continued weakened economic and credit environment coincident with the changes in the environment we saw a significant increase in delinquencies in the latter half of 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter as the environment worsened in the latter half of the year we recognized provisions accordingly 

 

cll – equipment and leasing and other nonearning receivables of 15 billion represented 191 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2008 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables declined from 704 at december 31 2007 to 586 at december 31 2008 primarily from an increase in secured exposures which did not require specific reserves based upon the strength of the underlying collateral values 

 

cll – commercial and industrial nonearning receivables of 11 billion represented 141 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2008 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 365 at december 31 2007 to 368 at december 31 2008 the ratio of nonearning receivables as a percentage of financing receivables increased from 13 at december 31 2007 to 18 at december 31 2008 primarily from an increase in nonearning receivables in secured lending in media and communications auto and transportation and consumer manufacturing companies 

 

ge money – nonus residential mortgages nonearning receivables of 33 billion represented 415 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2008 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 100 at december 31 2007 to 115 at december 31 2008 our nonus mortgage portfolio has a loantovalue of approximately 74 at origination and the vast majority are first lien positions in addition we carry mortgage insurance on most first mortgage loans originated at a loantovalue above 80 in 2008 our nonearning receivables increased primarily as a result of the declining uk housing market and our allowance increased accordingly at december 31 2008 we had foreclosed on fewer than 1000 houses in the uk 

 

ge money – us installment and revolving credit nonearning receivables of 08 billion represented 95 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2008 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables increased from 1913 at december 31 2007 to 2243 at december 31 2008 reflecting the effects of the continued deterioration in our us portfolio in connection with rising unemployment 

 

  

43 

  

ge money – nonus auto nonearning receivables of 01 billion represented 1 of total nonearning receivables at december 31 2008 the ratio of allowance for losses as a percent of nonearning receivables decreased from 4320 at december 31 2007 to 2675 at december 31 2008 this is primarily a result of the disposition of our thailand auto business the decision to dispose of our uk auto business and the effects of recoveries 

 

delinquency rates on managed equipment financing loans and leases and managed consumer financing receivables follow 

 

 

 

delinquency rates on equipment financing loans and leases increased from december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 to december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the inclusion of the citicapital acquisition and sanyo acquisition in japan which contributed an additional 12 and 9 basis points respectively at december 31 2008 as well as deterioration in our us commercial middle market and certain european portfolios the current financial market turmoil and tight credit conditions may continue to lead to a higher level of commercial delinquencies and provisions for financing receivables and could adversely affect results of operations at cll 

 

delinquency rates on consumer financing receivables increased from december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 to december 31 2008 primarily because of rising unemployment an increasingly challenging economic environment and lower volume this has resulted in continued deterioration in our us and uk portfolios in response ge money has continued to tighten underwriting standards globally increased focus on collection effectiveness and will continue its process of regularly reviewing and adjusting reserve levels we expect the global environment along with us unemployment levels to continue to deteriorate in 2009 which may result in higher provisions for loan losses and could adversely affect results of operations at ge money at december 31 2008 roughly 40 of our usmanaged portfolio which consisted of credit cards installment and revolving loans was receivable from subprime borrowers we had no us subprime residential mortgage loans at december 31 2008 see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

other gecs receivables totaled 186 billion at december 31 2008 and 221 billion at december 31 2007 and consisted primarily of amounts due from ge generally related to certain material procurement programs of 30 billion at december 31 2008 and 29 billion at december 31 2007 insurance receivables amounts due from qualified special purpose entities qspes nonfinancing customer receivables amounts accrued from investment income amounts due under operating leases and various sundry items 

 

property plant and equipment totaled 785 billion at december 31 2008 up 06 billion from 2007 primarily reflecting acquisitions and additions of commercial aircraft at the gecas business of capital finance ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecs was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

ge additions to property plant and equipment totaled 30 billion in both 2008 and 2007 total expenditures excluding equipment leased to others for the past five years were 145 billion of which 33 was investment for growth through new capacity and product development 31 was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements and 36 was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection 

 

gecs additions to property plant and equipment were 133 billion and 152 billion during 2008 and 2007 respectively primarily reflecting acquisitions and additions of commercial aircraft at the gecas business of capital finance 

 

  

44 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 818 billion and 150 billion respectively at december 31 2008 goodwill increased 06 billion from 2007 primarily from acquisitions – including hydril pressure control by energy infrastructure merrill lynch capital by capital finance and vital signs at technology infrastructure partially offset by the effects of the stronger us dollar and dispositions other intangible assets decreased 12 billion from 2007 primarily from amortization expense and the effects of the stronger us dollar see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

all other assets totaled 1069 billion at yearend 2008 a decrease of 159 billion reflecting decreases in prepaid pension assets assets held for sale and real estate partially offset by increases in derivative instruments and associated companies we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of cost and equity method investments of 05 billion and 01 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively including 02 billion relating to our cost method investment in fgic corporation during 2008 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

liquidity and borrowings 

 

we manage our liquidity to help ensure access to sufficient funding at acceptable costs to meet our business needs and financial obligations throughout business cycles we rely on cash generated through our operating activities as well as unsecured and secured funding sources including commercial paper term debt bank deposits bank borrowings securitization and other retail funding products 

 

the global credit markets have recently experienced unprecedented volatility which has affected both the availability and cost of our funding sources in this current volatile credit environment we have taken a number of initiatives to strengthen our liquidity maintain our dividend and maintain the highest credit ratings specifically we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout this period of volatility we have been able to continue to meet our funding needs at acceptable costs we continue to access the commercial paper markets without interruption 

 

during 2008 gecs and its affiliates issued 843 billion of senior unsecured longterm debt this debt was both fixed and floating rate and was issued to institutional and retail investors in the us and 17 other global markets maturities for these issuances ranged from one to 40 years 

 

  

45 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the fdic adopted the tlgp to address disruptions in the credit market particularly the interbank lending market which reduced banks’ liquidity and impaired their ability to lend the goal of the tlgp is to decrease the cost of bank funding so that bank lending to consumers and businesses will normalize the tlgp guarantees certain newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks thrifts and certain holding companies under the fdic’s final rule adopted on november 21 2008 certain senior unsecured debt issued before june 30 2009 with a maturity of greater than 30 days that matures on or prior to june 30 2012 is automatically included in the program gecc has elected to participate in this program the fees associated with this program range from 50 to 100 basis points on an annualized basis and vary according to the maturity of the debt issuance gecc also pays an additional 10 basis points as it is not an insured depository institution on february 10 2009 in a joint statement the secretary of the treasury the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve the chairman of the fdic the comptroller of the currency and the director of the office of thrift supervision ots announced that for an additional premium the fdic will extend the debt guarantee program of the tlgp through october 2009 

 

included in gecs issuances above is 134 billion of senior unsecured longterm debt issued by gecc in the fourth quarter of 2008 under the tlgp with varying maturities up to june 30 2012 additionally gecc had commercial paper of 218 billion outstanding at december 31 2008 which was issued under the tlgp which is required for all commercial paper issuances with maturities greater than 30 days 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 ge capital extended 218 billion of credit to us customers including 5 million new accounts and 77 billion of credit including unfunded commitments of 25 billion to us companies with an average transaction size of 24 million 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 gecs issued commercial paper into the cpff the last tranche of this commercial paper matures in february 2009 although we do not anticipate further utilization of the cpff it remains available until october 31 2009 we incurred 06 billion of fees for our participation in the tlgp and cpff programs through december 31 2008 

 

our 2009 funding plan anticipates approximately 45 billion of senior unsecured longterm debt issuance in january 2009 we completed issuances of 110 billion funding under the tlgp we also issued 51 billion in nonguaranteed senior unsecured debt with a maturity of 30 years under the nonguarantee option of the tlgp these issuances along with the 134 billion of prefunding done in december 2008 bring our aggregate issuances to 295 billion or 66 of our anticipated 2009 funding plan additionally we anticipate that we will be 90 complete with our 2009 funding plan by june 30 2009 

 

we maintain securitization capability in most of the asset classes we have traditionally securitized however these capabilities have been and continue to be more limited than in 2007 we have continued to execute new securitizations utilizing bank commercial paper conduits securitization proceeds were 178 billion and 768 billion during the three months and the year ended december 31 2008 respectively comparable amounts were 234 billion and 844 billion for the three months and the year ended december 31 2007 respectively 

 

we have successfully grown our alternative funding to 54 billion at december 31 2008 including 36 billion of bank deposits deposits increased by 248 billion since january 1 2008 we have deposittaking capability at nine banks outside of the us and two banks in the us – ge money bank inc a federal savings bank fsb and ge capital financial inc an industrial bank ib the fsb and ib currently issue certificates of deposits cds distributed by brokers in maturity terms from three months to ten years total outstanding cds at these two banks at december 31 2008 were 245 billion we expect deposits to continue to grow and constitute a greater percentage of our total funding in the future 

 

in the event we cannot sufficiently access our normal sources of funding we have a number of alternative sources of liquidity available including cash balances and collections marketable securities and credit lines in the event these sources are not sufficient to repay commercial paper and term debt as it becomes due or to meet our other liquidity needs we can access the cpff and the tlgp andor seek other sources of funding 

 

our cash and equivalents were 482 billion at december 31 2008 we anticipate that we will continue to generate cash from operating activities in the future which is available to help meet our liquidity needs we also generate substantial cash from the principal collections of loans and rentals from leased assets which historically has been invested in asset growth at gecs we are managing collections versus originations to help support liquidity needs and are estimating 25 billion of excess collections in 2009 

 

  

46 

  

committed unused credit lines totaling 600 billion had been extended to us by 65 financial institutions at december 31 2008 these lines include 374 billion of revolving credit agreements under which we can borrow funds for periods exceeding one year additionally 213 billion are 364day lines that contain a termout feature that allows us to extend borrowings for one year from the date of expiration of the lending agreement 

 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are acquiring we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on derivatives marketmaking or other speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that model effects of shifts in rates these are not forecasts 

 

 

 

 

 

consolidated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity 

 

shareowners’ equity decreased by 109 billion in 2008 compared with increases of 41 billion and 29 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

over the threeyear period net earnings increased equity by 174 billion 222 billion and 207 billion partially offset by dividends declared of 126 billion 117 billion and 107 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

elements of other comprehensive income reduced shareowners’ equity by 302 billion in 2008 compared with increases of 51 billion and 01 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively inclusive of changes in accounting principles the components of these changes are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

47 

  

 

 

as discussed in the previous liquidity and borrowings section in the fourth quarter of 2008 we took a number of actions to strengthen our liquidity maintain our dividend and maintain the highest credit ratings on our borrowing capability actions that were taken that affected our 2008 shareowners’ equity included 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these actions other capital increased by 143 billion in 2008 compared with increases of 06 billion and 03 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

overview of our cash flow from 2006 through 2008 

 

consolidated cash and equivalents were 482 billion at december 31 2008 an increase of 325 billion from december 31 2007 cash and equivalents amounted to 157 billion at december 31 2007 an increase of 16 billion from december 31 2006 

 

we evaluate our cash flow performance by reviewing our industrial nonfinancial services businesses and financial services businesses separately cash from operating activities cfoa is the principal source of cash generation for our industrial businesses the industrial businesses also have liquidity available via the public capital markets our financial services businesses use a variety of financial resources to meet our capital needs cash for financial services businesses is primarily provided from the issuance of term debt and commercial paper in the public and private markets as well as financing receivables collections sales and securitizations 

 

ge cash flow 

 

ge cfoa is a useful measure of performance for our nonfinancial businesses and totaled 191 billion in 2008 233 billion in 2007 and 238 billion in 2006 generally factors that affect our earnings – for example pricing volume costs and productivity – affect cfoa similarly however while management of working capital including timing of collections and payments and levels of inventory affects operating results only indirectly the effect of these programs on cfoa can be significant 

 

our ge statement of cash flows shows cfoa in the required format while that display is of some use in analyzing how various assets and liabilities affected our yearend cash positions we believe that it is also useful to supplement that display and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

 

 

 

  

48 

  

the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections increased by 127 billion in 2008 and 122 billion in 2007 these increases are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues comprising energy infrastructure technology infrastructure nbc universal and consumer  industrial analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section is the best way of understanding their customerrelated cfoa 

 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for the wide range of materials and services necessary in a diversified global organization ge operating cash payments increased by 120 billion in 2008 and by 102 billion in 2007 comparable to the increases in ge total costs and expenses 

 

dividends from gecs represented distribution of a portion of gecs retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds from certain business sales and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses which increased in 2008 by 62 billion to 312 billion following an increase of 34 billion in 2007 the amounts we show in ge cfoa are the total dividends including normal dividends as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from gecs business sales beginning in the third quarter of 2008 we reduced our dividend from gecs from 40 to 10 of gecs earnings 

 

ge sells customer receivables to gecs in part to fund the growth of our industrial businesses these transactions can result in cash generation or cash use in any given period the incremental cash generated or used from the sale of customer receivables net effect is the amount of cash received for receivables sold in a period less the amount of cash collected on receivables previously sold this net effect represents the cash generated or used in the period related to this activity the incremental cash generated in ge cfoa from selling these receivables to gecs decreased ge cfoa by 01 billion in 2008 and increased ge cfoa by 03 billion and 20 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for additional information about the elimination of intercompany transactions between ge and gecs 

 

gecs cash flow 

 

gecs cash and equivalents aggregated 375 billion at december 31 2008 compared with 94 billion at december 31 2007 gecs cfoa totaled 312 billion in 2008 compared with 250 billion in 2007 the increase is primarily the result of increased collections of interest from loans and finance leases and rental income from operating leases resulting primarily from core growth and currency exchange and increases in cash collateral received from counterparties on derivative contracts these increases were partially offset by increases in interest payments resulting from increased borrowings and taxes paid 

 

gecs principal use of cash has been investing in assets to grow its businesses of the 286 billion that gecs invested during 2008 174 billion was used for additions to financing receivables 133 billion was used to invest in new equipment principally for lease to others and 250 billion was used for acquisitions of new businesses the largest of which were merrill lynch capital citicapital and bank bph in 2008 this use of cash was partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of property plant and equipment of 110 billion and proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and principal businesses of 101 billion 

 

gecs paid dividends to ge through a distribution of its retained earnings including special dividends from proceeds of certain business sales dividends paid to ge totaled 24 billion in 2008 compared with 73 billion in 2007 there were no special dividends paid to ge in 2008 compared with 24 billion in 2007 during 2008 gecs borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less decreased by 313 billion new borrowings of 1225 billion having maturities longer than 90 days were added during 2008 while 671 billion of such longterm borrowings were retired 

 

intercompany eliminations 

 

effects of transactions between related companies are eliminated and consist primarily of gecs dividends to ge ge customer receivables sold to gecs gecs services for trade receivables management and material procurement buildings and equipment including automobiles leased by ge from gecs information technology it and other services sold to gecs by ge aircraft engines manufactured by ge that are installed on aircraft purchased by gecs from thirdparty producers for lease to others medical equipment manufactured by ge that is leased by gecs to others and various investments loans and allocations of ge corporate overhead costs see note 26 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report for further information related to intercompany eliminations 

 

  

49 

  

the lack of a currentyear counterpart to last year’s 24 billion gecs special dividend and a 25 billion decrease in gecs ordinary dividend are the primary reasons for the decrease in the amount of intercompany eliminations referred to above 

 

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2008 follow 

 

 

 

 

variable interest entities and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we securitize financial assets and arrange other forms of assetbacked financing in the ordinary course of business to improve shareowner returns and as an alternative source of funding the securitization transactions we engage in are similar to those used by many financial institutions beyond improving returns these securitization transactions serve as funding sources for a variety of diversified lending and securities transactions 

 

our securitization activities are conducted using variable interest entities vies principally qspes certain of our vies are consolidated because we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the entity our interests in other vies including qspes and vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for as investment securities financing receivables or equity method investments depending on the nature of our involvement at december 31 2008 consolidated variable interest entity assets and liabilities were 266 billion and 213 billion respectively a decrease of 58 billion and 31 billion from 2007 respectively at december 31 2008 variable interests in unconsolidated vies other than qspes were 29 billion an increase of 12 billion from 2007 our maximum exposure to loss related to such entities at december 31 2008 was 40 billion up 15 billion from 2007 and includes our investment in the unconsolidated vies and our contractual obligations to fund new investments by these entities

qspes that we use for securitization are funded with assetbacked commercial paper and term debt the assets we securitize include receivables secured by equipment commercial real estate credit card receivables floorplan inventory receivables ge trade receivables and other assets originated and underwritten by us in the ordinary course of business at december 31 2008 offbalance sheet securitization entities held 526 billion in transferred financial assets down 36 billion from yearend 2007 assets held by these entities are of equivalent credit quality to our onbook assets we monitor the underlying credit quality in accordance with our role as servicer and apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions with the exception of credit and liquidity support discussed below investors in these entities have recourse only to the underlying assets 

 

at december 31 2008 our statement of financial position included 104 billion in retained interests related to the transferred financial assets discussed above these retained interests are held by qspes and vies for which we are not the primary beneficiary and take two forms 1 sellers’ interests which are classified as financing receivables and 2 subordinated interests designed to provide credit enhancement to senior interests which are classified as investment securities the carrying value of our retained interests classified as financing receivables was 41 billion at december 31 2008 down 01 billion from 2007 the carrying value of our retained interests classified as investment securities was 63 billion at december 31 2008 up 06 billion from 2007 certain of these retained interests are accounted for with changes in fair value recorded in earnings during both 2008 and 2007 we recognized declines in fair value on those retained interests of 01 billion for those retained interests classified as investment securities we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of 03 billion in 2008 compared with 01 billion in 2007 our recourse liability in these arrangements was an inconsequential amount in both 2008 and 2007 

 

we are party to various credit enhancement positions with securitization entities including liquidity and credit support agreements and guarantee and reimbursement contracts and have provided our best estimate of the fair value of estimated losses on such positions the estimate of fair value is based on prevailing market conditions at december 31 2008 should market conditions deteriorate actual losses could be higher our exposure to loss under such agreements was limited to 21 billion at december 31 2008 based on our experience we believe that under any plausible future economic scenario the likelihood is remote that the financial support arrangement we provide to securitization entities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

 

we did not provide support to consolidated vies unconsolidated vies or qspes beyond what we are contractually obligated to provide in either 2008 or 2007 we do not have implicit support arrangements with any vies or qspes 

 

the fasb currently has a project on its agenda that reconsiders the accounting for vies and securitization while final guidance has not yet been issued it is likely that the board will eliminate the scope exclusion in fasb interpretation fin 46r related to qspes which would result in consolidation of a majority of the qspes we use for securitization in addition proposed changes in the criteria for derecognition of financial assets will significantly reduce the number of securitizations that qualify for offbalance sheet treatment and gain recognition a revised standard is expected to be issued later in 2009 and could be effective for our 2010 financial statements further information about our securitization activity and our involvement with qspes is provided in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

debt instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting in december 2008 standard  poor’s ratings services affirmed our and ge capital’s “aaa” longterm and “a1” shortterm corporate credit ratings but revised its ratings outlook from stable to negative based partly on the concerns regarding ge capital’s future performance and funding in light of capital market turmoil on january 24 2009 moody’s investment services placed the longterm ratings of ge and ge capital on review for possible downgrade the firm’s “prime1” shortterm ratings were affirmed moody’s said the review for downgrade is based primarily upon heightened uncertainty regarding ge capital’s asset quality and earnings performance in future periods various debt instruments guarantees and covenants would require posting additional capital or collateral in the event of a ratings downgrade but none are triggered if our ratings are reduced to aaaa3 or a1p1 or higher our objective is to maintain our triplea rating but we do not anticipate any major operational impacts should that change 

 

ge gecs and ge capital have distinct business characteristics that the major debt rating agencies evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively

on november 12 2008 the fdic approved ge capital’s application for designation as an eligible entity under the fdic’s tlgp qualifying debt issued by ge capital is guaranteed under the debt guarantee program of the fdic’s tlgp and is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the fdic’s guarantee under the tlgp is effective until the earlier of the maturity of the debt or june 30 2012 the maximum amount of debt that ge capital is permitted to have issued and outstanding under the debt guarantee program at any time is approximately 126 billion at december 31 2008 ge capital had issued and outstanding 352 billion of senior unsecured debt that was guaranteed by the fdic ge capital and ge entered into an eligible entity designation agreement and ge capital is subject to the terms of a master agreement each entered into with the fdic the terms of these agreements include among other things a requirement that ge and ge capital reimburse the fdic for any amounts that the fdic pays to holders of debt that is guaranteed by the fdic 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if such conditions persist longer or deteriorate further than expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of investment securities goodwill intangibles and longlived assets incremental losses on financing receivables establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio such estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values and the present and expected future levels of interest rates our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or financing leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

 

further information is provided in the global risk management section and financial resources and liquidity – financing receivables section of this item the asset impairment section that follows and in notes 1 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability result in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments decreased earnings by 02 billion in 2008 and increased earnings by 04 billion and 08 billion in 2007 and 2006 respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

 

carrying amounts for product services agreements in progress at both december 31 2008 and 2007 were 55 billion and are included in the line “contract costs and estimated earnings” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria quantitative criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and for securities with fixed maturities whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security qualitative criteria include the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or until forecasted recovery our otherthantemporary impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management functions as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers see note 28 in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report which discusses the determination of fair value of investment securities 

 

further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidity – investment securities section of this item and in notes 1 9 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 

 

commercial aircraft are a significant concentration of assets in capital finance and are particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes we consider market conditions such as global demand for commercial aircraft estimates of future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on current market values from independent appraisers 

 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 01 billion in both 2008 and 2007 provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft were insignificant in 2008 and 2007

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 14 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

real estate we review our real estate investment portfolio for impairment routinely or when events or circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the cash flow estimates used for both estimating value and the recoverability analysis are inherently judgmental and reflect current and projected lease profiles available industry information about expected trends in rental occupancy and capitalization rates and expected business plans which include our estimated holding period for the asset our portfolio is diversified both geographically and by asset type however the global real estate market is subject to periodic cycles that can cause significant fluctuations in market values at december 31 2008 the carrying value of our capital finance real estate investments exceeded the estimated value by about 4 billion at december 31 2007 the estimated value exceeded the carrying value by about 3 billion this decline in the estimated value of the portfolio reflected sales of properties with a book value of 58 billion resulting in pretax gains of 19 billion and also reflected deterioration in current and expected real estate market liquidity and macroeconomic trends throughout the year resulting in declining market occupancy rates and market rents as well as increases in our estimates of market capitalization rates based on historical data declines in estimated value of real estate below carrying value result in impairment losses when the aggregate undiscounted cash flow estimates used in the estimated value measurement are below carrying amount as such estimated losses in the portfolio will not necessarily result in recognized impairment losses when we recognize an impairment the impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the underlying asset which is based upon current market data including current capitalization rates during 2008 capital finance real estate recognized pretax impairments of 03 billion in its real estate held for investment as compared to 02 billion in 2007 continued deterioration in economic conditions or prolonged market illiquidity may result in further impairments being recognized furthermore significant judgment and uncertainty related to forecasted valuation trends especially in illiquid markets results in inherent imprecision in real estate value estimates further information is provided in the global risk management section of this item and in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose all or a portion of a reporting unit determining whether an impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we estimate using a discounted cash flow method for financial services reporting units these cash flows are reduced for estimated interest costs also when determining the amount of goodwill to be allocated to a business disposition for a financial services business we reduce the cash proceeds we receive from the sale by the amount of debt which is allocated to the sold business in order to be consistent with the reporting unit valuation methodology when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results in applying this methodology we rely on a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data 

 

if this analysis indicates goodwill is impaired measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset in this case we supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with independent appraisals as appropriate 

 

given the significant changes in the business climate for financial services and our stated strategy to reduce our capital finance ending net investment we retested goodwill for impairment at the reporting units within capital finance during the fourth quarter of 2008 in performing this analysis we revised our estimated future cash flows and discount rates as appropriate to reflect current market conditions in the financial services industry in each case no impairment was indicated reporting units within capital finance are cll ge money real estate energy financial services and gecas which had goodwill balances at december 31 2008 of 128 billion 91 billion 12 billion 22 billion and 02 billion respectively 

 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows for our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations we periodically test for impairment our deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense 

 

our discount rates for principal pension plans at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 611 634 and 575 respectively reflecting market interest rates 

 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth yields and spreads across a number of potential scenarios assets in our principal pension plans declined 282 in 2008 and had average annual earnings of 33 40 and 101 per year in the five 10 and 25year periods ended december 31 2008 respectively in 2007 assets in our principal pension plans earned 136 and had average annual earnings of 149 92 and 122 per year in the five 10 and 25year periods ended december 31 2007 respectively based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and expected asset allocations we have assumed an 85 longterm expected return on those assets 

 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans follows

income taxes  our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to nonus net operating losses net of valuation allowances were 18 billion and 17 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively such yearend 2008 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established 

 

further information on income taxes is provided in the operations – overview section of this item and in notes 7 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 

 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to thirdparty confirmation 

 

at december 31 2008 derivative assets and liabilities were 126 billion and 52 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 18 23 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report 

 

investments measured at fair value in earnings include retained interests in securitizations accounted for under sfas 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  and equity investments of 26 billion at yearend 2008 the earnings effects of changes in fair value on these assets favorable and unfavorable will be reflected in the period in which those changes occur as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report we have businesses that are held for sale valued at 27 billion at yearend 2008 which represents the estimated fair value less costs to sell those sales are expected to close in the first quarter of 2009 as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report we also have assets that are classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business primarily credit card receivables loans and real estate properties carried at 50 billion at yearend 2008 which represents the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell to the extent that the estimated fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value any favorable or unfavorable changes in fair value will be reflected in earnings in the period in which such changes occur

other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded provision contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators

other information 

 

new accounting standards 

 

on september 15 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a new framework for measuring that value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the standard applied prospectively to new fair value measurements performed after january 1 2008 for measurements of the fair values of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities on january 1 2009 the standard applies to all remaining fair value measurements including nonrecurring valuations of nonfinancial assets and liabilities such as those used in measuring impairments of goodwill other intangible assets and other longlived assets it also applies to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations consummated after january 1 2009 

 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141r business combinations  which is effective for us on january 1 2009 this standard will significantly change the accounting for business acquisitions both during the period of the acquisition and in subsequent periods among the more significant changes in the accounting for acquisitions are the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally the effects of sfas 141r will depend on future acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2008 we expensed an insignificant amount of direct costs related to business combinations that were in process but not completed by the effective date of sfas 141r in december 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas 141ra accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  a proposed fsp which would amend the accounting in sfas 141r for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination the proposed fsp would require that preacquisition contingencies be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined if fair value cannot be reasonably determined the proposed fsp requires measurement based on the best estimate in accordance with sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  

 

also on december 4 2007 the fasb issued sfas 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51 which is effective for us on january 1 2009 this standard will significantly change the accounting and reporting related to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements after adoption noncontrolling interests 89 billion and 80 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively will be classified as shareowners’ equity a change from its current classification between liabilities and shareowners’ equity earnings attributable to minority interests 06 billion in 2008 and 09 billion in both 2007 and 2006 will be included in net earnings although such earnings will continue to be deducted to measure earnings per share purchases and sales of minority interests will be reported in equity similar to treasury stock transactions gains on sales of minority interests that would not have been reported in net earnings under sfas 160 amounted to 04 billion and 09 billion in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

  

58 

  

on december 12 2007 the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue 071 accounting for collaborative arrangements  the consensus provides guidance on presentation of the financial results of a collaborative arrangement including payments between the parties the consensus requires us to present the results of the collaborative arrangement in accordance with eitf issue 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and in the absence of applicable authoritative literature to adopt an accounting policy for payments between the participants that will be consistently applied the consensus is applied retrospectively to all collaborative arrangements existing as of january   1 2009 and covers arrangements in several of our businesses adoption of this standard will not affect our earnings cash flows or financial position 

 

 

supplemental information 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this annual report to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

organic revenue growth in 2008 

 

 

 

  

59 

  

organic revenue growth in 2007 

 

 

 

organic revenue growth in 2006 

 

 

 

organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions business dispositions and currency exchange rates and without the effects of the 2008 and 2006 olympics broadcasts the restatement and immaterial adjustments and reclassifications of discontinued operations we believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions dispositions and currency exchange which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends and the 2008 and 2006 olympics broadcasts the restatement and immaterial adjustments and reclassification of discontinued operations which if included would overshadow trends in ongoing revenues management recognizes that the term “organic revenue growth” may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing periodtoperiod performance trends 

 

  

60 

  

average total shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations a 

 

 

 

 

our rotc calculation excludes earnings losses of discontinued operations from the numerator because us gaap requires us to display those earnings losses in the statement of earnings we exclude the cumulative effect of earnings losses of discontinued operations from the denominator in our rotc calculation 1 for each of the periods for which related discontinued operations were presented and 2 for our average net investment in discontinued operations since july 1 2005 had we disposed of these operations before july 1 2005 we would have applied the proceeds to reduce parentsupported debt at ge capital however since parentsupported debt at ge capital was retired by june 30 2005 we have assumed that we would have distributed the proceeds after that time to shareowners through share repurchases thus reducing average total shareowners’ equity our calculation of average total shareowners’ equity may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies we believe that it is a clearer way to measure the ongoing trend in return on total capital for the continuing operations of our businesses given the extent that discontinued operations have affected our reported results we believe that this results in a more relevant measure for management and investors to evaluate performance of our continuing operations on a consistent basis and to evaluate and compare the performance of our continuing operations with the ongoing operations of other businesses and companies 

 

definitions indicating how the abovenamed ratios are calculated using average total shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations can be found in the glossary 

 

ratio of debt to equity at ge capital net of cash and equivalents and with classification of hybrid debt as equity 

 

 

 

  

61 

  

we have provided the ge capital ratio of debt to equity on a basis that reflects the use of cash and equivalents to reduce debt and with longterm debt due in 2066 and 2067 classified as equity we believe this is a useful comparison to a gaapbased ratio of debt to equity because cash balances may be used to reduce debt and because this longterm debt has equitylike characteristics the usefulness of this supplemental measure may be limited however as the total amount of cash and equivalents at any point in time may be different than the amount that could practically be applied to reduce outstanding debt and it may not be advantageous or practical to replace debt that does not mature for more than 50 years with equity also in february 2009 the ge board authorized a capital contribution of up to 95 billion to ge capital which is expected to be made in the first quarter of 2009 the effect of this capital contribution on ge capital equity is not reflected in the ratio above despite these potential limitations we believe that this measure considered along with the corresponding gaap measure provides investors with additional information that may be more comparable to other financial institutions and businesses

 

ge income tax rate excluding gecs earnings 

 

 

 

reconciliation of us federal statutory income tax rate to ge income tax rate excluding gecs earnings 

 

 

 

we believe that the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings before income taxes excluding the gecs net earnings from continuing operations as ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings management believes that in addition to the consolidated and gecs tax rates shown in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k report this supplemental measure provides investors with useful information as it presents the ge effective tax rate that can be used in comparing the ge results to other nonfinancial services businesses 

 

delinquency rates on certain financing receivables 

 

delinquency rates on managed equipment financing loans and leases and managed consumer financing receivables follow 

 

equipment financing 

 

 

 

 

  

62 

  

consumer 

 

 

 

delinquency rates on onbook and offbook equipment financing loans and leases increased from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 as a result of continuing weakness in the economic and credit environment in addition delinquency rates on onbook equipment financing loans and leases increased from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 as a result of the inclusion of the citicapital acquisition and sanyo acquisition in japan which contributed an additional 12 and 9 basis points respectively at december 31 2008 

 

the increases in offbook and onbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables in the us from december 31 2007 to december 31 2008 reflect the continued rise in delinquencies across the us credit card receivables platforms the increase in onbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables outside of the us reflects the effects of the declining uk housing market the increase in offbook delinquencies for consumer financing receivables in the us from december 31 2006 to december 31 2007 reflected both a change in the mix of the receivables securitized during 2007 – for example our care credit receivables which generally have a higher delinquency rate than our core private label card portfolio – as well as the risk in the delinquencies across the broader portfolio of us credit card receivables 

 

we believe that delinquency rates on managed financing receivables provide a useful perspective of our portfolio quality and are key indicators of financial performance we use this nongaap financial measure because it provides information that enables management and investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of certain financing receivables and facilitates a comparison with the performance of our competitors the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both onbook and offbook portfolios as the customer’s credit performance will affect both loans retained on the statement of financial position and securitized loans we believe that managed basis information is useful to management and investors enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the statement of financial position and our retained interests in securitized loans

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 

 

we are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to approximately 02 billion in both 2007 and 2006 we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of 02 billion to 03 billion over the next two years 

 

the us environmental protection agency epa ruled in february 2002 that approximately 150000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs must be dredged from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state on november 2 2006 the us district court for the northern district of new york approved a consent decree entered into between ge and the epa that represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the epa’s 2002 decision to dredge pcbcontaining sediments in the upper hudson river the dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after phase 1 under this consent decree we have committed up to 01 billion to reimburse the epa for its past and future project oversight costs and agreed to perform the first phase of dredging we further committed that subject to future agreement with the epa about completion of dredging after completion of phase 1 and the peer review we will be responsible for further costs including costs of phase 2 dredging our statement of financial position as of december 31 2007 and 2006 included liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this report 

 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section of our 2007 annual report to shareowners and in the business descriptions in item 1 of this form 10k below we have described certain important strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will determine our future results 

 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic and political risks 

 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world global economic developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways operations are subject to the effects of global competition our global business is affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful 

 

our credit ratings are important to our cost of capital 

 

the major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest debt ratings to us this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting one of our strategic objectives is to maintain our “triple a” ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain our triple a debt ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

 

the success of our business depends on achieving our objectives for strategic acquisitions and dispositions 

 

with respect to acquisitions and mergers we may not be able to identify suitable candidates at terms acceptable to us or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges such as personnel and technology we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which are less than we had anticipated in addition there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations in which case our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value correspondingly we may be too optimistic about a particular business’s prospects in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at a price acceptable to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed enterprise value 

 

  

16 

  

we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 

 

our businesses are subject to regulation by us federal and state laws and foreign laws regulations and policies changes to laws or regulations may even require us to modify our business objectives if existing practices become more restricted subject to escalating costs or prohibited outright particular risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws such as laws that reduce the allowable lending rate or limit consumer borrowing from local liquidity regulations that may increase the risks of not being able to retrieve assets and changes to tax law that may affect our return on investments for example ge’s effective tax rate is reduced because active business income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the united states is taxed at less than the us rate a significant portion of this reduction depends upon a provision of us tax law that defers the imposition of us tax on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the united states as a dividend this provision is consistent with international tax norms and permits us financial services companies to compete more effectively with foreign banks and other foreign financial institutions in global markets this provision which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2008 has been scheduled to expire on four previous occasions and each time it has been extended by congress if this provision is not extended the current us tax imposed on active financial services income earned outside the united states would increase making it more difficult for us financial services companies to compete in global markets our businesses and the industries in which we operate are also at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

 

changes in the real estate markets are highly uncertain 

 

we provide financing for the acquisition refinancing and renovation of various types of properties we also consider opportunities to buy and sell properties which may result in significant outlays or proceeds of cash either individually or in the aggregate the profitability of real estate investments is largely dependent upon the specific geographic market in which they are located and the perceived value of that market at the time of sale we may have difficulty optimizing that mix and such activity may vary significantly from one year to the next

 item 3 

legal proceedings 

tableend 

 

as previously reported in january 2005 the staff of the us securities and exchange commission sec informed us that it had commenced an investigation and requested certain documents and information with respect to the use of hedge accounting for derivatives by us and ge capital in august 2005 the sec staff advised us that the sec had issued a formal order of investigation in the matter the sec staff has taken testimony in this matter and has requested information about other ge accounting policies and practices including items related to revenue recognition 

 

  

17 

  

in connection with the sec’s investigation we are conducting an internal review of revenue recognition matters our review has been thorough and extensive continuing for more than a year and has been conducted using substantial internal and external resources these resources have included extensive redeployment of our 430 person audit staff to focus on this review substantial time and resources of our controllership and finance organizations and our internal legal organization accounting and expert support from our auditor kpmg and extensive resources from outside legal counsel and accounting expertise who have advised us and our audit committee we have regularly reported results of the review to the sec staff as conclusions have been reached and in cases where errors have been identified we have publicly disclosed them in our filings with the sec 

 

in a form 8k filed january 18 2008 we reported that we had determined that we made an error in the manner in which we changed our accounting for profits on certain aftermarket spare parts as we reported under longterm product services agreements we provide repair and maintenance for installed products including spare parts we recognize revenue and profits over the contract period in proportion to our contract costs an element of our contract costs is the cost of spare parts before january 1 2002 our aviation business accounted for the profits on spare parts installed pursuant to longterm product service agreements either in its spare parts unit or in its revenue recognition model for commercial engines effective january 1 2002 with the concurrence of kpmg we changed our accounting for spare parts in two ways that largely offset to exclude all spare parts from the model for engine sales and to include margin in longterm services agreements to the extent spare parts are associated with such agreements 

 

in making this change we changed our estimate of the unperformed portions of longterm product services agreements to use our cost instead of catalogue list price we have determined that because we did not also recompute our pre2002 spare parts costs on the same basis we overestimated the percentage of completion of affected agreements and underestimated the related contract profit rates an error that resulted in accelerating revenues and profits attributable to such agreements in 2002 and understating revenues and profits in some future periods similar adjustments in the accounting method for estimating the cost of spare parts installed pursuant to longterm services agreements were made by aviation in 2003 with respect to spare parts manufactured by a joint venture partner and in our energy business in 2006 we also reported that we had determined that for periods prior to 2004 we made an error in our application and description of appropriate revenue measurement principles in certain infrastructure businesses our associated routines and controls failed to prevent or detect these errors 

 

we and our audit committee with the assistance of the committee’s independent counsel have evaluated the circumstances surrounding and the effect on our previously reported financial statements of the items reported in our january 18 2008 form 8k and have determined that the adjustments relating to these items both individually and together with the adjustments for the errors identified in our form 10qs filed on july 27 2007 and november 2 2007 are not material to our financial statements and have determined that restatement of our prior period financial statements is not required we have included the adjustments for these items in prior period financial information reported in this form 10k 

 

we also have considered these matters in context of our review of our internal control over financial reporting and have concluded that the internal control deficiencies implicated by the items identified above constitute significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting but do not individually or in the aggregate with other identified deficiencies constitute a material weakness in the company’s internal control 

 

  

18 

  

we and our audit committee take these internal control matters very seriously and are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and procedures in response to these matters we and our audit committee have been actively engaged in the planning and implementation of remediation efforts to address the identified deficiencies in our internal controls with respect to our revenue recognition policies and procedures and to enhance our overall control environment we have already undertaken and are continuing to implement a number of remedial actions and internal control enhancements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we continue to cooperate with the ongoing sec investigation and to discuss the investigation and issues arising in that investigation and our internal review with the sec staff with a goal of completing our review and resolving these matters as soon as practicable our senior management and audit committee are monitoring the review closely with the assistance of outside counsel and accounting experts we and our audit committee are committed to addressing issues that arise and to providing transparent disclosure to our investors concerning these matters 

 

  the antitrust division of the department of justice doj and the sec are continuing to conduct an industrywide investigation of marketing and sales of guaranteed investment contracts and other financial instruments to municipalities in connection with this investigation two subsidiaries of ge capital received subpoenas in 2006 ge funding cms trinity funding co received a subpoena from the doj requesting documents and ge funding capital market services inc received a subpoena from the sec that requests similar information about trinity funding company llc the company is cooperating fully with the sec and doj in this matter

as previously reported in april 2006 the us environmental protection agency epa informed the company that it was contemplating seeking 990000 in penalties for violations of the clean air act at its recently sold mt vernon indiana plastics facility epa has asserted that the company failed to adequately control emissions from valves and inlet pipes in an underground piping system we disagree with those assertions and epa has already modified its position to reduce the number of potential violations based on conversations with ge the company has engaged in settlement discussions with the agency over both the nature and severity of the alleged violations

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10ka or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report 

 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate discussion about the important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section in item 7 and in the business descriptions in item 1 of this form 10ka below we have described our present view of certain important strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will determine our future results 

 

22 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways operations are subject to the effects of global competition particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws and from local liquidity regulations including risks of not being able to retrieve assets our global business is affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful 

 

our credit ratings are important to our cost of capital 

 

the major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest debt ratings to us one of our strategic objectives is to maintain these “triple a” ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain our triple a debt rating could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins 

 

the disposition of businesses that do not fit with our evolving strategy can be highly uncertain 

 

we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives our decisions to sell genworth and ge insurance solutions are recent examples of disposition decisions when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which are less than we had anticipated in addition there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations in which case our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value correspondingly we may be too optimistic about a particular business’s prospects in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at a price acceptable to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed enterprise value

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

2007 restatement 

 

as discussed in the explanatory note to this form 10ka and in note 1 to our financial statements we are restating financial statements and other financial information for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 and financial information for the years 2002 and 2001 and for each of the quarters in the years 2005 and 2004 the restatement adjusts our accounting for interest rate swap transactions related to a portion of the commercial paper issued by general electric capital corporation gecc and general electric capital services inc gecs each whollyowned subsidiaries of ge from january 1 2001 the date we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended the restatement has no effect on our cash flows or liquidity and its effects on our financial position at the ends of the respective restated periods are immaterial 

 

interest rate swaps  agreements under which we pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a floating rate of interest on an agreed notional amount  are used in meeting our objective of managing interest rate risk related to our commercial paper program many of our financial assets  such as loans and leases  have longterm fixedrate yields and funding them with proceeds of commercial paper would expose us to interest rate risk interest rate swaps are used to manage this risk we use commercial paper in connection with interest rate swaps because that financing structure is highly effective at fixing interest rates enabling us to match fixed rate assets with fixed rate funding or “match funding” provided by the hedged commercial paper consistent with our hedge documentation we had measured and recognized hedge ineffectiveness each reporting period we had never used the shortcut treatment provided for in sfas 133 for any of these hedges 

 

the following table sets forth the effects of the error in accounting for interest rate swaps related to our commercial paper hedging program more fully described beginning on page 3 on our previously reported earnings for the years 2001 through 2005 and each of the quarters in the years 2004 and 2005 

 

 

 

28 

 

 

 

changes to our previously reported earnings detailed above reflect the volatility resulting from recognizing changes in the fair value of our commercial paper interest rate swaps immediately in earnings rather than recording them in earnings over the remaining term of the hedging relationship values of these swaps move directly with changes in interest rates increases in interest rates produce positive earnings effects from fair value gains on the interest rate swaps as the amount of cash we receive on the swaps’ variable cash flow stream increases versus its fixed payment stream similarly negative earnings effects result from fair value losses on the swaps associated with decreases in interest rates as the amount of cash received on the swaps’ variable cash flow stream decreases versus its fixed payment stream interest rates generally trended downward during the period from 2001 to the present explaining the slightly negative effect on earnings from this accounting error correction however interest rates were volatile within the years  for example increasing sharply in the second quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005 resulting in more pronounced positive earnings effects in those periods as these swaps are used in match funding arrangements which protect against the economic exposure to changes in interest rates there are offsetting fair value changes associated with the related fixed rate assets because fair value changes related to fixed rate assets are not recognized in earnings under the current accounting model the elimination of hedge accounting through correction of the error presents the current earnings effects of only one of two equal and offsetting components of the economic relationship 

 

the effects of these corrections resulted in a cumulative earnings decrease of 05 billion through december 31 2005 all of which were related to interest rate swaps used in our commercial paper hedging program reversal of these cumulative adjustments will affect net earnings positively over the terms of the underlying interest rate swaps but to a degree that we do not expect to be significant in any individual period given the terms of the arrangements and actions taken to eliminate the accounting volatility by modifying the documentation in a manner that will enable the swaps to qualify for hedge accounting effective january 1 2007

overview of our earnings from 2003 through 2005 

 

our results over the last several years reflect the global economic environment in which we operate during these years the economy has grown but at a rate that in historic terms has been relatively modest longterm interest rates have been stable we also experienced a weaker but recently strengthening us dollar escalating energy costs and higher fossil fuelrelated raw material prices market developments in two industries in which we operatepower generation and commercial aviation  also had significant effects on our results as the following pages show our diversification and risk management strategies enabled us to continue to grow revenues and earnings to record levels during this challenging time 

 

of our six segments infrastructure 29 and 36 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively was one of the most significantly affected by the recent economic environment infrastructure’s energy business was particularly affected by the period of unprecedented us power industry demands that peaked in 2002 the return to normal demand levels was reflected in subsequent lower shipments of large heavyduty gas turbine units in 2003 we sold 175 such units compared with 122 in 2004 and 127 in 2005 during these years we invested in other lines of power generation such as wind power and developed product services that we believe will position the energy business well for continued growth in 2006 and beyond we also continued to invest in marketleading technology and services at aviation transportation and water we had 1405 commercial aircraft on lease at december 31 2005 an increase of 63 aircraft from last year all of our aircraft were on lease at the end of 2005 and at that time we held 106 billion list price of multipleyear orders for various boeing airbus and other aircraft including 73 aircraft 48 billion list price scheduled for delivery in 2006 all under agreement to commence operations with commercial airline customers product services and sales of our evolution series locomotives continue to be strong 

 

industrial 22 and 10 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively is particularly sensitive to economic conditions higher capacity in combination with declining or weak volume growth in many of the industries in which it operates resulted in increased competitive price pressures the consumer  industrial business continued to grow through product innovation and its focus on highend appliances the plastics business was hit particularly hard during these three years because of additional pressure from significant inflation in natural gas and certain raw materials such as benzene increased earnings at plastics reflected improved product pricing 

 

30 

we have achieved strong growth in our healthcare and nbc universal segments with a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions healthcare 10 and 11 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively realized benefits of acquisitions of amersham plc amersham in 2004 and instrumentarium in 2003 expanding the breadth of our product and services offerings to the healthcare industry and positioning us well for continued growth nbc universal 9 and 13 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively has developed into a diversified worldclass media company over the last several years as the combination of nbc with vivendi universal entertainment lllp vue in 2004 followed successful acquisitions of telemundo and bravo in 2002 nbc universal revenues and segment profit rose 14 and 21 respectively in 2005 and 88 and 28 respectively in 2004 largely on acquisitions we expect the technology and business model for the entertainment media industry to continue to evolve in the coming years and believe that nbc universal is well positioned to compete in this challenging environment 

 

commercial finance and consumer finance together 26 and 31 of consolidated threeyear revenues and total segment profit respectively are large profitable growth businesses in which we continue to invest with confidence in a challenging economic environment these businesses grew earnings by a combined 13 billion and 10 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively commercial finance and consumer finance have delivered strong results through solid core growth disciplined risk management and successful acquisitions the most significant acquisitions affecting commercial finance and consumer finance results in 2005 were the commercial lending business of transamerica finance corporation wmc finance co wmc a us wholesale mortgage lender australian financial investments group afig a residential mortgage lender in australia and the transportation financial services group of citicapital these acquisitions collectively contributed 19 billion and 02 billion to 2005 revenues and net earnings respectively 

 

overall acquisitions contributed 96 billion 123 billion and 54 billion to consolidated revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our consolidated net earnings in 2005 2004 and 2003 included approximately 09 billion 12 billion and 05 billion respectively from acquired businesses we integrate acquisitions as quickly as possible only revenues and earnings from the date we complete the acquisition through the end of the fourth following quarter are attributed to such businesses dispositions also affected our operations through lower revenues of 20 billion 30 billion and 23 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this resulted in lower earnings of 01 billion and 05 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively and higher earnings of 02 billion in 2003 

 

significant matters relating to our statement of earnings are explained below 

 

insurance exit in 2005 we reduced our exposure to insurance in a disciplined fashion and our exit is now in sight 

 

  

  

31 

we reported both the portions of ge insurance solutions described above and genworth as discontinued operations for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated we refer to captions such as revenues and earnings from continuing operations simply as “revenues” and “earnings” throughout this management’s discussion and analysis similarly discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

 

we declared 96 billion in dividends in 2005 pershare dividends of 091 were up 11 from 2004 following a 6 increase from the preceding year in december 2005 our board of directors raised our quarterly dividend 14 to 025 per share we have rewarded our shareowners with over 100 consecutive years of dividends with 30 consecutive years of dividend growth and our dividend growth for the past five years has significantly outpaced that of companies in the standard  poor’s sp 500 stock index 

 

except as otherwise noted the analysis in the remainder of this section presents the results of ge with gecs included on a oneline basis and gecs see the segment operations section for a more detailed discussion of the businesses within ge and gecs 

 

ge sales of product services were 274 billion in 2005 a 9 increase over 2004 increases in product services in 2005 and 2004 were widespread led by continued strong growth at infrastructure and healthcare operating profit from product services was approximately 70 billion in 2005 up 14 from 2004 reflecting ongoing improvements at infrastructure and healthcare 

 

postretirement benefit plans reduced pretax earnings by 17 billion 12 billion and 02 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively costs of our principal pension plans increased over the last three years primarily because of the effects of 

 

  

  

considering current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of assets in which our plans are invested we have assumed that longterm returns on our principal pension plan assets would be 85 throughout this period and in 2006 us generally accepted accounting principles provide for recognition of differences between assumed and actual returns over a period no longer than the average future service of employees 

 

we believe that our postretirement benefit costs will increase again in 2006 for a number of reasons including further reduction in discount rates at december 31 2005 and continued recognition of prior years investment losses relating to our principal pension plans 

 

32 

our principal pension plans had a surplus of 58 billion at december 31 2005 we will not make any contributions to the ge pension plan in 2006 to the best of our ability to forecast the next five years we do not anticipate making contributions to that plan so long as expected investment returns are achieved at december 31 2005 the fair value of assets for our other pension plans was 29 billion less than their respective projected benefit obligations we expect to contribute 04 billion to these plans in 2006 the same amount that was contributed in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans and future effects on operating results depend on economic conditions and investment performance see notes 6 and 7 for additional information about funded status components of earnings effects and actuarial assumptions see the critical accounting estimates section for discussion of pension assumptions 

 

ge other costs and expenses are selling general and administrative expenses which increased 11 to 133 billion in 2005 following a 22 increase in 2004 substantially the result of acquisitions in both years 

 

ge operating profit is earnings from continuing operations before interest and other financial charges income taxes and the effects of accounting changes ge operating profit was 133 billion in 2005 up from 114 billion in 2004 and 116 billion in 2003 144 137 and 164 of ge total revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in 2005 operating profit reflected higher productivity principally healthcare and infrastructure volume infrastructure and nbc universal and prices industrial partially offset by higher other costs across all segments the decrease in 2004 reflected the combination of higher material and other costs industrial and nbc universal higher pension costs lower prices infrastructure and healthcare and lower productivity infrastructure and nbc universal partially offset by increased volume nbc universal and healthcare reflecting 2004 combinationacquisition activity 

 

restated interest on borrowings and other financial charges amounted to 151 billion 116 billion and 104 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively substantially all of our borrowings are through gecs where interest expense was 143 billion 111 billion and 99 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively changes over the threeyear period reflected increased average borrowings and increased interest rates gecs average borrowings were 3461 billion 3192 billion and 3050 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively gecs average composite effective interest rate was 42 in 2005 compared with 35 in 2004 and 32 in 2003 proceeds of these borrowings were used in part to finance asset growth and acquisitions in 2005 gecs average assets of 4870 billion were 10 higher than in 2004 which in turn were 15 higher than in 2003 see the financial resources and liquidity section for a discussion of interest rate risk management 

 

restated income taxes 

 

income taxes are a significant cost as a global commercial enterprise our tax rates are affected by many factors including our global mix of earnings legislation acquisitions dispositions and tax characteristics of our income our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions 

 

33 

income taxes on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes were 180 in 2005 compared with 182 in 2004 and 224 in 2003 our consolidated income tax rate was essentially unchanged in 2005 from 2004 because the 2005 tax benefits from a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and from the growth in lowertaxed global operations were about the same as the 2004 tax benefits from favorable us internal revenue service irs settlements the nbc universal combination the 2004 reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and a lower tax rate on the sale of a portion of gecis our business process outsourcing operation now genpact our consolidated income tax rate decreased by 42 percentage points in 2004 as the benefits listed above for 2004 were greater than the tax benefits from certain business dispositions in 2003 a more detailed analysis of differences between the us federal statutory rate and the consolidated rate as well as other information about our income tax provisions is provided in note 8 the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge and for gecs and a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow 

 

because ge tax expense does not include taxes on gecs earnings the ge effective tax rate is best analyzed in relation to ge earnings excluding gecs ge pretax earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes excluding gecs earnings from continuing operations before accounting changes were 119 billion 104 billion and 107 billion for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively on this basis ge’s effective tax rate was 231 in 2005 190 in 2004 and 267 in 2003 the increase in the 2005 rate over the 2004 rate was primarily attributable to the lack of currentyear counterparts to the 2004 settlements with the irs and 2004 tax benefits associated with the nbc universal combination both discussed below that together reduced the 2004 rate by 72 percentage points partially offsetting this increase were the favorable impact of a number of audit resolutions with taxing authorities and our 2005 repatriation of earnings at the reduced us tax rate provided in 2004 legislation together representing a 32 percentage point reduction of the ge tax rate these 2005 tax benefits are reflected in note 8 in the lines “all other  net” 16 percentage points and “tax on global activities including exports” 16 percentage points 

 

the 2004 rate reduction was primarily a result of two items that decreased the 2004 ge tax rate by 72 percentage pointssettling several issues with the irs for the years 1985 through 1999 and tax benefits associated with the nbc universal combination as part of the irs settlements we closed two significant issues the 1997 taxfree exchange of the lockheed martin convertible preferred stock we received on the disposition of our aerospace business in 1993 and a 1998 tax loss on the sale of a puerto rican subsidiary the tax portion of these settlements is included in the line “irs settlements of lockheed martin taxfree exchangepuerto rico subsidiary loss” in note 8 the tax benefits associated with the nbc universal combination are included in the line “all other  net” in note 8 the 2004 ge effective tax rate also reflects lower pretax income primarily from lower earnings in the energy business and higher costs related to our principal pension plans partially offsetting these changes was the nonrecurrence of certain 2003 tax benefits 

 

gecs effective tax rate decreased to 123 in 2005 from 175 in 2004 and 161 in 2003 the 2005 gecs rate reflects the net benefits discussed below of a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and an increase in lowertaxed earnings from global operations together these items more than account for the 66 percentage point decrease in rate from 2004 reflected in the line “tax on global activities including exports” in note 8 partially offsetting these benefits was the nonrecurrence of the benefits from 2004 favorable settlements with the irs and the lowtaxed disposition of a majority interest in genpact the lack of counterparts to these items increased the 2005 gecs tax rate by 17 percentage points 

 

34 

the increase in the gecs effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 also reflected the net benefits discussed below of a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 16 percentage points and is included in the line “tax on global activities including exports” in note 8 tax benefits from favorable irs settlements which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 12 percentage points and is included in the line “all other  net” in note 8 and the lowtaxed disposition of a majority interest in genpact which decreased the 2004 effective tax rate 08 percentage points and is included in the line “tax on global activities including exports” in note 8 offsetting these benefits were the effects of higher pretax income and the nonrecurrence of a 2003 tax benefit on the disposition of shares of erc life reinsurance corporation 

 

as a result of the repeal of the extraterritorial income eti taxing regime as part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act our aircraft leasing business no longer qualifies for a reduced us tax rate however the act also extended to aircraft leasing the us tax deferral benefits that were already available to other ge nonus active operations these legislative changes coupled with a reorganization of our aircraft leasing business and a favorable irish tax ruling decreased the gecs effective tax rate 28 percentage points in 2005 and 16 percentage points in 2004 

 

global risk management 

 

a disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organization such as ours in order to ensure that we are executing according to our strategic objectives and that we only accept risk for which we are adequately compensated it is necessary for us to manage risk at the individual transaction level and to consider aggregate risk at the customer industry geography and collateraltype levels where appropriate 

 

the ge board of directors oversees the risk management process through clearly established delegation of authority board and committee meeting agendas are jointly developed with management to cover risk topics presented to our corporate risk committee including environmental compliance liquidity credit market and event risks 

 

the gecs board of directors oversees the risk management process for financial services and approves directly or by delegation all significant acquisitions and dispositions as well as borrowings and investments all participants in the risk management process must comply with approval limits established by the board 

 

the gecs chief risk officer is responsible through the corporate risk function for establishing standards for the measurement reporting and limiting of risk for managing and evaluating risk managers for approving risk management policies and for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization the gecs corporate risk function analyzes certain business risks and assesses them in relation to aggregate risk appetite and approval limits set by the gecs board of directors 

 

threshold responsibility for identifying quantifying and mitigating risks is assigned to our individual businesses because the risks and their interdependencies are complex we apply a six sigmabased analytical approach to each major product line that monitors performance against external benchmarks proactively manages changing circumstances provides early warning detection of risk and facilitates communication to all levels of authority other corporate functions such as financial planning and analysis treasury legal and our corporate audit staff support businesslevel risk management businesses that for example hedge financial risk with derivative financial instruments must do so using our centrallymanaged treasury function providing assurance that the business strategy complies with our corporate policies and achieves economies of scale we review risks periodically with businesslevel risk managers senior management and our board of directors 

 

35 

gecs employs about 11000 dedicated risk professionals including 6600 involved in collection activities and 400 specialized asset managers who evaluate leased asset residuals and remarket offlease equipment 

 

ge and gecs manage a variety of risks including liquidity credit market and event risks 

 

  

  

  

  

segment operations 

 

operating segments comprise our six businesses focused on the broad markets they serve infrastructure industrial healthcare nbc universal commercial finance and consumer finance for segment reporting purposes certain gecs businesses are included in the industrial operating segments that actively manage such businesses and report their results for internal performance measurement purposes these include aviation financial services energy financial services and transportation finance reported in the infrastructure segment and equipment services reported in the industrial segment 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we commenced reporting businesses affected by our insurance exit as discontinued operations for all periods presented these businesses were previously reported in the commercial finance segment also during the fourth quarter of 2005 our insurance activities previously reported in the commercial finance segment were transferred to corporate items and eliminations for all periods presented 

 

36 

segment profit is determined based on internal performance measures used by the chief executive officer to assess the performance of each business in a given period in connection with that assessment the chief executive officer may exclude matters such as charges for restructuring rationalization and other similar expenses inprocess research and development and certain other acquisitionrelated charges and balances technology development costs certain gains and losses from dispositions and litigation settlements or other charges responsibility for which preceded the current management team 

 

segment profit always excludes the effects of principal pension plans and results reported as discontinued operations and accounting changes segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment’s management is measuredexcluded in determining segment profit which we refer to as “operating profit” for healthcare nbc universal and the industrial businesses of the industrial and infrastructure segments included in determining segment profit which we refer to as “net earnings” for commercial finance consumer finance and the financial services businesses of the industrial segment equipment services and the infrastructure segment aviation financial services energy financial services and transportation finance

infrastructure revenues increased 2 or 08 billion in 2004 as the weaker us dollar 05 billion primarily at energy and higher volume 04 billion were partially offset by lower prices 06 billion at the industrial businesses of the segment primarily at energy the increase in volume was the net result of increased sales in commercial services and military engines at aviation and locomotives at transportation partially offset by lower sales at energy energy sold 122 large heavyduty gas turbines in 2004 compared with 175 in 2003 financial services activity primarily at aviation financial services and energy financial services increased revenues primarily from organic revenue growth 04 billion and acquisitions 01 billion 

 

39 

segment profit fell 8 or 06 billion in 2004 as lower material costs 03 billion primarily at energy and higher volume 01 billion were more than offset by lower prices 06 billion and lower productivity 06 billion at the industrial businesses of the segment the lower productivity was the net effect of lower productivity at energy primarily from the anticipated decline in higher margin gas turbine sales and a decrease in customer contract termination fees partially offset by higher productivity at aviation segment profit from the financial services businesses primarily energy financial services increased 01 billion as a result of core growth 

 

infrastructure orders were 384 billion in 2005 up from 340 billion in 2004 the 292 billion total backlog at yearend 2005 comprised unfilled product orders of 188 billion of which 65 was scheduled for delivery in 2006 and product service orders of 104 billion scheduled for 2006 delivery comparable december 31 2004 total backlog was 278 billion of which 182 billion was for unfilled product orders and 96 billion for product services orders

corporate items and eliminations include the effects of eliminating transactions between operating segments results of our insurance activities remaining in continuing operations cost of and cost reductions from our principal pension plans results of liquidating businesses such as consolidated liquidating securitization entities underabsorbed corporate overhead certain nonallocated amounts described below and a variety of sundry items corporate items and eliminations is not an operating segment rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to consolidated totals on the financial statements 

 

43 

the caption “gecs commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment” consists of fair value changes associated with interest rate swaps that were designated as hedges of our commercial paper program as more fully described beginning on page 28 the correction of our financial statements to eliminate the effects of hedge accounting for these swaps results in recognition in earnings of such fair value changes immediately rather than over the remaining term of the hedging relationship certain amounts included in the line “other” above are not allocated to ge operating segments because they are excluded from the measurement of their operating performance for internal purposes in 2004 these comprised 04 billion of healthcare charges principally related to the writeoff of inprocess research and development projects and other transitional costs associated with amersham and a 01 billion charge at industrial as the gain on sale of the motors business was more than offset by costs for inventory obsolescence and other charges in 2003 amounts not allocated to ge operating segments included charges of 02 billion for settlement of litigation restructuring and other charges at healthcare and 01 billion for restructuring and other charges at industrial

our global activities span all geographic regions and primarily encompass manufacturing for local and export markets import and sale of products produced in other regions leasing of aircraft sourcing for our plants domiciled in other global regions and provision of financial services within these regional economies thus when countries or regions experience currency andor economic stress we often have increased exposure to certain risks but also often have new profit opportunities potential increased risks include among other things higher receivable delinquencies and bad debts delays or cancelations of sales and orders principally related to power and aircraft equipment higher local currency financing costs and slowdown in established financial services activities new profit opportunities include among other things more opportunities for lower cost outsourcing expansion of industrial and financial services activities through purchases of companies or assets at reduced prices and lower us debt financing costs 

 

estimated results of global activities include the results of our operations located outside the united states plus all us exports we classify certain gecs operations that cannot meaningfully be associated with specific geographic areas as “other global” for this purpose 

 

global revenues by region 

 

 

 

 

 

global revenues rose 16 to 779 billion in 2005 compared with 669 billion and 543 billion in 2004 and 2003 respectively global revenues to external customers as a percentage of consolidated revenues were 48 in 2005 compared with 45 and 44 in 2004 and 2003 respectively the effects of the weaker us dollar on reported results were to increase revenues by 09 billion 41 billion and 31 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and to increase earnings by 01 billion 01 billion and 02 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

ge global revenues were 482 billion in 2005 up 15 over 2004 led by increases at infrastructure and nbc universal mainly in europe and the pacific basin exports from the us were up 30 led by infrastructure again showing strength in europe and the pacific basin ge global revenues in 2004 were 417 billion up 27 over 2003 led by healthcare including the effects of the amersham acquisition and nbc universal reflecting the combination of nbc and vue us exports grew 31 in 2004 on strong growth at infrastructure 

 

45 

gecs global revenues were 297 billion 252 billion and 213 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively gecs revenues in the pacific basin increased 28 in 2005 primarily as a result of the acquisition of afig at consumer finance and organic revenue growth at consumer finance and commercial finance gecs revenues increased 25 in europe primarily as a result of higher investment income largely offset by policyholder dividends at our insurance activities and organic revenue growth and acquisitions at consumer finance and commercial finance revenues in other global decreased 4 primarily as a result of the absence of a currentyear counterpart to the 2004 gain on the sale of a majority interest in genpact partially offset by organic revenue growth at the financial services businesses in infrastructure 

 

global operating profit was 127 billion in 2005 an increase of 20 over 2004 which was 35 higher than in 2003 ge global operating profit in 2005 rose 30 reflecting solid growth in europe and other global mainly at infrastructure 

 

total assets of global operations on a continuing basis were 2994 billion in 2005 an increase of 28 billion or 1 over 2004 gecs global assets on a continuing basis of 2619 billion at the end of 2005 were 1 higher than at the end of 2004 reflecting acquisitions and core growth almost fully offset by the recently strengthening us dollar 

 

financial results of our global activities reported in us dollars are affected by currency exchange we use a number of techniques to manage the effects of currency exchange including selective borrowings in local currencies and selective hedging of significant crosscurrency transactions such principal currencies are the pound sterling the euro the japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

 

environmental matters 

 

our operations like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses involve the use disposal and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 

 

we are involved in a sizable number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws such statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site expenditures for site remediation actions amounted to 01 billion in each of the last two years we presently expect that such remediation actions will require average annual expenditures in the range of 02 billion to 03 billion over the next two years 

 

the us environmental protection agency epa ruled in february 2002 that approximately 150000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs must be dredged from a 40mile stretch of the upper hudson river in new york state on october 6 2005 ge and the epa entered into and filed in the us district court for the northern district of new york a consent decree that subject to approval of that court represents a comprehensive framework for implementation of the epa’s 2002 decision to dredge pcbcontaining sediments in the upper hudson river the dredging will be performed in two phases with an intervening peer review of performance after phase 1 under this consent decree we have committed up to 01 billion to reimburse the epa for its past and future project oversight costs and agreed to perform the first phase of dredging we further committed that subject to future agreement with the epa about completion of dredging after completion of phase 1 and the peer review we will be responsible for further costs including costs of phase 2 dredging our statement of financial position as of december 31 2005 and 2004 included liabilities for the estimated costs of this remediation

financial resources and liquidity 

 

this discussion of financial resources and liquidity addresses the statement of financial position the statement of changes in shareowners’ equity the statement of cash flows contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and debt instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

the fundamental differences between ge and gecs are reflected in the measurements commonly used by investors rating agencies and financial analysts these differences will become clearer in the discussion that follows with respect to the more significant items in the financial statements 

 

overview of financial position 

 

major changes in our financial position resulted from the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

statement of financial position 

 

because ge and gecs share certain significant elements of their statements of financial positionproperty plant and equipment and borrowings for examplethe following discussion addresses significant captions in the “consolidated” statement within the following discussions however we distinguish between ge and gecs activities in order to permit meaningful analysis of each individual consolidating statement 

 

47 

investment securities comprise mainly availableforsale investmentgrade debt securities supporting obligations to annuitants and policyholders and debt and equity securities designated as trading and associated with certain nonus insurance contractholders who retain the related investment risks and rewards except in the event of our bankruptcy or liquidation investment securities were 531 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 569 billion at december 31 2004 

 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and for fixed maturities whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security qualitative criteria include the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer as well as our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or until forecasted recovery our impairment reviews involve our finance risk and asset management teams as well as the portfolio management and research capabilities of our internal and thirdparty asset managers our qualitative review attempts to identify those issuers with a greater than 50 chance of default in the following 12 months these securities are characterized as “atrisk” of impairment of availableforsale securities with unrealized losses at december 31 2005 approximately 01 billion was at risk of being charged to earnings in the next 12 months substantially all of this amount related to the automotive and commercial aviation industries 

 

impairment losses for 2005 totaled 01 billion compared with 02 billion in 2004 we recognized impairments in both periods for issuers in a variety of industries we do not believe that any of the impairments indicate likely future impairments in the remaining portfolio 

 

gross unrealized gains and losses were 25 billion and 05 billion respectively at december 31 2005 compared with 29 billion and 05 billion respectively at december 31 2004 primarily reflecting a decrease in the estimated fair value of debt securities as interest rates increased at december 31 2005 available accounting gains could be as much as 07 billion net of consequential adjustments to certain insurance assets that are amortized based on anticipated gross profits the market values we used in determining unrealized gains and losses are those defined by relevant accounting standards and should not be viewed as a forecast of future gains or losses see note 10 

 

we also hold collateralized investment securities issued by various airlines including those operating in bankruptcy total amortized cost of these securities was 17 billion at december 31 2005 and total fair value was 16 billion unrealized losses totaling 01 billion were associated with securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months an improvement from the comparable 03 billion a year earlier all of these securities have remained current on all payment terms we do not expect the borrowers to default current appraised market values of associated aircraft collateral exceeded both the market value and the amortized cost of our related securities at december 31 2005 offering protection in the event of foreclosure therefore we expect full recovery of our investment as well as our contractual returns 

 

working capital representing ge inventories and receivables from customers less trade payables and progress collections was 84 billion at december 31 2005 up 01 billion from december 31 2004 reflecting the effects of 2005 acquisitions 

 

we discuss current receivables and inventories two important elements of working capital in the following paragraphs 

 

48 

current receivables for ge amounted to 151 billion at the end of 2005 and 145 billion at the end of 2004 and included 103 billion due from customers at the end of 2005 compared with 102 billion at the end of 2004 turnover of customer receivables from sales of goods and services was 90 in 2005 compared with 94 in 2004 other current receivables are primarily amounts that did not originate from sales of ge goods or services such as advances to suppliers in connection with large contracts see note 11 

 

inventories for ge amounted to 103 billion at december 31 2005 up 07 billion from the end of 2004 this increase reflected higher inventories at aviation and the effects of 2005 acquisitions ge inventory turnover was 83 in 2005 compared with 84 in 2004 see note 12 

 

financing receivables is our largest category of assets and represents one of our primary sources of revenues the portfolio of financing receivables before allowance for losses was 2922 billion at december 31 2005 and 2883 billion at december 31 2004 the related allowance for losses at december 31 2005 amounted to 46 billion compared with 56 billion at december 31 2004 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the allowance for losses decreased 10 billion from 2004 the 2005 decrease reflected writeoffs of previously reserved financing receivables 08 billion principally commercial aviation loans and leases in our infrastructure segment and the recently strengthening us dollar 02 billion during 2005 changes in us bankruptcy laws prompted certain customers to accelerate filing for bankruptcy protection these changes had an inconsequential effect on our allowance and earnings balances at december 31 2005 and 2004 included securitized managed ge trade receivables of 39 billion and 35 billion respectively see notes 13 and 14 

 

a discussion of the quality of certain elements of the financing receivables portfolio follows for purposes of that discussion “delinquent” receivables are those that are 30 days or more past due “nonearning” receivables are those that are 90 days or more past due or for which collection has otherwise become doubtful and “reducedearning” receivables are commercial receivables whose terms have been restructured to a belowmarket yield 

 

commercial finance financing receivables before allowance for losses totaled 1318 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 1245 billion at december 31 2004 and consisted of loans and leases to the equipment and leasing commercial and industrial and real estate industries this portfolio of receivables increased primarily from core growth 399 billion and acquisitions 106 billion partially offset by securitizations and sales 373 billion and the recently strengthening us dollar 20 billion related nonearning and reducedearning receivables were 13 billion 10 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2005 and 14 billion 11 of outstanding receivables at yearend 2004 commercial finance financing receivables are generally backed by assets and there is a broad spread of geographic and credit risk in the portfolio 

 

consumer finance financing receivables before allowance for losses were 1301 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 1278 billion at december 31 2004 and consisted primarily of card receivables installment loans auto loans and leases and residential mortgages this portfolio of receivables increased primarily as a result of core growth 113 billion and acquisitions 04 billion partially offset by the recently strengthening us dollar 78 billion securitizations 07 billion loans transferred to assets held for sale 05 billion and dispositions 04 billion nonearning consumer receivables were 28 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 25 billion at december 31 2004 representing 21 and 20 of outstanding receivables respectively the increase was primarily related to higher nonearning receivables in our european secured financing business a business that tends to experience relatively higher delinquencies but lower losses than the rest of our consumer portfolio 

 

49 

infrastructure financing receivables before allowance for losses were 191 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 209 billion at december 31 2004 and consisted primarily of loans and leases to the commercial aircraft and energy industries related nonearning and reducedearning receivables were insignificant at december 31 2005 down from 02 billion 08 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2004 

 

other financing receivables before allowance for losses were 112 billion and 151 billion at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively and consisted primarily of financing receivables in consolidated liquidating securitization entities this portfolio of receivables decreased because we have stopped transferring assets to these entities nonearning receivables at december 31 2005 were 01 billion 07 of outstanding receivables compared with 02 billion 12 of outstanding receivables at december 31 2004 

 

delinquency rates on managed commercial finance equipment loans and leases and managed consumer finance financing receivables follow 

 

 

 

delinquency rates at commercial finance decreased from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 primarily resulting from improved credit quality across all portfolios the increase from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004 reflected the effect of certain acquired portfolios partially offset by improvement in the overall core portfolio 

 

delinquency rates at consumer finance increased from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 as a result of higher delinquencies in our european secured financing business discussed above the decrease from december 31 2003 to december 31 2004 reflected the results of the standardization of our writeoff policy the acquisition of afig and the us acquisition of wmc with lower relative delinquencies as a result of whole loan sales partially offset by higher delinquencies in our european secured financing business discussed above see notes 13 and 14 

 

other gecs receivables totaled 191 billion at december 31 2005 and 150 billion at december 31 2004 and consisted primarily of nonfinancing customer receivables insurance receivables amounts due from ge generally related to certain material procurement programs amounts due under operating leases receivables due on sale of securities and various sundry items 

 

property plant and equipment amounted to 675 billion at december 31 2005 up 44 billion from 2004 primarily reflecting acquisitions of commercial aircraft at the aviation financial services business of infrastructure ge property plant and equipment consisted of investments for its own productive use whereas the largest element for gecs was equipment provided to third parties on operating leases details by category of investment are presented in note 15 

 

ge expenditures for plant and equipment during 2005 totaled 28 billion compared with 24 billion in 2004 total expenditures for the past five years were 127 billion of which 32 was investment for growth through new capacity and product development 37 was investment in productivity through new equipment and process improvements and 31 was investment for other purposes such as improvement of research and development facilities and safety and environmental protection 

 

50 

gecs additions to property plant and equipment were 116 billion and 107 billion during 2005 and 2004 respectively primarily reflecting additions of commercial aircraft at the aviation financial services business of infrastructure and vehicles at commercial finance and the equipment services business of industrial 

 

intangible assets were 817 billion at yearend 2005 up from 785 billion at yearend 2004 ge intangibles increased 31 billion from 547 billion at the end of 2004 principally as a result of goodwill and other intangibles related to the edwards systems technology acquisition by industrial the ionics inc acquisition by infrastructure and the acquisitions of an additional interest in msnbc and the previously outstanding minority interest in vue by nbc universal gecs intangibles increased 02 billion to 239 billion at december 31 2005 resulting from goodwill associated with acquisitions partially offset by the recently strengthening us dollar and purchase accounting adjustments see note 16 

 

all other assets totaled 874 billion at yearend 2005 a decrease of 21 billion reflecting nbc universal settling obligations related to preferred interests previously issued by vue and dispositions affecting real estate partially offset by increases in assets held for sale see notes 16 and 17 

 

consolidated borrowings amounted to 3704 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 3651 billion at the end of 2004 

 

ge total borrowings were 102 billion at yearend 2005 11 billion short term 91 billion long term compared with 110 billion at december 31 2004 ge total debt at the end of 2005 equaled 81 of total capital compared with 90 at the end of 2004 

 

gecs borrowings amounted to 3621 billion at december 31 2005 of which 1577 billion is due in 2006 and 2044 billion is due in subsequent years comparable amounts at the end of 2004 were 3555 billion in total 1543 billion due within one year and 2012 billion due thereafter included in gecs total borrowings were borrowings of consolidated liquidating securitization entities amounting to 168 billion and 258 billion at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively a large portion of gecs borrowings 974 billion and 969 billion at the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively was issued in active commercial paper markets that we believe will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing the average remaining terms and interest rates of ge capital commercial paper were 45 days and 409 at the end of 2005 compared with 42 days and 239 at the end of 2004 the ge capital ratio of debt to equity was 709 to 1 at the end of 2005 and 646 to 1 at the end of 2004 see note 18 

 

exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of straightforward techniques including match funding and selective use of derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world and local funding is not always efficient in addition we use derivatives to adjust the debt we are issuing to match the fixed or floating nature of the assets we are acquiring we apply strict policies to manage each of these risks including prohibitions on derivatives trading derivatives marketmaking or other speculative activities following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates using socalled “shock” tests that model effects of shifts in rates these are not forecasts

restated statement of changes in shareowners’ equity 

 

shareowners’ equity decreased 16 billion in 2005 and increased 312 billion in 2004 and 157 billion in 2003 changes over the threeyear period were largely attributable to net earnings partially offset by dividends declared of 96 billion 86 billion and 78 billion in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in 2005 we purchased 53 billion of ge stock 1533 million shares under our 25 billion share repurchase program in 2004 we issued 3417 million shares of stock in connection with the amersham acquisition which increased equity by 107 billion and 1194 million shares of stock to partially fund the combination of nbc and vue which increased equity by 38 billion currency translation adjustments decreased equity by 43 billion in 2005 compared with a 39 billion increase in 2004 changes in currency translation adjustments reflect the effects of changes in currency exchange rates on our net investment in nonus subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the us dollar in 2005 the us dollar strengthened against the pound sterling and euro in 2004 the pound sterling euro and to a lesser extent asian currencies strengthened against the us dollar see note 23 accumulated currency translation adjustments affect net earnings only when all or a portion of an affiliate is disposed of or substantially liquidated 

 

overview of our cash flow from 2003 through 2005 

 

ge cash from operating activities cfoa is a useful measure of performance for our nonfinancial businesses and totaled 216 billion in 2005 152 billion in 2004 and 129 billion in 2003 generally factors that affect our earningsfor example pricing volume costs and productivityaffect cfoa similarly however while management of working capital including timing of collections and payments and levels of inventory affects operating results only indirectly the effect of these programs on cfoa can be significant excluding progress collections working capital improvements benefited cfoa by 28 billion since 2002 as we applied our lean six sigma and other working capital management tools broadly 

 

our ge statement of cash flows shows cfoa in the required format while that display is of some use in analyzing how various assets and liabilities affected our yearend cash positions we believe that it is also useful to supplement that display and to examine in a broader context the business activities that provide and require cash 

 

52 

 

 

the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customerrelated activities the largest of which is collecting cash following a product or services sale ge operating cash collections increased by 83 billion during 2005 and by 132 billion during 2004 these increases are consistent with the changes in comparable ge operating segment revenues comprising healthcare nbc universal and the industrial businesses of the industrial and infrastructure segments and which also reflect the effects of the second quarter 2004 acquisition of amersham and combination of nbc and vue analyses of operating segment revenues discussed in the preceding segment operations section is the best way of understanding their customerrelated cfoa 

 

the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for the wide range of material and services necessary in a diversified global organization ge operating cash payments increased in 2005 by 66 billion and by 106 billion in 2004 comparable to the increases in ge total costs and expenses and also reflect the second quarter 2004 acquisition of amersham and combination of nbc and vue 

 

dividends from gecs represented distribution of a portion of gecs retained earnings including proceeds from certain business sales and are distinct from cash from continuing operating activities within the financial services businesses which increased in 2005 by 08 billion to 209 billion and in 2004 by 61 billion to 201 billion the amount we show in cfoa is the total dividend including the normal dividend as well as any special dividends from excess capital primarily resulting from gecs business sales financial services cash is not necessarily freely available for alternative uses for example use of cash generated by our regulated activities is often restricted by such regulations further any reinvestment in financing receivables is shown in cash used for investing activities not operating activities therefore maintaining or growing financial services assets requires that we invest much of the cash they generate from operating activities in their earning assets 

 

based on past performance and current expectations in combination with the financial flexibility that comes with a strong balance sheet and the highest credit ratings we believe that we are in a sound position to grow dividends continue to execute our 25 billion share repurchase program which is an expansion of the 15 billion share repurchase program announced in 2004 and continue making selective investments for longterm growth 

 

53 

contractual obligations 

 

as defined by reporting regulations our contractual obligations for future payments as of december 31 2005 follow 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we use offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business to improve shareowner returns these securitization transactions also serve as funding sources for a variety of diversified lending and securities transactions our securitization transactions are similar to those used by many financial institutions 

 

in a typical securitization transaction we sell assets to a special purpose entity spe which has obtained cash by issuing beneficial interests usually debt to third parties securitization entities commonly use derivatives such as interest rate swaps to match interest rate characteristics of the assets with characteristics of the related beneficial interests an example is an interest rate swap that serves to convert fixed rate assets to a variable rate matching the cash flows on spe floating rate debt an investor in a beneficial interest usually has recourse to assets in the associated spe and often benefits from credit enhancements supporting those assets the most common credit enhancement is overcollateralization where we securitize a greater principal amount of assets than debt issued by the spe our other credit enhancements are in the form of liquidity and credit support agreements and guarantee and reimbursement contracts we have provided 01 billion at yearend 2005 representing our best estimate of the fair value of potential losses under these arrangements 

 

54 

historically we executed securitization transactions using entities sponsored by us and by third parties beginning in 2003 we only have executed securitization transactions with third parties in the assetbacked commercial paper and term markets securitization entities hold receivables secured by equipment commercial and residential real estate credit card and trade receivables and other assets our total securitized assets at yearend 2005 amounted to 617 billion a 35 billion increase from yearend 2004 of that total the offbalance sheet amount was 438 billion up 116 billion from december 31 2004 and the amount in consolidated liquidating securitization entities was 179 billion down 81 billion from december 31 2004 reflecting repayments see note 28 for further information 

 

we have extensive experience in evaluating economic liquidity and credit risk related to the assets we securitize assets held by these entities are of high quality and we actively monitor them in accordance with our servicing role we apply rigorous controls to the execution of securitization transactions and continuously monitor developments affecting credit in view of our experience and taking into consideration the historical depth and liquidity of global commercial paper markets we believe that under any plausible future economic scenario the likelihood is remote that the financial support arrangements we provide to securitization entities could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 

 

debt instruments guarantees and covenants 

 

the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the debt of ge gecs and ge capital the major borrowing affiliate of gecs these agencies have given the highest debt ratings to ge and ge capital longterm rating aaaaaa shortterm rating a1p1 one of our strategic objectives is to maintain these ratings as they serve to lower our cost of funds and to facilitate our access to a variety of lenders we manage our businesses in a fashion that is consistent with maintaining these ratings 

 

ge gecs and ge capital have distinct business characteristics that the major debt rating agencies evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively 

 

quantitative measures include 

 

  

  

  

  

qualitative measures include 

 

  

  

 

55 

 

 

  

ge capital’s ratings are supported contractually by a ge commitment to maintain the ratio of earnings to fixed charges at a specified level as described below 

 

as of january 1 2003 we extended a businessspecific marketbased leverage to the performance measurement of each of our financial services businesses as a result at january 1 2003 debt of 125 billion previously allocated to our financial services segments was allocated to corporate items and eliminations we refer to this as “parentsupported debt” as of december 31 2004 32 billion of such debt remained and was paid down during the first quarter of 2005 

 

during 2005 gecs paid 39 billion of special dividends to ge which was a portion of the proceeds from the genworth secondary public offerings 

 

during 2005 ge issued 15 billion of senior unsecured threeyear floating rate debt the proceeds were used primarily for repayment of maturing longterm debt during 2005 gecs and gecs affiliates issued 58 billion of senior unsecured longterm debt and 2 billion of subordinated debt this debt was both fixed and floating rate and was issued to institutional and retail investors in the us and 15 other global markets maturities for these issuances ranged from one to 40 years we used the proceeds primarily for repayment of maturing longterm debt but also to fund acquisitions and organic growth we anticipate that we will issue between 55 billion and 65 billion of additional longterm debt during 2006 mostly to repay maturing longterm debt the ultimate amount we issue will depend on our needs and on the markets 

 

following is the composition of gecs debt obligations excluding any assetbacked debt obligations such as debt of consolidated liquidating securitization entities 

 

 

 

we target a ratio for commercial paper of 25 to 35 of outstanding debt based on the anticipated composition of our assets and the liquidity profile of our debt ge capital is the most widely held name in global commercial paper markets 

 

we believe that alternative sources of liquidity are sufficient to permit an orderly transition from commercial paper in the unlikely event of impaired access to those markets funding sources on which we would rely would depend on the nature of such a hypothetical event but include 572 billion of contractually committed lending agreements with 75 highlyrated global banks and investment banks total credit lines extending beyond one year increased 03 billion to 571 billion at december 31 2005 see note 18 

 

56 

beyond contractually committed lending agreements other sources of liquidity include medium and longterm funding monetization asset securitization cash receipts from our lending and leasing activities shortterm secured funding on global assets and potential sales of other assets 

 

principal debt conditions are described below 

 

the following two conditions relate to ge and gecs 

 

  

  

the following three conditions relate to consolidated liquidating securitization entities 

 

  

  

  

one group of consolidated spes holds high quality investment securities funded by the issuance of gics if the longterm credit rating of ge capital were to fall below aaaa3 or its shortterm credit rating were to fall below a1p1 ge capital could be required to provide up to 41 billion of capital to such entities 

 

in our history we have never violated any of the above conditions either at ge gecs or ge capital we believe that under any reasonable future economic developments the likelihood that any such arrangements could have a significant effect on our operations cash flows or financial position is remote 

 

57 

ge’s total research and development expenditures were 34 billion in 2005 compared with 31 billion and 27 billion in 2004 and 2003 respectively in 2005 expenditures from ge’s own funds were 27 billion compared with 24 billion in 2004 expenditures funded by customers mainly the us government were 07 billion and 06 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

expenditures reported above reflect the definition of research and development required by us generally accepted accounting principles for operating and management purposes we consider amounts spent on product and services technology to include our reported research and development expenditures but also amounts for improving our existing products and services and the productivity of our plant equipment and processes on this basis our technology expenditures in 2005 were 52 billion 

 

ge’s total backlog of firm unfilled orders at the end of 2005 was 361 billion an increase of 6 from yearend 2004 reflecting increased demand for wind turbines locomotives and product services of the total backlog 238 billion related to products of which 70 was scheduled for delivery in 2006 product services orders included in this reported backlog for only the succeeding 12 months were 123 billion at the end of 2005 orders constituting this backlog may be canceled or deferred by customers subject in certain cases to penalties see the segment operations section for further information 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties for all of these estimates we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

 

losses on financing receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio such estimate requires consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates financial health of specific customers and market sectors collateral values and the present and expected future levels of interest rates our risk management process which includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations ensures that relevant data are identified and considered either for individual loans or leases or on a portfolio basis as appropriate 

 

our lending and leasing experience and the extensive data we accumulate and analyze facilitate estimates that have proven reliable over time our actual loss experience was in line with expectations for 2005 2004 and 2003 while prospective losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions we do not anticipate significant adverse credit development in 2006 further information is provided in the financial resources and liquidityfinancing receivables section the asset impairment section that follows and in notes 1 13 and 14

revenue recognition on longterm agreements to provide product services product services agreements requires estimates of profits over the multipleyear terms of such agreements considering factors such as the frequency and extent of future monitoring maintenance and overhaul events the amount of personnel spare parts and other resources required to perform the services and future billing rate and cost changes we routinely review estimates under product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook we also regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract costs and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and the close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions that affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability will also result in an immediate adjustment of earnings we provide for probable losses 

 

carrying amounts for product services agreements in progress at december 31 2005 and 2004 were 44 billion and 37 billion respectively and are included in the line “contract costs and estimated earnings” in note 17 adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on product services agreements have been insignificant for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005

asset impairment assessment involves various estimates and assumptions as follows 

 

investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value the duration of that market decline our intent and ability to hold to maturity or until forecasted recovery and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer we perform comprehensive market research and analysis and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments further information about actual and potential impairment losses is provided in the financial resources and liquidityinvestment securities section and in notes 1 and 10 

 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset’s residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans to determine fair value we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 

 

59 

commercial aircraft are a significant concentration of assets in infrastructure and are particularly subject to market fluctuations therefore we test recoverability of each aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually additionally we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when aircraft are released current lease terms have changed or a specific lessee’s credit standing changes future rentals and residual values are based on historical experience and information received routinely from independent appraisers estimated cash flows from future leases are reduced for expected downtime between leases and for estimated technical costs required to prepare aircraft to be redeployed fair value used to measure impairment is based on current market values from independent appraisers 

 

we recognized impairment losses on our operating lease portfolio of commercial aircraft of 03 billion and 01 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition to these impairment charges relating to operating leases we recorded provisions for losses on financing receivables related to commercial aircraft of 02 billion in 2005 primarily related to northwest airlines corporation northwest airlines and 03 billion in 2004 primarily related to us airways and ata holdings corp 

 

certain of our commercial aviation customers are operating under bankruptcy protection while they implement steps to return to profitable operations with a lower cost structure at december 31 2005 our largest exposures to carriers operating in bankruptcy were to delta air lines 24 billion ual corp 14 billion and northwest airlines 13 billion our financial exposures to these carriers are substantially secured by various boeing airbus and bombardier aircraft and operating equipment on february 1 2006 ual corp emerged from bankruptcy protection 

 

further information on impairment losses and our exposure to the commercial aviation industry is provided in the operationsoverview section and in notes 10 15 and 29 

 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit determining whether an impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we estimate using a discounted cash flow method when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results in applying this methodology we rely on a number of factors including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data 

 

if this analysis indicates goodwill is impaired measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset in this case we supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with independent appraisals as appropriate 

 

we test other identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptionsdiscount rate and expected return on assetsare important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 

 

to reflect market interest rate conditions we reduced our discount rate for principal pension plans at december 31 2005 from 575 to 550 and at december 31 2004 from 60 to 575 

 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets assets in our principal pension plans earned 102 in 2005 and had average annual earnings of 47 101 and 118 per year in the five 10 and 25year periods ended december 31 2005 respectively we believe that these results in connection with our current and expected asset allocations support our assumed longterm return of 85 on those assets 

 

sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our principal pension plans follows 

 

  

  

further information on our pension plans is provided in the operationsoverview section and in note 7 

 

derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks including risks related to interest rates foreign exchange and commodity prices accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting the accounting guidance related to derivatives accounting is complex failure to apply this complex guidance correctly will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings while offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item are reported in earnings only upon realization regardless of whether the hedging relationship is economically effective 

 

61 

in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing for a relationship that does not meet these criteria we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset within a specified range changes in the fair value of the hedged item this test is conducted on a cumulative basis each reporting period if fair value changes fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions subject to third party confirmation 

 

at december 31 2005 derivative assets and liabilities were 19 billion and 22 billion respectively further information about our use of derivatives is provided in notes 1 18 and 27 

 

other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded provision contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators further information is provided in notes 20 and 29 

 

other information 

 

new accounting standard 

 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment sfas 123r which will be effective for us on january 1 2006 among other things sfas 123r requires expensing the fair value of stock options previously optional accounting that we adopted voluntarily in 2002 the transitional effect of this provision of sfas 123r will be modest consisting of a reduction in fullyear 2006 net earnings of 9 million to expense the unvested portion of options granted in 2001 sfas 123r also will require us to change the classification of certain tax benefits from sharebased compensation deductions to financing rather than operating cash flows while the effects of these future tax deductions will depend on several variables had sfas 123r been in effect approximately 03 billion would have been required to be classified as financing not operating cash flows in both 2005 and 2004 prior periods will not be restated as a result of this accounting change 

 

financial measures that supplement generally accepted accounting principles 

 

we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap certain of these data are considered “nongaap financial measures” under us securities and exchange commission rules specifically we have referred in various sections of this annual report to 

 

  

  

  

 

62 

 

 

  

  

the reasons we use these nongaap financial measures and their reconciliation to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow 

 

restated organic revenue growth 

 

 

 

 

growth in industrial cfoa 

 

 

 

restated ge tax rate excluding gecs earnings 

 

 

 

63 

we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat in some cases shortterm patterns and longterm trends may be obscured by large factors or events for example events or trends in a particular segment may be so significant as to obscure patterns and trends of our industrial or financial services businesses in total for this reason we believe that investors may find it useful to see our 2005 revenue growth without the effect of acquisitions dispositions currency exchange rates and the effects of the gecs commercial paper interest rate swap adjustment and without the effects of the 2004 olympics broadcasts and the may 2005 sfas 133 correction which effects have no counterpart in 2005 and if included would overshadow trends in ongoing revenues similarly we believe that investors would find it useful to compare our 2005 operating cash flow against our 2004 operating cash flow without the impact of gecs dividends 

 

delinquency rates on certain financing receivables 

 

delinquency rates on managed commercial finance equipment loans and leases and managed consumer finance financing receivables follow 

 

commercial finance 

 

 

 

consumer finance 

 

 

 

we believe that delinquency rates on managed financing receivables provide a useful perspective on our on and offbook portfolio quality and are key indicators of financial performance 

 

average total shareowners’ equity excluding effects of discontinued operations a 

 

 

64 

 

 

us gaap requires earnings of discontinued operations to be displayed separately in the statement of earnings accordingly the numerators used in our calculations of returns on average shareowners’ equity and average total capital invested presented in selected financial data on pages 26 and 27 exclude those earnings losses further we believe it is appropriate to exclude from the denominators specifically the average total shareowners’ equity component the cumulative effect of those earnings losses since 2000 for each of the five years for which such returns are presented as well as our average net investment in discontinued operations for the second half of 2005 only had we disposed of these operations before mid2005 proceeds would have been applied to reduce parentsupported debt at ge capital however since parentsupported debt at ge capital was retired in the first half of 2005 we have assumed that any proceeds after that time would have been distributed to shareowners by means of share repurchases thus reducing average total shareowners’ equity

 item 9a controls and procedures   

 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

in connection with the restatement discussed above in the explanatory note to this form 10ka and in note 1 to our financial statements under the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we reevaluated our disclosure controls and procedures we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to accounting for hedge transactions namely that we did not have adequately designed procedures to designate with the specificity required under sfas 133 each hedged commercial paper transaction   solely as a result of this material weakness we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2005 

 

as of january 1 2007 we modified our commercial paper hedging program and adopted documentation for interest rate swaps that we believe complies with the requirements of sfas 133 and remediated the related internal control weakness in connection with this amended form 10k under the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as currently in effect including the remedial actions discussed above and we have concluded that as of this date our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

 

as previously reported there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2005 that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

b management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as restated 

 

the management of general electric company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the framework and criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 filed on march 3 2006 management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 subsequently management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to accounting for hedge transactions namely that we did not have adequately designed procedures to designate with the specificity required under sfas 133 each hedged commercial paper transaction 

 

144 

this material weakness resulted in this amendment to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 in order to restate the financial statements for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 and to restate financial information for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 and each of the quarters in 2005 and 2004 

 

solely as a result of this material weakness our management has revised its earlier assessment and has now concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2005 

 

general electric company’s independent auditor kpmg llp a registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our management’s revised assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 this audit report follows 

 

145 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

to shareowners and board of directors of general electric company 

 

we have audited management’s restated assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as restated that general electric company and consolidated affiliates “ge” did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 because of the effect of the material weakness identified in management’s restated assessment based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” ge management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of ge’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected management has identified and included in its restated assessment the following material weakness as of december 31 2005 a failure to ensure adequately designed procedures to designate with the specificity required by statement of financial accounting standards no 133 each hedged commercial paper transaction this material weakness resulted in restatements of the companys previously issued consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2005 and 2004 and for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 and the financial information for each of the quarters in 2005 and 2004 

 

146 

as stated in the fourth paragraph of management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting as restated management’s assessment of the effectiveness of ge’s internal control over financial reporting has been restated 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the statement of financial position of general electric company and consolidated affiliates as of december 31 2005 and 2004 and the related statements of earnings changes in shareowners’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 the aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements as restated and this report does not affect our report dated february 10 2006 except as to the restatement discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements which is as of january 19 2007 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements 

 

in our opinion management’s restated assessment that ge did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria ge did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by coso

the worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and mro including parts sales is intense both us and export markets are important product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success research and development expenditures both customerfinanced and internally funded are important in this business as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design manufacture repair and product upgrade technologies 

 

potential sales for any engine are limited by among other things its technological lifetime which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in technology the small number of potential customers and the limited number of relevant airframe applications aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and airline procurement cycles although these cycles differ from each other

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this report 

 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate discussion about the important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the mda section of our 2005 annual report to shareowners and in the business descriptions in item 1 of this form 10k below we have described our present view of certain important strategic risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will determine our future results 

 

our global growth is subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

 

we conduct our operations in virtually every part of the world global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways operations are subject to the effects of global competition particular local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws and from local liquidity regulations including risks of not being able to retrieve assets our global business is affected by local economic environments including inflation recession and currency volatility political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain our customers and all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful 

 

our credit ratings are important to our cost of capital 

 

the major debt agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given their highest debt ratings to us one of our strategic objectives is to maintain these “triple a” ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders failure to maintain our triple a debt rating could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins 

 

the disposition of businesses that do not fit with our evolving strategy can be highly uncertain 

 

we will continue to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives our decisions to sell genworth and ge insurance solutions are recent examples of disposition decisions when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms which are less than we had anticipated in addition there is a risk that we sell a business whose subsequent performance exceeds our expectations in which case our decision would have potentially sacrificed enterprise value correspondingly we may be too optimistic about a particular business’s prospects in which case we may be unable to find a buyer at a price acceptable to us and therefore may have potentially sacrificed enterprise value

the worldwide competition in aircraft jet engines and mro including parts sales is intense both us and export markets are important product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success research and development expenditures both customerfinanced and internally funded are important in this segment focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design manufacture repair and product upgrade technologies are also important 

potential sales for any engine are limited by among other things its technological lifetime which may vary considerably depending upon the rate of advance in the state of the art by the small number of potential customers and by the limited number of relevant airframe applications aircraft engine orders tend to follow military and commercial airline procurement cycles although cycles for military and commercial engine procurement are different procurements of military jet engines are affected by changes in global political and economic factors

in line with industry practice airframe manufacturers support their sales of commercial jet aircraft from time to time with longterm financing commitments to customers and engine manufacturers are often asked to participate in such financings in making such commitments it is our policy to establish a secured position in the aircraft being financed under such airline financing programs we had issued guarantees amounting to 04 billion at yearend 2003 and had entered into commitments totaling 12 billion to provide financial assistance on future sales of aircraft equipped with our engines our guarantees and commitments are secured by individual aircraft or pools of aircraft engines related to the specific financing arrangement when particular guarantees exceed the value of the associated security we consider credit risk of the customer and provide for estimated losses at december 31 2003 the total estimated fair value of aircraft securing these guarantees exceeded the guaranteed amounts net of the associated allowance for losses see page 49 of the 2003 annual report to shareowners for information about orders and backlog

consolidation in the financial services industry will create fewer but larger competitors we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features price commission structure marketing and distribution arrangements brand reputation financial strength ratings and service we believe that we are well positioned in the current competitive environment and will benefit from a number of significant demographic governmental and market trends including an aging united states population with growing retirement income needs and an increasing life and lifestyle protection gap

many of our activities are regulated by a variety of insurance and other regulators 

mortgage insurance

mortgage insurance offers mortgage insurance products that facilitate homeownership by enabling borrowers to buy homes with lowdownpayment mortgages these products also aid financial institutions in managing their capital efficiently by reducing the capital required for lowdownpayment mortgages we also have leading mortgage insurance operations in canada australia and the uk and a growing presence in continental europe 

the mortgage insurance industry is sensitive to the interest rate environment and housing market conditions the mortgage insurance industry is intensely competitive as excess market capacity seeks to underwrite business being generated from a consolidating customer base in addition considerable influence is exerted on the industry by two governmentsponsored enterprises which buy the majority of the loans insured by mortgage insurers

during 2003 general electric mortgage insurance corporation gemico requested that its financial strength ratings be lowered from aaaaaa to aaaa2 positioning our united states business to operate at lower capital levels this change improves mortgage insurances capital efficiency and return on equity while retaining a conservative risktocapital ratio 

ge global insurance holding employers reinsurance corporation 

through our principal insurance and reinsurance company affiliates – employers reinsurance corporation ge reinsurance corporation the ge frankona group and the medical protective corporation – we write substantially all lines of reinsurance where the insured party is another insurance company and select lines of direct property and casualty insurance where the insured party is a noninsurance company or an individual

11

 

the reinsurance operations include the reinsurance of property and casualty risks written by more than 1000 insurers around the world direct insurance operations are focused on niche lines of business principally medical malpractice coverage for physicians and dentists medical professional liability for hospitals errors and omissions coverage for insurance agents and brokers professional liability insurance for attorneys excess indemnity for selfinsurers of medical benefits and excess workers compensation for selfinsurers the life reinsurance affiliates are engaged in the reinsurance of life insurance products including term whole and universal life annuities certain healthrelated coverages and the provision of financial reinsurance to life insurers during 2003 we announced our intent to scale back on life reinsurance operations to improve overall returns we ceased writing new life reinsurance business in the united states and sold our united states life reinsurance business–erc life reinsurance corporation

in our opinion we compete in the reinsurance marketplace principally on the basis of our expertise relationships financial strength price and creativity in developing customized solutions to customer needs within the direct insurance marketplace we believe we compete principally on the basis of our product offerings established relationships with customers and key distribution partners price and ease of doing business

employers reinsurance corporation is one of the largest competitors in its marketplace our property and casualty reinsurance operations are ranked fifth in the world in terms of net premiums written and we compete with the worlds largest reinsurers as well as dozens of smaller niche competitors our life reinsurance operations are ranked in the top four life reinsurers in the world 

maintaining strong financial strength ratings is an important factor in remaining competitive in both the reinsurance and direct insurance markets in which we compete during 2003 certain external credit rating agencies announced the lowering of financial strength ratings with respect to ge global insurance holding and subsidiaries citing poor recent operating performance as the principal factor rating agencies took similar actions to lower the ratings of many insurers and reinsurers in recent years debt ratings for ge global insurance holding affect 17 billion of outstanding debt while these ratings were lowered in 2003 they remain investment grade we do not believe these actions will materially affect ge global insurance holding liquidity or capital resources or the ability to write future business
