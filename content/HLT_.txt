the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry since the beginning of 2020 the pervasiveness and severity of resulting travel restrictions and stayathome directives which have varied by country and state and fluctuated based on a number of factors resulted in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world particularly during 2020 this resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many areas where our hotels are located throughout 2020 and during parts of 2021 as of december 31 2021 however nearly all of our hotels that had suspended operations for some period of time as a result of the pandemic were open further during 2021 the distribution of covid19 vaccinations and overall easing of travel and other restrictions generated a renewed interest in travel and tourism activities around the globe although the economic recovery from 2020 began in 2021 the covid19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our results for both the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and we cannot predict when our performance and results of operations will return to the levels that we experienced prior to the onset of the pandemic

fee which is generally based on a percentage of the hotels operating profits normally over a oneyear calendar period and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and the appointment of certain key personnel additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotels sales or usage as reimbursement for the costs related to our i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance programs owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2021 we managed 745 hotels with 234640 rooms which does not include hotels in our ownership segment

some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have an optional cure right to pay an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited

ownership 

as a hotel owner and lessee we focus on maximizing cost efficiency and profitability of the owned and leased portfolio by among other things maximizing hotel revenues implementing costeffective labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to hotel and asset management we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their competitive position and at many of our hotels we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability as of december 31 2021

in alignment with our sciencebased targets we continue to take steps to increase our sourcing of renewable energy at our hotels around the world in the emea region onethird of the hotels we operate including owned leased and managed hotels as well as our watford and glasgow offices were supplied with 100 percent renewable energy during the year ended december 31 2021 and in the us we continued to have a renewable energy option for our managed hotels further we continued our focus on our food waste reduction and food donation initiatives with all of our managed hotels in the us and canada required to have food donation programs in place we also operate the industry’s largest soap recycling program with over 5500 of our hotels partnered with soap recycling organizations to donate new soap bars and other unused supplies from our hotels to those in need consistent with our effort to reduce waste further in 2021 we began to shift our hotels to bulk bath amenities in an effort to reduce plastic waste hotels have already begun switching to bulk products with compliance required at all hotels by 2023 we also continue to work with our environmental partner the world wildlife fund to evolve our environmental strategy and implement our programs globally 

our primary source of carbon emissions is from the operation of our hotels in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we experienced a significant decrease in utility consumption across our global portfolio primarily as a result of reduced occupancy and the complete or partial suspensions of hotel operations during 2021 we began to recover from the 

negative impacts of the pandemic and while some hotels were suspended for some period of time during the year the majority of hotels that had suspended operations for some time during 2020 were reopened before or during 2021 as such we experienced a yearoveryear increase in consumption of energy water and waste in 2021 as occupancy rates increased however consumption remained below 2019 levels and we remain on track to achieve our 2030 goals as we implement ongoing efforts to optimize efficiency at our hotels we are making significant efforts to support our hotels to keep consumption below prepandemic levels 

we have achieved the following reductions in environmental impact since 2008

as a core underpinning of our entire organization our ethics and compliance program is overseen by our board of directors which expects all hilton employees to conduct themselves to a high standard our code of conduct establishes a set of global business principles with our compliance organization training risk management and monitoring activities tailored to address unique risks by geography business line function and level our code of conduct is supported by a robust set of compliance policies addressing risk areas such as corruption trade sanctions insider trading privacy confidential information antitrust and escalation of concerns our legal and compliance training program which is an annual requirement for all of our employees provides the ability to convey a consistent set of compliance standards across the organization in formats designed to target different knowledge levels learning styles and functional needs our annual training calendar includes mandatory training and supplemental training that is supported by companywide awareness campaigns highlighting hiltonspecific risks and scenarios we also use passive communication channels including electronic bulletin board screens in the employee break room areas of our hotels and internal newsletters including a publication that highlights real hilton compliance hotline matters and their resolutions

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager franchisor owner and lessee competition in the hospitality industry is based on several criteria generally including the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels inns and other accommodation rental services in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and lessee of hotels with an associated global systemwide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us continue to maintain our position as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are accor sa choice hotels international hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international radisson hotel group and wyndham hotels  resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel including personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities tend to be more fixed than variable as a result of such fixed costs in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues in 2020 we and our hotel owners experienced a downturn in the current industry cycle driven by the covid19 pandemic which continued into 2021 however the level of travel in 2021 recovered substantially when compared to that of 2020 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our ip which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employees minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain properties in puerto rico and egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

for additional information on government regulation including environmental regulations and requirements refer to part i—item 1a risk factors 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements generally us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of such hotel 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels and we maintain workers compensation or equivalent coverage for all of our employees we also are selfinsured for health coverage for some of our us employees which include those working at our corporate operations and managed hotels in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and advisories stayathome directives limitations on public gatherings and modified work arrangements all of which have resulted in cancellations and reduced travel around the world as well as complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations although distribution of approved vaccines for covid19 began in late 2020 and continued throughout 2021 access to and acceptance of vaccines has varied across regions and within individual countries in addition new strains of the virus have had increased transmissibility complicating treatment and vaccination programs as such the covid19 pandemic had a material negative impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2021 and will continue to negatively affect future results the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remain uncertain and will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and severity of increases in serious illnesses if any the availability and public acceptance of vaccinations and other treatments to combat covid19 and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume the current and uncertain future impact of the covid19 pandemic including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging food and beverage and other services is expected to continue to negatively affect our results operations outlook plans growth cash flows and liquidity 

during the pandemic the us and other national and local governments have imposed travel restrictions at various times and in some countries and us states reimposed such restrictions and a number of our hotels fully or partially suspended operations primarily during 2020 but also during 2021 we have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by additional governmental regulations and travel restrictions or advisories to fight the pandemic including recommendations by the us department of state the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization along with other governmental and health and safety authorities 

although nearly all of our hotels that completely or partially suspended operations at some point during 2020 and 2021 have fully reopened we cannot predict if any of our hotels will have to completely or partially suspend operations in the future moreover even where travel advisories and restrictions have been lifted travel demand has been weak for periods of time and we cannot predict if or when our hotels and resorts will return to prepandemic demand or pricing although we have implemented enhanced hygiene and cleaning standards and other protocols to protect our guests and employees we cannot fully predict their impact on public perception regarding travelrelated covid19 risks adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate including higher unemployment rates inflation declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also negatively affect travel demand conversely rapid increases in demand also could pose challenges due to labor shortages 

the steps we took in 2020 to reduce operating costs including temporarily reducing compensation reducing our workforce and furloughing a substantial number of our employees and further steps we may take in the future to reduce costs for us or our thirdparty hotel owners may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees some hotels have faced challenges restaffing to prepandemic levels which may negatively affect hotel results guest experience and loyalty we also may face demands or requests from labor unions that represent employees at our hotels for additional compensation healthcare benefits or other terms including making payments to underfunded multiemployer pension plans for covered union employees as a result of the pandemic that could increase costs and we could experience labor issues if we have to implement further mitigation plans even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could still experience longterm impacts on our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of covid19 or other viruses through for example enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions 

the covid19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our partners including thirdparty owners of our properties thirdparty service providers travel agencies suppliers and other vendors in particular thirdparty owners of our hotels have experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in revenues thereby making it more difficult for them to maintain their hotels and service their indebtedness this in turn makes it more likely that they could declare bankruptcy or face other difficulties with their lenders or other creditors bankruptcies sales or foreclosures involving our hotels could in some cases 

result in the termination of our management or franchise contracts and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows including amounts currently due to us under existing agreements which would negatively affect our results of operations hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on a timely basis or at all current and ongoing economic conditions also could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential thirdparty owners of our hotels who may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays or cost pressures in developing hotel projects as a result some properties in our development pipeline have entered our system later than we anticipated and new hotels may enter our pipeline at a slower rate than in the past thereby negatively affecting our overall growth likewise if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels the quality of our hotels may suffer which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty and our market share may suffer as a result 

we may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our prospects and our credit ratings certain of our credit ratings have been downgraded or placed on credit watch and if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our credit rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be negatively affected in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations there is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations in addition because of reduced travel demand certain of our leased properties have or may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses which may include rent due to the landlords of those properties if or when we determine the value of our leased properties or the carrying value of other assets has significantly declined we may recognize as we did in 2020 significant noncash impairment charges in our results of operations further to the extent the covid19 pandemic significantly impacts spending patterns of hilton honors cobranded credit cardholders or the acquisition of new cardholders we will receive lower license fees under our cobranded credit card arrangements 

the potential effects of the covid19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors described below including but not limited to risks inherent to the hospitality industry macroeconomic factors beyond our control such as challenges due to labor shortages and supply chain disruptions competition for hotel guests and management and franchise contracts risks related to doing business with thirdparty hotel owners performance of our information technology systems growth of reservation channels outside of our system risks of doing business outside of the us and risks related to our indebtedness because the covid19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving the other potential impacts to our other risk factors below are uncertain 

risks related to our industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

• significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world 

• the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners 

• relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture contracts 

• decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks 

• changes in operating costs including employee compensation and benefits energy insurance and food and beverage 

• increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by increases in revenues in our business as well as increases in overall prices and the prices of our offerings due to inflation which could weaken consumer demand for travel and the other products we offer and adversely affect our revenues 

• changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs 

• the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations 

• the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs 

• significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage 

• shortages of labor or labor disruptions 

• the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries who sell our hotel rooms to guests to attract and retain customers 

• the quality of services provided by franchisees including ability to comply with relevant requirements including environment human rights and labor 

• the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligations 

• delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects 

• cyclical overbuilding in the hospitality industry 

• changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development 

• changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services and 

• the costs required for climate change initiatives including those resulting from regulatory changes or stakeholder or customer expectations 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

• changes in general economic conditions including inflation supply chain disruptions low consumer confidence increases in unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy and financial markets 

• conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel or result in temporary closures or other disruption at our hotel properties including travelrelated accidents outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as covid19 ebola zika avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1n1 swine flu and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 

• geopolitical activity political and social unrest and governmental action and uncertainty resulting from us and global political and social trends and policies including potential barriers to travel trade and immigration 

• war political instability or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and resulting heightened travel security measures any of which may foreclose travel to certain locales or decrease the appeal of travel among the general population 

• decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions 

• statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities 

• the financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes and increased travel costs 

• perceived negative impacts of tourism on local cultures human rights and the environment 

• cyberattacks 

• the impact of climate change or availability of natural resources 

• natural climaterelated or manmade disasters and extreme weather conditions including earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes typhoons floods wildfires volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents 

• labor shortages which could restrict our ability to efficiently operate or grow our business andor increase our costs 

• organized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics and 

• other changes in the overall demand for what we offer including the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location and may change with changes in overall availability of lodging and hospitality options within a local market based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters and this was the case in 2021 as our recovery from the effects of the covid19 pandemic progressed through the year as vaccines and treatments became more widely available in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to operating our business 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests 

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location rates for hotel rooms food and beverage and other services property size and availability of rooms and conference and meeting space accommodations and technology quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise contracts 

we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our access to and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services andor using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited we may not be able to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices perceptions of our esg practices perception of guest or employee health or safety the occurrence of accidents or injuries cyberattacks security breaches natural disasters crime failure of suppliers franchisees or business partners to comply with relevant requirements including environmental human rights and labor requirements individual guest owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content a negative incident at one hotel could have farreaching effects including lost sales customer boycotts loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties such an incident also could subject us to legal actions including litigation governmental investigations or penalties along with the resulting additional adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to i establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and ii enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hospitality industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends in the industry more broadly could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts costs and availability of construction labor and materials and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property while we maintain certain contractual protections repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the operation maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands hiltons reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise contracts as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition use of technology safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards or based on customer demand more broadly guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any individually terminated hotels or broader thirdparty owner relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses or termination of existing management or franchise contracts 

our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2021 we had 2668 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline in particular for hotels not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

since 2011 we have launched nine new brands home2 suites by hilton curio collection by hilton canopy by hilton tru by hilton tapestry collection by hilton motto by hilton lxr hotels  resorts signia by hilton and most recently tempo by hilton we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the us over the past several years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

our investments in owned and leased real property including through joint ventures subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

• governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws 

  

• fluctuations or loss in value of real estate or potential impairments in the value of our assets such as that which occurred in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic due to changes in market conditions in the area in which real estate or assets are located 

• increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties 

• the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties some of which were constructed many years ago and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term 

• construction delays lack of availability of required construction materials or cost overruns including labor and materials related to necessary capital improvements of owned and leased properties 

• periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements 

• risks associated with any mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing 

• the inability to rebuild a property that has been damaged or destroyed by casualty including a climaterelated weather event as a result of governmental regulations 

• the inability to renew our leases on favorable terms or at all 

• our limited ability to influence the decisions and operations of joint ventures in which we have a minority interest 

• force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes wildfires floods tsunamis climaterelated weather events outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or acts of terrorism 

• contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property 

• costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property and 

• the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned and leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of the costs required to own and operate a hotel further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties or exit leasing arrangements on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites including as a result of cyberattacks on our systems or systems operated by third parties that provide operational and technical services to us costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we develop own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management procurement finance human resources reservations distribution and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses thirdparty criminal activity including ransomware or other malware and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location and cloud backup processes to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems our data center operations are currently located in a single facility or with a single cloudbased provider although we continue to renovate and migrate portions of our operations to cloudbased providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary physical or cloudbased facilities could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site or cloud providers damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our loyalty platform and reservation and distribution system rely on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties and cloud providers the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems and applications so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures unexpected costs and changes and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer malware changes in applicable federal state and international regulations security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and our thirdparty service providers experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time and despite our deployment of cyberattack prevention and detection techniques we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents we have in the past been subject to cyberattacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and as a result of this loss in confidence choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation fines regulatory charges and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including costs related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as risks associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information many jurisdictions including the european union eu california and nevada have passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the handling of personal data we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition us states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our guest loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner in some cases hotel owners may refuse to upgrade systems or deploy new technology to replace aging or endoflife software andor hardware as a result our business operations could be disrupted and our competitive position could decline adversely affecting our financial performance or we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our guests employees or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of confidential or otherwise sensitive data which could negatively impact our operations unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on the internal processes and controls of thirdparty software and application vendors to maintain the security of all software code provided to or used by hilton should those vendors fail to follow security best practices to secure their products then we are at risk of unintentionally injecting malware into our systems via compromised software code they provide the occurrence of any of the foregoing could negatively affect our reputation our competitive position and our financial performance and we could face lawsuits and potential liability 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of various goods or services that we use in the operation of our business the inability of such third parties to satisfy our or our guests requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised hotels in many cases we could be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as thirdparty alliances may require us to issue additional shares of stock incur debt assume liabilities or incur additional expenses in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations if we divest properties or assets such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this 

occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase these hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce bookings at our hotel properties by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected over time as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites which increases costs to hotels in our system internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business if that growth continues it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any disruption to the continuity of our reservation system including any failure to maintain or upgrade such system may adversely affect our ability to serve customers effectively and support reservations at our hotels 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors guest loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for all of the brands that we operate program members accumulate points primarily based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise contracts contribute a percentage of the charges incurred by members of the loyalty program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotel stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with third parties such as airlines other transportation services online vendors retailers and credit card companies to sell hilton honors points for the use of their customers andor to allow hilton honors members to use or exchange points for products or services made available to loyalty program members by those third parties currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the us the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 122 countries and territories around the world our rooms outside the us represented approximately 30 percent 28 percent and 28 percent of our systemwide rooms for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the us including 

• rapid changes in governmental economic or political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

• increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of our licensed brands as an american brand 

• recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate 

• the effect of disruptions including the temporary closure of hotel properties caused by severe weather or climaterelated events natural disasters including as a result of climate change outbreak of disease such as covid19 or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult 

• the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws 

•   

• the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with developing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments with respect to human rights including in the supply chain 

• instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change 

• political economic and other uncertainty resulting from the uks exit from the eu commonly known as brexit the terms of which could adversely affect our business 

• uncertainties as to local laws regarding and enforcement of contract and ip rights 

• forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and 

• the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from our hotels and resorts as well as the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and 

regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to a number of modern slavery human trafficking and forced labor reporting training and due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the future the impact of laws such as the uks modern slavery act 2015 australias modern slavery bill 2018 and similar legislation on hotel operations as well as supply chain could increase costs of operations and reduce profits 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 30 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements are in the process of being renegotiated and if more employees become unionized we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to influence the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the labor market for employers labor shortages have affected the ability of our hotels to hire or rehire employees during the ongoing recovery from the downturn caused by the pandemic among the factors causing the labor shortages are the relative reduced appeal of working in the hospitality industry in a downturn alternatives available in other industries and perceived health and safety concerns we employ or manage approximately 142000 individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to staff and operate the hotels that we manage own and lease could be diminished which could reduce customer satisfaction and our ability to manage our corporate business could be adversely affected in addition 

the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our owned leased and managed hotels as well as our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of thirdparty owners additionally an increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees which could in turn lower demand from thirdparty owners to add hotels to our system we also face challenges with respect to retaining corporate employees if we lost the services of one or more senior executives this could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other ip could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have a significant number of trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other ip however those trademark or other ip registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other ip in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other ip without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in those jurisdictions third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important ip rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our ip is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other ip are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our ip rights litigation of this type could be unsuccessful costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our ip in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our ip in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other ip could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain ip from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this ip our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe ip rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other ip rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

• be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages 

• force us to stop using the ip that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged ip 

• force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services 

• require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other contracts to obtain the right to use a third party’s ip 

• limit our ability to develop new ip and 

• limit the use or the scope of our ip or other rights 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty ip claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses that affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar usd subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of usd required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the usd received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the usd are reported in local currency and then translated to usd for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the usd will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions however these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements interest rate differentials and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise own or lease our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climaterelated disaster or other catastrophic losses exists and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry andor we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable firstparty and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control such as the natural climaterelated and manmade disasters and infectious diseases that occurred in 2021 could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates we anticipate increased costs of property general liability and excess liability insurance across the portfolio in 2022 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2021 and prior periods in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property additionally certain types of losses may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive to insure in addition other types of losses or risks that we may face could fall outside of the general coverage terms and limits of our policies the us terrorism risk insurance program the program provides insurance capacity for terrorist acts and is currently authorized through december 31 2027 if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we or owners of hotels that we manage or franchise could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

legal and regulatory risks 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements these requirements are complex and subject to frequent revision with changes at the us federal level often accompanying new us presidential administrations we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the construction continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to 

meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for instance in 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada although the bulk of our obligations under this settlement expired in 2015 certain managed and franchised hotels remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with any of the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm guest advocacy group or employee lawsuits and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 through december 31 2018 are actively under audit by the internal revenue service irs the irs has previously proposed material increases to our income tax liability related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program through the tax year ended december 31 2013 which we tentatively settled during 2021 the taxation of the hilton honors program continues to be subject to audit we may in the future be assessed tax on issues similar to those which were resolved during 2021 and the amounts of any such future assessments may be material an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including obtaining and maintaining any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs to comply with such requirements may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those intended to lessen the impact of climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties and landlords at leased properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years we and other hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type 

which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our spinoffs 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a tax matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2021 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 89 billion and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt for the years ending december 31 2022 2023 and 2024 are 54 million 26 million and 26 million respectively our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of existing debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

in addition certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses london interbank offer rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with liborbased interest rate derivatives on march 5 2021 the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative a immediately after december 31 2021 in the case of the one week and two month usd settings and b immediately after june 30 2023 in the case of the remaining usd settings the us federal reserve the federal reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate while all of our material financing arrangements indexed to libor provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued there can be no assurances as to whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than libor the federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rate committee a committee convened by the federal reserve that includes major market participants has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities as its preferred alternative rate for libor at this time it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the libor benchmarks is anticipated in coming years we intend to monitor developments with respect to the phasing out of libor and will work to minimize the impact of any libor transition the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital 

and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock 

• pay dividends including our subsidiaries paying dividends to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• make certain investments 

• incur certain liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• merge or consolidate 

• enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us 

• designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and 

• transfer or sell assets 

in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 50 to 10 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay future dividends if any to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

because we suspended our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock during 2020 you may not receive any return on your investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we suspended payment of our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock in 2020 and have not yet reinstated it our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that one might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

• although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

• these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office 

• these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote and 

• these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry since the beginning of 2020 our asia pacific region began experiencing the effects of the covid19 pandemic in january 2020 while the pronounced negative results and suspensions of hotel operations in the americas and europe middle east and africa emea regions did not begin until midmarch 2020 since the beginning of the pandemic the pervasiveness and severity of travel restrictions and stayathome directives have varied by country and state and fluctuated based on a number of factors including i covid19 infection surges and contractions ii the emergence of new strains and variants of the virus and iii the distribution of covid19 vaccinations which commenced in late 2020 the pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 when compared to periods prior to the onset of the pandemic and although all periods were significantly impacted by the pandemic none of these periods are considered comparable and no periods affected by the pandemic are expected to be comparable to future periods although we have observed signs of economic recovery we cannot determine when the global economy will fully recover accordingly given the ongoing nature of the pandemic the ultimate impact that it will have on the companys business financial performance and results of operations remains uncertain 

although certain restrictions have been reinstated with the spread of new variants of the virus the broader distribution of covid19 vaccinations beginning in early 2021 and the overall easing of travel and other restrictions generated renewed interest in travel and tourism activities in many markets around the globe in 2021 however the continued spreading of covid19 and its related variants could result in travel and other restrictions being implemented or reinstated in the affected areas where our hotels may be located in future periods yielding further negative effects on our operations 

while the restrictions and the reduction in travel resulted in the suspensions of operations at certain hotels throughout 2020 reopenings significantly outpaced new suspensions and resuspensions during 2021 with approximately 360 hotels suspended for some period of time during the year ended december 31 2021 nearly all of the hotels that suspended operations at some point since the start of the pandemic had reopened as of december 31 2021

segments and regions 

we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products or services i management and franchise and ii ownership the management and franchise segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our ip this segment generates its revenue from i management and franchise fees charged to thirdparty hotel owners ii licensing fees from hgv and strategic partnerships including cobranded credit card arrangements for the right to use our ip and iii fees for managing hotels in our ownership segment as a manager of hotels we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in 

exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing nightly hotel room sales food and beverage sales and other services at our consolidated owned and leased hotels 

geographically we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions i the americas ii emea and iii asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us which represented 70 percent of our systemwide hotel rooms as of december 31 2021 is included in the americas region it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately and as such are presented separately within the analysis herein the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

system growth and development pipeline 

our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global portfolio and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our ip prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on its geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners over time we expect to increase revenues overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs while these objectives have not changed as a result of the covid19 pandemic the current economic environment has posed certain challenges to the execution of our strategy which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development see further discussion on our cash management policy as detailed in —liquidity and capital resources 

we are focused on the growth of our business by expanding our share of the global hospitality industry through our development pipeline which includes hotels that we expect to add to our system in the future the following table summarizes our development activity 



 

1 rounded to the nearest hundred 

2 represents net unit growth for the year ended december 31 2021 of 56 percent 

3 hotels in our system are under development throughout 115 countries and territories including 28 countries and territories where we do not currently have any existing hotels 

4 in our development pipeline as of december 31 2021 198000 of the rooms were under construction and 249600 of the rooms were located outside of the us nearly all of the rooms in our development pipeline are within our management and franchise segment we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

brexit 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit in december 2020 the uk and the eu reached a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing their future relationship the euuk trade and cooperation agreement which was fully implemented from may 1 2021 while the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provides clarity in respect of the intended future relationship between the uk and the eu and some detailed matters of trade and cooperation it remains unclear what general longterm economic financial 

trade and legal implications the uk withdrawal from the eu will have and how it will ultimately affect our business while our results as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 were not materially affected by brexit specifically we will continue to monitor the potential impact of brexit on our business in future periods 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

• franchise and licensing fees  represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands as well as fees from licensing agreements to use our ip under our longterm franchise contracts with hotel owners franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include i monthly royalty fees generally based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues as applicable and ii application initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees our nonhotel licensing agreements are predominantly with hgv and strategic partners including cobranded credit card providers 

• base and incentive management fees represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross revenue and when applicable an incentive fee which is typically based on the hotels operating profits normally over a onecalendar year period and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the hotel owner outside of the us our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive fee or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees 

• owned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from the operations of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including hotel room sales accommodations sold in conjunction with other services food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions which may be sponsored by corporate social military educational religious or other organizations or associations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as meetings facilities and catering and banquet services a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues 

• other revenues represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels including our purchasing operations and other operating income 

• other revenues from managed and franchised properties represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through program fees billed and collected in advance related to certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties the direct reimbursements by property owners are for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally our responsibility and certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income loss or net income loss the monthly program fee that is paid by hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels that we manage is based on the underlying hotels sales or usage and relates to the costs of our brands and shared services including i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance programs other revenues from managed and franchised properties also includes revenues related to our hilton honors guest loyalty program which are primarily derived from payments from hotel franchisees and third 

party owners of hotels we manage that participate in the program as well as cobranded credit card providers we are contractually required to use these fees that we collect solely for these programs 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

• consumer demand and global economic conditions  consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels among other factors declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks reducing or otherwise negatively affecting travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can reduce the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate andor reduce the revenues and profitability of the operations of our owned and leased hotels further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers of our hotels as a result of the covid19 pandemic several of these factors as well as health and safety concerns had a significant effect on global economic conditions and consumer demand for our products and services also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profitability measures as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected are currently subjecting and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility 

• contracts with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers  we depend on our longterm management and franchise contracts with thirdparty hotel owners and hotel franchisees for our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties allow us to maintain our current presence as contracts mature and also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

• owned and leased hotels reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expenses food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expenses include compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory other support expenses include costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas operating telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and other services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurance 

• depreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of i amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of blackstone inc the merger which primarily include values assigned to management and franchise contracts leases and our hilton honors guest loyalty program intangible asset ii amortization of capitalized software costs and iii depreciation and amortization of property and equipment including our finance lease rightofuse rou assets such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

• fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows margins and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth including that which resulted from the covid19 pandemic economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands additionally the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs however we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions while continuing to optimize value for the experiences of our customers owners and hilton employees supporting the longterm sustainability of our brands and business 

• changes in depreciation and amortization expenses we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expenses will increase as the finitelived intangible assets that were recorded at the merger become fully amortized amortization expenses will decrease additionally changes in depreciation expenses may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels or corporate facilities through sale closure or lease termination lease renewals expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expenses on those assets if we are required to recognize impairment losses related to our depreciable assets or finitelived intangible assets the related depreciation or amortization expenses respectively will decrease 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is usd and we have assets and liabilities including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate the results of those operations assets and liabilities from their functional currency into usd at marketbased foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods we hedge foreign currency exchangebased cash flow variability of certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments we also hold shortterm forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances primarily related to our intercompany financing arrangements and we have not currently elected to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results were not available of the 6777 hotels in our system as of december 31 2021 5524 hotels were classified as comparable hotels our 1253 noncomparable hotels included 70 hotels or approximately one percent of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were otherwise not available 

when considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels no hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any time as a result of the covid19 pandemic was excluded from the definition of comparable hotels on that basis alone despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations we believe that including these hotels within our hotel operating statistics of occupancy average daily rate adr and revenue per available room revpar if they would have otherwise been included reflects the underlying results of our business for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period adr measures the average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revpar 

revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels as previously described occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to occupancy adr and revpar are presented on a comparable basis based on the comparable hotels as of december 31 2021 and references to adr and revpar are presented on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted as such comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 or 2019 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the companys foreign operations within its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda reflects net income loss excluding interest expense a provision for income tax benefit expense and depreciation and amortization expenses adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain items including gains losses revenues and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructurings and retirements iv furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements v sharebased compensation vi reorganization severance relocation and other expenses vii noncash impairment viii amortization of contract acquisition costs ix the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties and x other items 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics including among other things capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization expenses as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i ffe replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment where payments for such capitalized assets are depreciated over their useful lives ii sharebased compensation as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them iii the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts and iv other items such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our operating performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as alternatives either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity including cash flows derived in accordance with gaap further ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools including 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and 

• other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 

results of operations 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



during the year ended december 31 2021 while the covid19 pandemic continued to negatively impact our business and our hotel operating statistics we experienced significant improvement in our results as compared to the prior year due to an upward trend in travel and tourism with the easing of many covid19 restrictions and the distribution of covid19 vaccinations all regions showed improvement in revpar during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the us experienced relatively consistent recovery throughout 2021 with occupancy for the year down 138 percentage points from 2019 while the recoveries of the europe and americas excluding us regions were outpaced by other regions early in 2021 the easing of travel restrictions and in europe a more expansive vaccination program accelerated their recovery later in the year resulting in improvement in operating statistics consistent with systemwide results for the full year of all regions mea recovered the most during the year with regard to revpar when compared to 2019 in asia pacific a fluctuating recovery due to prolonged covid19 and travel restrictions in certain countries on both domestic and international travel resulted in a more modest increase in revpar for the year when compared to the other regions our systemwide revpar and adr for the year ended december 31 2021 were down 300 percent and 99 percent respectively compared to the same period in 2019 on a comparable and currency neutral basis 

further as a result of the pandemic certain hotels suspended operations at various times throughout 2020 but the majority of those hotels were reopened by the beginning of 2021 in line with our recovery although some hotels did suspend operations during the year ended december 31 2021 reopenings significantly outpaced suspensions as such the operations of only approximately 360 hotels primarily located in the us and europe were suspended for some period of time during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to approximately 1280 hotels during the year ended december 31 2020 nearly all of the hotels that suspended operations at some point since the start of the pandemic had reopened as of december 31 2021 additionally while most hotels including those that reopened following suspensions of their operations experienced significantly lower occupancy during 2020 and early 2021 as compared to periods prior to the onset of the pandemic system 

wide occupancy improved during 2021 and systemwide occupancy during the three months ended december 31 2021 increased 207 percentage points as compared to the same period in 2020 

the table below provides a reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

1 amounts for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 include costs recognized for certain legal settlements severance not related to the reorganization activities undertaken in response to the covid19 pandemic and other items the amount for the year ended december 31 2020 also includes losses related to the disposal of an investment and the settlement of a debt guarantee for a franchised hotel and a gain related to the reimbursement by a third party for taxes owed resulting from the sale of a hotel in a prior period 

revenues 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful 

the covid19 pandemic began to negatively affect our franchise and licensing fees and total management fees in march 2020 however during 2021 we experienced increases in fees recognized as compared to fees recognized during 2020 driven by an upward trend in travel and tourism resulting from increased desire to travel by our customers as covid19 vaccinations were distributed more broadly and covid19 restrictions eased in many areas additionally there were decreases in the number of hotels that had suspended operations as a result of the pandemic during the respective periods with approximately 1245 managed and franchised hotels with suspended operations for some period of time during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to approximately 345 managed and franchised hotels during the year ended december 31 2021 nearly all of the managed and franchised hotels that suspended operations at some point since the start of the pandemic were reopened as of december 31 2021 

for the year ended december 31 2021 revpar increased 623 percent at our comparable franchised properties and 552 percent at our comparable managed properties as a result of increased occupancy of 183 percentage points and 127 percentage points respectively and increased adr of 134 percent and 123 percent respectively 

including new development and ownership type transfers from january 1 2020 to december 31 2021 we added over 730 managed and franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 105000 rooms to our management and franchise segment as new hotels were part of our system for full periods and were part of the recovery from the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic such hotels increased our franchise and management fees during the periods and we expect this trend to continue in future periods 

additionally licensing and other fees increased 97 million during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to increases in licensing fees from our strategic partnerships and hgv which were the result of increased cobranded credit cardholder spend and timeshare revenues respectively both resulting from the rise in consumer spending and travel and tourism during the period 

incentive management fees increased during the period as they are based on hotels operating profits which have improved significantly from the prior year as a result of increased demand at our properties 



the increase in owned and leased hotel revenues during the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily attributable to the ongoing recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the resulting increase in occupancy across our owned and leased hotels although the operations of approximately 15 and 35 of our owned and leased hotels were suspended for some period of time during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively as a result of the covid19 pandemic all of these hotels were reopened before december 31 2021 

the increase in owned and leased hotel revenues during the year ended december 31 2021 included a 7 million increase as a result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and on a currency neutral basis a 130 million increase and 40 million increase from our comparable and noncomparable owned and leased hotels respectively the increase in revenues from our comparable owned and leased hotels was the result of increased revpar of 453 percent primarily due to increased occupancy of 95 percentage points and adr of 47 percent as well as a 27 million increase in covid19 relief subsidies from international governments that were recognized as revenues the increase in revenues from our noncomparable owned and leased hotels which included five leased hotels that exited our system or transferred to our management and franchise segment on december 31 2021 included a 10 million increase on a currency neutral basis in covid19 relief subsidies from international governments additionally the overall increase on a currency neutral basis of 40 million in revenues from our noncomparable owned and leased hotels was net of an 11 million decrease from properties that were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated in 2020 and mid2021 with most of these properties transferring to our management and franchise segment 



the increase in other revenues during the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily due to increased revenues from our purchasing operations related to improved hotel demand resulting from the rise in travel and tourism during 2021 

operating expenses 



the increase in owned and leased hotel expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 included a 19 million increase as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and on a currency neutral basis a 46 million 

increase and a 6 million decrease from our comparable and noncomparable owned and leased hotels respectively our owned and leased hotels had increases in certain operating expenses as a result of increased occupancy during 2021 including variable rent costs which are generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits partially offset by decreased expenses related to ffe replacement reserves due to timing of costs and spending on improvement projects incurred at our leased properties the decrease in expenses from our noncomparable owned and leased hotels which included five leased hotels that exited our system or transferred to our management and franchise segment on december 31 2021 also included a 16 million decrease on a currency neutral basis from properties that were sold or for which the lease agreements were terminated in 2020 and mid2021 with most of these properties transferring to our management and franchise segment 



the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses was due to a decrease in amortization expenses primarily resulting from the full amortization of i certain management and franchise contract intangible assets that were recorded at the time of the merger during 2020 and ii certain capitalized software costs during both periods 

the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation expense as a result of expenses recognized during the year ended december 31 2021 for all of the outstanding performance shares which were probable of achievement as of december 31 2021 sharebased compensation expense recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 included the reversal of expense recognized in prior years as a result of the determination that the performance conditions of our thenoutstanding performance shares were no longer probable of achievement partially offset by expense recorded in december 2020 as a result of the modification of our thenoutstanding performance shares see note 15 sharebased compensation in our consolidated financial statements for additional information also for the year ended december 31 2021 payroll expenses for our corporate workforce increased as furloughs and reduced pay in 2020 yielded lower comparable costs reflected in general and administrative expenses partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in bad debt expense which was in line with the improvement we experienced with respect to the timing and volume of payments from hotel owners throughout 2021 as compared to 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized reorganization costs related to activities undertaken in response to the covid19 pandemic primarily relating to reductions in our workforce and the associated costs 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 258 million of impairment losses primarily related to our ownership segment including 104 million on our ownership reporting units goodwill along with certain assets associated with specific owned and leased hotels additionally 15 million was on management contract acquisition costs as a result of actual and expected early terminations of the related management contracts 

other expenses decreased primarily as a result of expenses related to the settlement of a dispute with an owner of a managed hotel and expenses related to performance guarantees that were recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 

nonoperating income and expenses 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful 

the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2021 included the decrease resulting from the issuances of new senior unsecured notes and the use of such proceeds for the redemptions of existing senior unsecured notes in december 2020 and february 2021 which reduced the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding senior unsecured notes additionally we repaid the entire outstanding balance on the senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility by june 2021 while it was fully drawn for the period from march 2020 to december 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 our variable interest expense also decreased due to declines in the variable interest rate on our senior secured term loan facility the term loan these decreases in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2021 were partially offset by an increase due to the issuances of new senior unsecured notes in april 2020 see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and the associated interest rates 

the loss on foreign currency transactions during both the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations conducted in functional currencies other than our reported currency as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany financing arrangements including shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans additionally the loss recognized during the year ended december 31 2020 included losses related to the liquidation of investments in foreign entities that were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

loss on debt extinguishments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 related to the redemptions of senior notes and included redemption premiums of 55 million and 31 million respectively and the accelerated recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs of 14 million and 17 million respectively see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these redemptions 

other nonoperating income loss net consists of interest income equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates certain income and costs related to our defined employee benefit plans and other nonoperating gains and losses the change in other nonoperating income loss net during the year ended december 31 2021 included an 8 million increase related to our employee benefit plans primarily as a result of a decrease in interest cost and an increase in the expected investment gains from our plan assets the year ended december 31 2020 included other nonoperating losses related to a debt guarantee for a franchised hotel and the disposal of an investment offset by a gain related to the reimbursement by a third party for taxes owed resulting from the sale of a hotel in a prior period

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2021 we had total cash and cash equivalents of 1512 million including 85 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents is related to cash collateral and cash held for ffe reserves 

in response to the global crisis resulting from the covid19 pandemic we took certain proactive measures in 2020 to help our business withstand the negative impact on our business from the crisis these measures included securing our liquidity position to be able to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future including issuing senior notes drawing down the available borrowing capacity of our 175 billion revolving credit facility and consummating the april 2020 presale of hilton honors points to american express for 10 billion in cash the honors points presale further in february 2021 we issued the 3625 senior notes due 2032 to continue to extend debt maturities and reduce our cost of debt by repaying the outstanding 5125 senior notes due 2026 based on our continued recovery and expectations of the foreseeable demands on our available cash and our liquidity in future periods we had fully repaid the outstanding debt balance on the revolving credit facility by june 2021 

while our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2021 is somewhat less than periods prior to the start of the pandemic we are generally experiencing slower payment of certain fees due to us and we have considered these payment trends in developing our estimates of expected future credit losses however during the year ended december 31 2021 we experienced relative improvement with respect to the timing of customer payments and overall cash flow from operations when compared to 2020 

our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures including 

• costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels 

• costs other than compensation and rent as noted separately below associated with the operations of owned and leased hotels including but not limited to utilities and operating supplies 

• corporate expenses 

• payroll and compensation costs 

• taxes and compliance costs 

• scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness which excluding finance lease liabilities are estimated to be approximately 316 million in 2022 

• lease payments under our finance and operating leases which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to be approximately 61 million and 177 million respectively in 2022 

• committed contract acquisition costs and 

• capital expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment 

our known longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for 

• scheduled debt maturities and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness which excluding finance lease liabilities are estimated to total an aggregate of 105 billion after december 31 2022 

• lease payments under our finance and operating leases which include minimum lease payments that are estimated to total an aggregate of 194 million and 1081 million respectively after december 31 2022 

• committed contract acquisition costs 

• capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment 

• corporate capital and information technology expenditures and 

• commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment made in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by these owners through program fees to operate our marketing sales and brands programs 

additionally in circumstances where we have the opportunity to support our strategic objectives by growing our global footprint we may provide performance or debt guarantees or loan commitments as necessary for hotels that we currently or plan to manage or franchise as applicable as well as letters of credit that support hotel financing or other obligations of hotel owners see note 19 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these commitments that were outstanding as of december 31 2021 

we formally suspended share repurchases in march 2020 given the economic environment and our efforts to preserve cash and no share repurchases have been made since then however the stock repurchase program remains authorized by our board of directors with approximately 22 billion remaining available for share repurchases under the program and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending on market conditions our capital needs and other factors additionally we suspended dividend payments in 2020 but we expect that both share repurchases and dividend payments will be reinstated in future periods and result in uses of liquidity 

although the covid19 pandemic has caused us to temporarily change our cash management strategy we have a longterm investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases which we expect to reimplement at some time in the future within the framework of our investment policy we currently intend to continue to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of december 31 2021 cash generated from our operations and as needed the use of the available capacity of our revolving credit facility additionally we have continued access to debt markets and expect to be able to obtain financing if necessary 

after considering our approach to liquidity and our available sources of cash we believe that our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and other compensation costs taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity while minimizing operational costs 

we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt andor purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings open market transactions privately negotiated transactions or otherwise issuances or incurrence of new debt or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt andor purchases or retirements of outstanding debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our net cash flows 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful see additional details below 

operating activities 

as we recover from the negative impacts of the pandemic and our systemwide revpar increases we are returning to a position where cash flows are being generated from our operations 

the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily attributable to the 10 billion of cash received in connection with the honors points presale during 2020 excluding the impact of this transaction cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to the increase in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise segment largely as a result of an increase in managed and franchised revpar of 608 percent due to the recovery from the covid19 pandemic as well as the decrease in cash paid for interest of 74 million primarily as a result of the senior notes issuances and redemptions in december 2020 and february 2021 see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information this increase was partially offset by a 150 million increase in payments of contract acquisition costs which reflects our strategic investment in growing our system by adding hotels to our management and franchise segment as well as an increase in cash paid for income taxes of 102 million primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities primarily related to capitalized software costs that were related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations and to capital expenditures for property and equipment related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of certain hotels in our ownership segment beginning in march 2020 we took steps to temporarily reduce such expenditures in response to the covid19 pandemic and continued to limit investment spending throughout 2021 however we expect such costs to continue to increase in future periods aligned to our recovery from the pandemic 

financing activities 

the change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to our revolving credit facility which we fully drew down during the year ended december 31 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic resulting in net cash inflows of 15 billion while we fully repaid the 17 billion outstanding debt balance during the year ended december 31 2021 additionally during the year ended december 31 2020 we had a net additional 10 billion of senior notes borrowings as compared to the year ended december 31 2021 further cash outflows decreased 338 million in 2021 as a result of decreases in share repurchases and dividend payments as both programs remained suspended after their suspension was initiated in 2020 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2021 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 89 billion and we had letters of credit of 60 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility for additional information on our total indebtedness including financing transactions executed during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 availability under our revolving credit facility and guarantees on our debt refer to note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our cash flows from operations as compared to periods prior to the onset of the pandemic and is expected to continue to do so for an indeterminate period of time however during the year ended december 31 2021 we returned to a position where we were generating cash flows from our core operations during 2020 we took precautions to secure our cash position as discussed above and with our business recovering during 2021 we were able to repay outstanding debt borrowings on our revolving credit facility and we expect to be able to meet our current obligations furthermore we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to may 2025

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

we believe that the following estimates which are used in conjunction with our significant accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and are based on information that is inherently uncertain refer to note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for information on our significant accounting policies management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

impairment of goodwill and brands intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 18 business segments in our consolidated financial statements 

as part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment we exercise judgment to 

• perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy regional performance and expectations and historical experience 

• decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment factors we consider when making this determination include changes in the company or general economic conditions since the previous quantitative assessment was performed the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at that time and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment and 

• perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment loss the estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units and brands 

changes in our estimates and assumptions or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect them such as those described above that were used in our impairment testing could result in impairment losses which could be material 

impairment of certain finitelived assets 

we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets operating and finance lease rou assets and property and equipment for indicators of impairment and if such indicators exist we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the determined asset group by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the asset group 

as part of the process we exercise judgment to 

• determine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy regional performance and expectations historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific information 

• determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated performance over the expected useful life of the asset group forwardlooking estimates of future performance are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources and 

• determine the asset group fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available for a specific asset group current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate applied to forwardlooking projections takes into account marketspecific considerations 

changes in our estimates and assumptions or changes in the factors that we consider that would affect them such as those described above that were used in our impairment testing could result in impairment losses which could be material 

hilton honors 

we record a point redemption liability for amounts received from properties participating in our hilton honors guest loyalty program and strategic partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage thirdparty actuaries annually to assist in determining the fair value of the future reward redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of points that will eventually be redeemed which includes an estimate of breakage ie points that will never be redeemed and the cost of reimbursing properties and other third parties the cost of the points expected to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any changes to the program including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward any amounts received from strategic partners related to the issuance of points that are in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue upon point redemption we recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point inclusive of estimated breakage and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs 

in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program we earn fees from strategic partnerships including cobranded credit card arrangements for the use of our ip license and the issuance of hilton honors points the allocation of the overall fees from the strategic partnerships between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relieffromroyalty valuation method incorporating statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment including estimates of credit card usage an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the projected cash flows the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the strategic partnerships is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above adjusted for an appropriate margin 

due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and the extension of our temporary suspension of the expiration of hilton honors points through december 31 2022 we reassessed the expected redemption rate of our hilton honors points as a result we adjusted our estimates of breakage to include among other factors the anticipated point expirations that will occur on december 31 2022 

changes in our estimates and assumptions that are used to determine our estimated cost per point could result in material changes in the balances of our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in estimates and assumptions that are used to determine the allocation of the fees from strategic partnerships between the ip license fee and the hilton honors points and revenue recognized on point redemptions could result in material changes to our licensing fees and other revenues from managed and franchised properties recognized during the period in our consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements refer to note 13 income taxes for information on the balances of our deferred tax assets and respective valuation allowances as of december 31 2021 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized we assume among other items the position will be examined the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position will be based on its technical merits further estimates based on a tax position’s technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss in determining whether an accrual of an estimated loss is appropriate changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these rate changes may affect future income cash flows and the fair value of the company its assets and its liabilities in certain situations we may seek to reduce volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet the objectives described above and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt our primary sensitivity is to changes in onemonth libor as the interest rate on the majority of our variablerate debt is based on this index however we intend to adjust our liborbased variable rates as permitted under the relevant debt agreements by the effective date of the libor transition which is in 2023 we use interest rate swaps in order to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability as of december 31 2021 we held interest rate swaps for a portion of the term loan through which we receive onemonth libor and pay a fixed rate we elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 

the following table sets forth the current carrying value of our contractual maturities total fair values and interest rates as of december 31 2021 for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk including longterm debt and our active interest rate swap 



 

1 excludes finance lease liabilities with carrying values totaling 208 million and other debt of consolidated vies with carrying values totaling 22 million as of december 31 2021 

2 carrying value includes unamortized deferred financing costs and discount 

3 the fixed interest rate is the weighted average of actual rates and the variable interest rate is the weighted average using the market rate prevailing as of december 31 2021 

4 excludes debt of a consolidated vie with a carrying value of 4 million as of december 31 2021 

5 the carrying value reflects the notional amount and the variable interest rate receivable is based on the market rate prevailing as of december 31 2021 we measure our derivative instruments at fair value and as of december 31 2021 this interest rate swap was in a liability position information excludes an interest rate swap with a notional amount of 16 billion which swaps onemonth libor on a portion of the term loan to a fixed rate of 183 percent with a term from march 2022 to march 2026 that had a liability fair value of 34 million as of december 31 2021 these interest rate swaps were included in other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

refer to note 11 fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value measurements of our longterm debt and interest rate swaps 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies as well as revenues and expenses from our international owned and leased hotels the value of these revenues and expenses could change materially in relation to the functional currencies of the exposed entities and to our reporting currency usd we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in relation to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2021 our largest net exposures were to aud and eur 

we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with certain of our management franchise and other fees denominated in certain foreign currencies we use forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in certain cash and intercompany loan balances  we do not consider the fair value or earnings effect of these forward contracts to be material to our consolidated financial statements

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stayathome directives in place at various times during the period resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world the reduction in travel resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the areas where our hotels are located at some point in time during 2020 having a material adverse impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 as of february 10 2021 97 percent of our global hotel properties were open while approximately 220 hotels had temporarily suspended operations in response to this global crisis we took actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests employees and owners and support our communities during the summer we launched hilton cleanstay and hilton eventready which deliver a new standard of cleanliness and customer service to our properties worldwide including for meetings and events we also found alternative uses for certain of our hotel properties including partnering with american express to donate up to one million hotel room nights for frontline medical professionals and provided financial assistance to organizations helping those affected by covid19 through our hilton effect foundation additionally we took certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to help our business withstand this uncertain time

hilton drives positive social and environmental change across our operations our supply chain and our communities through our cr strategy travel with purpose in 2018 we established our 2030 goals to double our investment in social impact and cut our environmental impact in half by 2030 our 2030 goals which align with the global sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations in 2015 are guided by our evaluation of the social and environmental issues that are critical to our business and our longterm success we engage with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to continuously refine and enhance our strategy and in 2020 we initiated a full materiality assessment to review our esg priorities to ensure alignment with the priorities of our internal and external stakeholders the results of this assessment will inform our strategy for 2021 and beyond as we work towards our 2030 goals and continue to contribute to achievement of the sdgs 

hilton recognizes the material impact that our environmental and social efforts have on our business among these we consider environmental sustainability and climate change to be a critical business risk and we are committed to reducing our carbon emissions in line with climate science we were the first hospitality brand to set sciencebased carbon reduction targets which were verified by the science based targets initiative a partnership of several worldwide environmental organizations in may 2018 we also evaluate our climate change risks and have begun to align our external esg reporting in accordance with the recommendations of the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd we use lightstay our proprietary and awardwinning cr performance management platform to measure our environmental and social impact including but not limited to carbon emissions energy water waste volunteer hours inkind donations and local partnerships use of lightstay is a global brand standard required across hilton’s entire system of hotels and corporate offices

environmental impact 

we are committed to cutting our environmental footprint in half by 2030 through energy and carbon management water stewardship waste reduction and responsible sourcing in 2020 we experienced a significant decrease in utility consumption across our global portfolio primarily as a result of reduced occupancy and the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations during the year hotel building systems cannot simply be turned off without risking damage to the asset but we trained our hotel teams to adopt operational best practices such as partial building shut downs variable plant load operation and implementation of enhanced building controls to further improve efficiencies and minimize utility costs during times of reduced occupancy and financial strain we also maintained our portfoliowide certification to iso 9001 quality management iso 14001 environmental management and iso 50001 energy management standards one of the largest iso certified portfolios of buildings in the world 

in 2020 in alignment with our sciencebased targets we took several steps to increase our sourcing of renewable energy at our hotels around the world the majority of our managed hotels in the uk as well as our watford and glasgow corporate offices began procuring 100 percent renewable electricity during the year ended december 31 2020 and we also added a renewable energy option for our managed hotels in the us further we continued our focus on our food waste reduction and food donation initiatives with all of our managed hotels in the us and canada required to have food donation programs in place during 2020 we also operate the industry’s largest soap recycling program with over 5300 of our hotels working globally with soap recycling partners to donate new soap bars to those in need we continued to work with our environmental partner world wildlife fund to evolve our environmental strategy and implement our programs globally 

we have achieved the following reductions in environmental impact since 2008

globally 2020 was a year dominated by disasters most notably the covid19 pandemic immediately elevated the need to address urgent humanitarian crises across the globe including in the communities where our hotels operate and our employees live at the pandemic’s onset hilton and its hotel ownership community partnered with american express to donate up to one million free room nights and world central kitchen to provide healthy freshly prepared meals to frontline medical professionals staying in those rooms additionally the hilton effect foundation awarded six grants to organizations directly

the year ended december 31 2020 was also plagued by a significant number of other natural and manmade disasters including the australian bushfires california wildfires one of the most active atlantic hurricane seasons on record typhoon ulysses and the beirut port explosion hilton and the foundation took a handson approach to supporting our hotel teams and surrounding communities through these disasters including providing meals hygiene kits and other support to those impacted by these events hilton recognizes the importance of supporting our employees directly impacted by disaster which is why we fund a thirdparty operated team member assistance fund tmaf to which employees and employees of franchised hotels who are not employed by hilton can apply for financial aid when impacted by disaster and extreme hardship the tmaf provided more than 500000 in financial aid to individuals in 2020 approximately 95 percent of which was for individuals directly impacted by the covid19 pandemic

human capital management 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 141000 people at our managed owned and leased properties and at our corporate locations 

we strive to be the most hospitable company in the world and we believe that an effective human capital management strategy is an essential component of that effort our strategy focuses on attracting developing and retaining the best talent in the industry and our executive committee reviews talent strategy and succession plans on a quarterly basis to assess current and future talent needs 

during 2020 in an effort to reduce current and future costs in response to the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business we made difficult decisions that impacted our employees which included the following 

• temporarily furloughing nearly 60 percent of corporate employees 

• temporarily enacting salary reductions of 10 percent to 20 percent for corporate employees and 50 percent for executive committee members 

• eliminating our chief executive officers salary from april 2020 through year end and

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager franchisor owner and lessee competition in the hospitality industry is based on several criteria generally including the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels inns and other accommodation rental services in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated systemwide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us continue to maintain our position as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are accor sa choice hotels international hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international radisson hotel group and wyndham hotels  resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters however the timing and effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in the first quarter of 2020 being the strongest quarter in the year as the remainder of the year was more significantly impacted by the reduced occupancy due to travel restrictions safety concerns and the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel including personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities tend to be more fixed than variable as a result of such fixed costs in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues we and our hotel owners experienced a downturn in the current industry cycle driven by the covid19 pandemic we expect to enter into a recovery phase in our industry cycle as vaccines and treatments for covid19 become more widely available 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employees minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations

laws or international data protection laws such as the eus general data protection regulation gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had laundry and drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of waste that we generate including at locations where such waste has been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise contracts but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and managed properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements generally us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of such hotel 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned 

and leased hotels and we maintain workers compensation coverage for all of our employees we also are selfinsured for health coverage for some of our us employees including our corporate operations and managed properties in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing global covid19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stayathome directives that have resulted in cancellations and reduced travel around the world as well as complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations for an indeterminate duration although there are effective vaccines for covid19 that have been approved for use distribution of the vaccines did not begin until late 2020 and a majority of the public will likely not have access to a vaccination until sometime in 2021 in addition new strains of the virus appear to have increased transmissibility which could complicate treatment and vaccination programs as such the covid19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 and will continue to negatively affect future results the current and uncertain future impact of the covid19 pandemic including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel and use our hotel properties for lodging food and beverage and other services is expected to continue to negatively affect our results operations outlook plans growth cash flows and liquidity 

during the pandemic the us and other national and local governments have imposed travel restrictions at various times and in some countries and us states reimposed such restrictions and a number of our hotels have fully or partially suspended operations we have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by additional governmental regulations and travel advisories to fight the pandemic including recommendations by the us department of state the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization 

we cannot predict when any of our hotels that have completely or partially suspended operations will be able to fully reopen the conditions upon which a full reopening may occur or the effects of any such conditions we also cannot predict if any of our hotels that are currently operational will have to completely or partially suspend operations in the future moreover even where travel advisories and restrictions have been lifted travel demand has been and is likely to remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if or when our properties will return to prepandemic demand or pricing although we have implemented new hygiene and cleaning standards we cannot fully predict their impact on people believing it is safe to travel adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate including higher unemployment rates declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic will also negatively affect travel demand 

the steps we have taken to reduce operating costs including temporarily reducing compensation reducing our workforce and furloughing a substantial number of our employees and further steps we may take in the future to reduce costs for us or our thirdparty hotel owners may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees if our furloughed employees do not return to work with us when the covid19 pandemic subsides including because they find new jobs during the furlough we may face operational challenges that could negatively affect hotel results guest experience and loyalty we also may face demands or requests from labor unions that represent employees at our hotels for additional compensation healthcare benefits or other terms including making payments to underfunded multiemployer pension plans for covered union employees as a result of the pandemic that could increase costs and we could experience labor issues as we implement our mitigation plans even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could still experience longterm impacts on our operating costs as a result of attempts to counteract future outbreaks of covid19 or other viruses through for example enhanced health and hygiene requirements or other such measures in one or more regions 

we cannot predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our partners such as thirdparty owners of our properties thirdparty service providers travel agencies suppliers and other vendors in particular if thirdparty owners of our hotels are unable to maintain their hotels and service indebtedness secured by their hotels our results of operations and reputation could suffer thirdparty owners of our hotels have experienced financing difficulties and significant declines in revenues thereby making it more likely that they could declare bankruptcy or face other difficulties with their lenders or other creditors bankruptcies sales or foreclosures involving our hotels could in some cases result in the termination of our management or franchise contracts and eliminate our anticipated income and cash flows including amounts currently due to us under existing agreements which would negatively affect our results of operations hotel owners with financial difficulties have been and may continue to be unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to under our existing contracts on 

a timely basis or at all current and ongoing economic conditions also could affect our ability to enter into management and franchise contracts with potential thirdparty owners of our hotels who may be unable to obtain financing or face other delays in developing hotel projects as a result some properties in our development pipeline may not enter our system when we anticipated or at all and new hotels may enter our pipeline at a slower rate than in the past thereby negatively affecting our overall growth likewise if we or our hotel owners or franchisees are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels the quality of our hotels may suffer which may negatively impact our reputation and guest loyalty and our market share may suffer as a result 

we may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our prospects and our credit ratings certain of our credit ratings have been downgraded or placed on credit watch and if our credit ratings were to be further downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be negatively affected in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations there is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations in addition because of reduced travel demand certain of our leased properties will not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses which may include rent due to the landlords of those properties if or when we determine the value of our leased properties or the carrying value of other assets has significantly declined we have recognized and may in the future recognize significant noncash impairment charges to our results of operations further to the extent the covid19 pandemic significantly impacts spending patterns of hilton honors cobranded credit cardholders or the acquisition of new cardholders we will receive lower license fees under our cobranded credit card arrangements 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could cause a global recession which would have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations the significant increase in unemployment in the us and other regions due to the adoption of social distancing and other policies to slow the spread of covid19 continues to have a sustained negative impact on travel demand the extent of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business and the travel industry at large remains highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and severity of the outbreak the timing and availability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat covid19 and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume given the uncertainty as to the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of covid19 and the imposition or relaxation of protective measures we are presently unable to estimate the full impact to our future results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

additionally the covid19 pandemic could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as we have reduced our workforce and placed many of our employees on temporary furlough our remaining employees have been required to work from home and therefore new processes procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment further should any key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work the attention of our management team could be diverted 

the potential effects of the covid19 pandemic also could intensify or otherwise affect many of our other risk factors described below including but not limited to risks inherent to the hospitality industry macroeconomic factors beyond our control competition for hotel guests and management and franchise contracts risks related to doing business with thirdparty hotel owners performance of our information technology systems growth of reservation channels outside of our system risks of doing business outside of the us and risks related to our indebtedness because the covid19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving the other potential impacts to our other risk factors below are uncertain 

risks related to our industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

• significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world 

• the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners 

• relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture contracts 

• decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks 

• changes in operating costs including employee compensation and benefits energy insurance and food and beverage 

• increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by increases in revenues in our business 

• changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs 

• the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations 

• the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs 

• significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage 

• shortages of labor or labor disruptions 

• the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries who sell our hotel rooms to guests to attract and retain customers 

• the quality of services provided by franchisees including ability to comply with relevant requirements including environment human rights and labor 

• the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligations 

• delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects 

• cyclical overbuilding in the hospitality industry 

• changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development and 

• changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

• changes in general economic conditions including low consumer confidence increases in unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy 

• conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel or result in temporary closures or other disruption at our hotel properties including travelrelated accidents outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as covid19 ebola zika avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1n1 swine flu and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 

• geopolitical activity political unrest and governmental action and uncertainty resulting from us and global political trends and policies including potential barriers to travel trade and immigration 

• war political instability or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events 

• decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions 

• statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities 

• the financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes and increased travel costs 

• perceived negative impacts of tourism on local cultures human rights and the environment 

• cyberattacks 

• climate change or availability of natural resources 

• natural climaterelated or manmade disasters and extreme weather conditions including earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes typhoons floods wildfires volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents 

• organized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics and 

• other changes in the overall demand for what we offer including the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location and may change with changes in overall availability of lodging and hospitality options within a local market based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters however the timing and effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in the first quarter of 2020 being the strongest quarter in the year as the remainder of the year was more significantly impacted by reduced occupancy due to travel restrictions safety concerns and the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis we and our hotel owners experienced a 

downturn in the current industry cycle driven by the covid19 pandemic we expect to enter into a recovery phase in our industry cycle as vaccines and treatments become more widely available the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to operating our business 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests 

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location rates for hotel rooms food and beverage and other services property size and availability of rooms and conference and meeting space accommodations and technology quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise contracts 

we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our access to and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services andor using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited we may not be able to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts could be reduced 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices perceptions of our environmental social or governance practices perception of guest or employee health or safety the occurrence of accidents or injuries cyberattacks security breaches natural disasters crime failure of suppliers franchisees or business partners to comply with relevant requirements including environmental human rights and labor requirements individual guest owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content a negative incident at one hotel could have farreaching effects including lost sales customer boycotts loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties such an incident also could subject us to legal actions including litigation governmental investigations or penalties along with the resulting additional adverse publicity a perceived 

decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to i establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and ii enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hospitality industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property while we maintain certain contractual protections repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands hiltons reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise contracts as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition use of technology safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards or based on customer demand more broadly guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2020 we had nearly 2570 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline in particular for hotels not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

since 2011 we have launched nine new brands home2 suites by hilton curio collection by hilton canopy by hilton tru by hilton tapestry collection by hilton motto by hilton lxr hotels  resorts signia by hilton and most recently tempo by hilton we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the us over the past several years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

our investments in owned and leased real property including through joint ventures subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

• governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws 

  

• fluctuations or loss in value of real estate or potential impairments in the value of our assets due to changes in market conditions in the area in which real estate or assets are located 

• increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties 

• the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term 

• periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements 

• risks associated with any mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing 

• contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property 

• costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property and 

• the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned and leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of the fixedcost structure required to own and operate a hotel further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties or exit leasing arrangements on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive than anticipated 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

• construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials 

• obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations 

• changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns 

• governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development 

• volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements 

• lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects 

• force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes wildfires floods or tsunamis or acts of terrorism and 

• design defects that could increase costs 

if our owned and leased properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty including climaterelated events we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists or at all regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture 

partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to us or the other joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we develop own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management procurement finance human resources reservations distribution and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses thirdparty criminal activity including ransomware or other malware and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location and cloud backup processes to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems our data center operations are currently located in a single facility or with a single cloudbased provider although we continue to renovate and migrate portions of our operations to cloudbased providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary physical or cloudbased facilities could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site or cloud providers damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our loyalty platform and reservation and distribution system rely on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties and cloud providers the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems and applications so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer malware changes in applicable federal state and international regulations security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and our thirdparty service providers experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time and despite our deployment of cyberattack prevention and detection techniques we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents we have in the past been subject to cyberattacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information many jurisdictions including the eu california and nevada have passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the handling of personal data we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition us states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our guest loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner in some cases hotel owners may refuse to upgrade systems or deploy new technology to replace aging or endoflife software andor hardware as a result we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our guests employees or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of confidential or otherwise sensitive data which could negatively impact our operations unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be 

obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on the internal processes and controls of thirdparty software and application vendors to maintain the security of all software code provided to or used by hilton should those vendors fail to follow security best practices to secure their products then we are at risk of unintentionally injecting malware into our systems via compromised software code they provide the occurrence of any of the foregoing could negatively affect our reputation our competitive position and our financial performance and we could face lawsuits and potential liability 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of various services that we use in the operation of our business the inability of such third parties to satisfy our or our guests requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we could be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as thirdparty alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

• issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders 

• spending cash and incurring debt 

• assuming contingent liabilities or 

• creating additional expenses 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other 

companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase these hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce bookings at our hotel properties by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected over time as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites which increases costs to hotels in our system internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business if that growth continues it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors guest loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for all of the brands that we operate program members accumulate points primarily based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise contracts contribute a percentage of the loyalty members charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotel stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with third parties such as airlines other transportation services online vendors retailers and credit card companies to sell hilton honors points for the use of their customers andor to allow hilton honors members to use or exchange points for products or services currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the us the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 119 countries and territories around the world our rooms outside the us represented approximately 28 percent 28 percent and 27 percent of our systemwide rooms for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the us including 

• rapid changes in governmental economic or political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

• increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of our licensed brands as an american brand 

• recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate 

• the effect of disruptions including the temporary closure of hotel properties caused by severe weather or climaterelated events natural disasters outbreak of disease such as covid19 or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult 

• the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws 

•   

• the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with developing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments with respect to human rights including in the supply chain 

• instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change 

• political economic and other uncertainty resulting from the uks exit from the eu commonly known as brexit the terms of which remain uncertain and could adversely affect our business 

• uncertainties as to local laws regarding and enforcement of contract and ip rights 

• forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and 

• the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from our hotels and resorts as well as the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by ofac although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and 

territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to a number of modern slavery human trafficking and forced labor reporting training and due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the future the impact of laws such as the uks modern slavery act 2015 australias modern slavery bill 2018 and similar legislation on hotel operations as well as supply chain could increase costs of operations and reduce profits 

the loss of senior executives could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 35 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 20 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to influence the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in 

regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage approximately 141000 individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to staff and manage the hotels that we manage own and lease could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of thirdparty owners additionally an increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other ip could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have a significant number of trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other ip however those trademark or other ip registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other ip in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other ip without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important ip rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our ip is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other ip are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our ip rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and ip in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other ip could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain ip from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this ip our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe ip rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other ip rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

• be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages 

• force us to stop using the ip that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged ip 

• force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services 

• require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other contracts to obtain the right to use a third party’s ip 

• limit our ability to develop new ip and 

• limit the use or the scope of our ip or other rights 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty ip claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar usd subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions however these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise own or lease our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climaterelated disaster or other catastrophic losses exists and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry andor we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable firstparty and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control such as the natural and manmade disasters and infectious diseases that occurred in 2020 could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates we anticipate increased costs of property and excess liability insurance across the portfolio in 2021 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2020 and prior periods in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property additionally certain types of losses may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive to insure in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we or owners of hotels that we manage or franchise could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

• cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages 

• cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income 

• generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties 

• expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and 

• result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program was most recently reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in december 2019 for seven years through december 31 2027 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2018 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans and our hilton honors guest loyalty program in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 817 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 13 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives as well as longlived assets principally property and equipment and operating lease rightofuse rou assets related to leased hotels we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist we evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

legal and regulatory risks 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements these requirements are complex and subject to frequent change often in connection with changes in the us presidential administration we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the construction continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including obtaining and maintaining any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs to comply with such requirements may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations 

built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise contract and negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties and landlords at leased properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years we and other hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our spinoffs 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would 

generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a tax matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial results 

pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2020 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 106 billion and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt for the years ending december 31 2021 2022 and 2023 were 56 million 29 million and 23 million respectively our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of existing debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

in addition certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses london interbank offer rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with liborbased interest rate derivatives libor has been the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and it is currently expected that libor will be discontinued after june 2023 while all of our material financing arrangements indexed to libor provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued there can be no assurances as to whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than libor we intend to monitor developments with respect to the phasing out of libor and will work to minimize the impact of any libor transition the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock 

• pay dividends including our subsidiaries paying dividends to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• make certain investments 

• incur certain liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• merge or consolidate 

• enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us 

• designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and 

• transfer or sell assets 

in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 50 to 10 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these 

covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

because we suspended our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock during 2020 you may not receive any return on your investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we suspended payment of our quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock in 2020 and have not yet reinstated it our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that one might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

• although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

• these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office 

• these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote and 

• these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

covid19 pandemic 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stayathome directives in place at various times during the period resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world the reduction in travel resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the areas where our hotels are located which included approximately 20 percent of our global hotel properties for some portion of the reporting period as such it had a material adverse impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 and based on the potential impact of additional restrictions and continued health and safety concerns we expect it to continue to have a material adverse impact on our results for an indeterminate duration as described below under —results of operations 

although the majority of our hotels that had temporarily suspended operations had reopened by the end of october 2020 travel restrictions reimposed at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 resulted in additional temporary suspensions and in some cases resuspensions as of february 10 2021 97 percent of our global hotel properties were open while approximately 220 hotels had temporarily suspended operations hotels that have reopened generally have experienced significantly lower occupancy as compared with periods before the onset of the pandemic 

in response to this global crisis we have taken actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests employees and owners and support our communities during the summer we launched hilton cleanstay to deliver a new standard of cleanliness and disinfection to our properties worldwide and hilton eventready which focuses on cleanliness and customer service specific to meetings and events we also found alternative uses for certain of our hotel properties partnering with american express to donate up to one million free room nights to frontline medical professionals through our hilton effect foundation we also provided financial assistance to organizations including world central kitchen directly responding to community needs that resulted from the covid19 pandemic additionally we have taken several steps to help our business withstand this uncertain time as detailed in —liquidity and capital resources

segments and regions 

we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products or services i management and franchise and ii ownership the management and franchise segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our brands and ip this segment generates its revenue from i management and franchise fees charged to thirdparty hotel owners ii licensing fees from hgv and strategic partnerships including cobranded credit card arrangements for the right to use certain hilton marks and ip and iii fees for managing our owned and leased hotels as a manager of hotels we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in 

exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services while a third party manages or operates such franchised hotels the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing nightly hotel room sales food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels 

geographically we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions i the americas ii europe middle east and africa emea and iii asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represents a significant portion of our systemwide hotel rooms 72 percent as of december 31 2020 therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately and as such are presented separately within the analysis herein the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

system growth and development pipeline 

our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our brand names and ip prior to approving the addition of new properties to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the property based on its geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners over time we expect to increase revenues overall return on invested capital and cash available to support our business needs while these objectives have not changed as a result of the covid19 pandemic the current economic environment has posed certain challenges to the execution of our strategy which have included and may continue to include delays in openings and new development see further discussion on our cash management policy as detailed in —liquidity and capital resources 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we opened over 410 hotels consisting of nearly 56000 rooms contributing to over 47000 net additional rooms in our system reflecting a net unit growth of 51 percent from december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 we had nearly 2570 hotels in our development pipeline that we expect to add to our system in the future representing over 397000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 116 countries and territories including 31 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels nearly all of the rooms in the development pipeline are within our management and franchise segment additionally of the rooms in the development pipeline 233000 rooms were located outside the us and 204000 rooms were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

brexit 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the uks withdrawal from the eu occurred on january 31 2020 beginning the implementation period which ended on december 31 2020 in december 2020 the uk and the eu reached a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu the euuk trade and cooperation agreement which has been approved by the member states of the eu and the uk parliament and is expected to be formally ratified by the eu parliament during the first quarter of 2021 while our results for the year ended december 31 2020 were not materially affected by brexit specifically the final outcomes are not yet certain in addition while the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provides clarity in respect of the intended future relationship between the uk and the eu and some detailed matters of trade and cooperation it remains unclear what general longterm economic financial trade and legal implications the uk withdrawal from the eu will have and how it will ultimately affect our business brexit measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and cause tax and foreign currency exchange rate volatility which could have adverse effects on our business we will continue to monitor the potential impact of brexit on our business in future periods 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

• franchise and licensing fees  represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands under our franchise contracts franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include i monthly royalty fees generally based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues as applicable and ii application initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended we also earn licensing fees from license agreements with hgv and strategic partnerships including cobranded credit card arrangements for the use of certain hilton marks and ip consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees 

• base and incentive management fees represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross revenue and when applicable an incentive fee which is typically based on the hotels operating profits and in some cases may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period outside of the us our fees are often dependent on hotel profitability measures either because of a single management fee structure where the entire fee is an incentive fee or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees 

• owned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from hotel operations including hotel room sales accommodations sold in conjunction with other services food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions sponsored by corporate social military educational religious or other organizations or associations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues 

• other revenues represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels including our purchasing operations and other operating income 

• other revenues from managed and franchised properties represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners either directly as costs are incurred or indirectly through program fees billed and collected in advance that are associated with certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties the direct reimbursements by property owners are for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally our responsibility and certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income loss or net income loss the monthly program fee that hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels that we manage pay is based on the underlying hotels sales or usage and relates to the costs of our brands and shared services including i advertising marketing and customer loyalty programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance programs we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

• consumer demand and global economic conditions  consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels among other factors declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks affecting or reducing travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate andor lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased hotel operations further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels in general several of these factors as well as health and safety concerns had a significant effect on global economic conditions and consumer demand for our products and services in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic which is expected to continue to have an overall adverse impact on our revenues for an indeterminate duration also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profitability measures as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected are currently subjecting and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility 

• contracts with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers  we depend on our longterm management and franchise contracts with thirdparty hotel owners and hotel franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

• owned and leased hotels reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expense food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory other support expenses include costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas operating telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and other services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurance 

• depreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of i amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the october 24 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of the blackstone group inc the merger which primarily include management and franchise contracts leases and our hilton honors guest loyalty program intangible ii amortization of capitalized software costs and iii depreciation of property and equipment including our finance lease rou assets such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels 

• general and administrative consists primarily of compensation costs for our corporate staff professional fees including consulting audit and legal fees travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses for uncollected management franchise and other fees and administrative and related expenses 

• other expenses  consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations and other ancillary businesses along with other operating expenses of the business 

• other expenses from managed and franchised properties represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility or paid from program fees collected from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations including those related to our brands and shared services programs we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our managed properties 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

• fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows margins and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth including that which resulted from the covid19 pandemic economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands additionally the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs however we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to expected future market conditions while continuing to optimize our customers experience and the value of our hotels and brands 

• changes in depreciation and amortization expense we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expense will increase as the finitelived intangible assets that were recorded at the merger become fully amortized amortization expense will decrease additionally changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure expenditures related to our corporate facilities or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets if we are required to recognize impairment losses relating to our depreciable assets or finitelived intangible assets the related depreciation or amortization expense respectively will decrease 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is usd and we have assets and liabilities including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate the results of those operations assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at marketbased foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods we hedge foreign exchangebased cash flow variability in certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments we also hold shortterm forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances primarily related to our intercompany financing arrangements and we elected not to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within 

the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters however the timing and effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in the first quarter of 2020 being the strongest quarter in the year as the remainder of the year was more significantly impacted by reduced occupancy due to travel restrictions safety concerns and complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results were not available of the 6422 hotels in our system as of december 31 2020 4956 hotels were classified as comparable hotels our 1466 noncomparable hotels included 123 hotels or approximately two percent of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were otherwise not available 

when considering business interruption in the context of our definition of comparable hotels any hotel that had completely or partially suspended operations on a temporary basis at any point during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic was considered to be part of the definition of comparable hotels despite these temporary suspensions of hotel operations we believe that including these hotels within our hotel operating statistics of occupancy average daily rate adr and revenue per available room revpar reflects the underlying results of our business for the year ended december 31 2020 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revpar 

revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels as previously described occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted as such comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2020 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda reflects net income loss excluding interest expense a provision for income tax benefit expense and depreciation and amortization 

adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain items including gains losses revenues and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity 

investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructurings and retirements iv furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements v sharebased compensation vi reorganization severance relocation and other related expenses vii noncash impairment viii amortization of contract acquisition costs ix the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and other expenses from managed and franchised properties and x other items 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics including among other things capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i ffe replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of ffe for owned hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffe ii sharebased compensation as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them iii the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts and iv other items such as amounts related to debt restructurings and retirements and reorganization and related severance costs that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our operating performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect income tax expenses or benefits or the cash requirements to pay our taxes 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and 

• other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 

results of operations 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced significant declines in revpar in all regions due to both occupancy and adr decreases resulting from the covid19 pandemic our asia pacific region experienced the effects of the pandemic early in 2020 with suspensions of hotel operations beginning in late january pronounced negative results and hotel suspensions in the americas and emea regions began in midmarch of the approximately 1280 properties that had suspended hotel operations at some point during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 44 percent were in the us 10 percent were in the americas excluding us 25 percent were in europe 5 percent were in mea and 16 percent were in asia pacific as of february 10 2021 the operations at approximately 220 hotels primarily located in the us and europe were temporarily suspended additionally properties that have reopened have experienced significantly lower occupancy compared with periods prior to the onset of the pandemic as business and transient demand remains lower and travel restrictions and stayathome directives are still in place in many areas 

on a global level the pervasive impact of the covid19 pandemic began in late march with its most significant adverse impact on occupancy and revpar in april systemwide occupancy showed sequential monthovermonth improvement from april through october and in the fourth quarter there was both occupancy and revpar improvement in the americas excluding us mea and asia pacific regions however travel restrictions reimposed in late 2020 resulted in additional temporary suspensions and in some cases resuspensions of hotel operations particularly in europe which led to further declines in occupancy and revpar in that region in the fourth quarter 

the table below provides a reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

1 includes severance not related to the 2020 reorganization and other items the year ended december 31 2020 also includes costs recognized for the settlement of a dispute with an owner of a managed hotel losses related to the disposal of an investment and a loan guarantee for a franchised hotel and a gain related to the reimbursement by a third party for taxes owed resulting from the sale of a hotel in a prior period the year ended december 31 2019 also includes expenses recognized in connection with the refinancings and repayments of the senior secured credit facilities 

revenues 



the covid19 pandemic and the related reduction in global travel and tourism resulted in the complete or partial suspensions and in some cases resuspensions of hotel operations at approximately 1245 of our managed and franchised properties at some point during the year ended december 31 2020 of these hotels all but approximately 220 had reopened as of december 31 2020 

on a comparable basis decreases in occupancy and adr led to reduced revpar resulting in decreases in franchise fees and management fees from our comparable managed and franchised properties for the year ended december 31 2020 revpar decreased 533 percent at our comparable franchised properties and 644 percent at our comparable managed properties resulting from reduced occupancy of 321 percentage points and 407 percentage points respectively and reduced adr of 181 percent and 214 percent respectively 

including new development and ownership type transfers from january 1 2019 to december 31 2020 we added 798 managed and franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 107984 rooms to our management and franchise segment while we have historically experienced increases to management and franchise fees as new hotels are a part of our system for full periods the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our comparable hotels outweighed the impact of these property additions in 2020 

additionally licensing and other fees decreased 98 million during the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to decreased licensing fees from both hgv due to reductions in timeshare revenues and our strategic partnerships primarily driven by lower cobranded credit cardholder spend and our strategic partnerships as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

incentive fees decreased as they are based on hotels operating profits which have declined significantly from the prior year as a result of the covid19 pandemic 



owned and leased hotel revenues decreased primarily due to the covid19 pandemic and the related reduction in global travel and tourism as a result of the covid19 pandemic approximately 35 hotels in our ownership segment the majority of which are located in europe had temporarily suspended operations at some point in time during the year ended december 31 2020 although all of these hotels had reopened at some point during the year additional and reinstated restrictions in europe during the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in the resuspension of operations at approximately 10 of these hotels on a comparable basis decreases in occupancy and adr of 521 percentage points and 211 percent respectively led to reduced revpar of 748 percent resulting in decreases in revenues from our comparable owned and leased hotels additionally owned and leased hotel revenues decreased 55 million related to properties for which the lease agreements were terminated with most of the properties transferring to our management and franchise segment 



other revenues decreased primarily due to decreased revenues from our purchasing operations related to delayed hotel improvement projects and lower volume purchasing based on reduced hotel demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

operating expenses 



owned and leased hotel expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in occupancy resulting from the covid19 pandemic and approximately 35 hotels temporarily suspending operations at some point in time during the year ended december 31 2020 further as a result of declining performance variable rent which is generally based on a percentage of hotel revenues or profits decreased at most leased hotels that have a variable rent structure however certain fixed costs of maintaining the owned and leased hotels such as fixed rent and certain minimum maintenance and utility costs even while the hotels were temporarily closed or operating with very low occupancy could not be reduced at the same rate as the hotel revenue decreases during the year additionally owned and leased hotel expenses decreased 54 million related to properties for which the lease agreements were terminated with most of the properties transferring to our management and franchise segment 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful 

the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense resulting from certain management and franchise contract intangible assets recorded at the merger fully amortizing during the year ended december 31 2020 as well as from reduced carrying values of certain intangible assets and property and equipment related to our leased properties due to impairment losses that were recognized during 2020 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense resulting from additions to capitalized software costs during 2020 and 2019 

general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of actions taken by the company during the year ended december 31 2020 to reduce or eliminate certain corporate costs in response to the covid19 pandemic which included workforce reductions temporary furloughs and salary reductions of corporate employees refer to —liquidity and capital resources for additional information these actions are expected to also reduce costs in future periods in addition sharebased compensation expense decreased primarily as a result of the reversal of expense recognized in prior periods during the year ended december 31 2020 resulting from the determination that the performance conditions of our outstanding performance shares were no longer probable of achievement partially offset by expense recorded in december 2020 as a result of the modification of these outstanding performance shares see note 15 sharebased compensation in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized reorganization costs related to activities undertaken in response to the covid19 pandemic primarily relating to reductions in our workforce and the associated costs 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 258 million of impairment losses primarily related to our ownership segment including 104 million on our ownership reporting units goodwill along with certain assets associated with specific owned and leased hotels additionally 15 million was related to management contract acquisition costs as a result of actual and expected early terminations of management contracts 

other expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in expenses from our purchasing operations resulting from reduced demand other expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 also included costs recognized for the settlement of a dispute with an owner of a managed hotel and amounts accrued related to our performance guarantees 

gain on sale of assets net 



during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a gain upon completion of the sale of the hilton odawara resort  spa hilton odawara see note 3 disposal in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonoperating income and expenses 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful 

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to the full draw down on our senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility in march 2020 and the issuances of senior notes in june 2019 april 2020 and december 2020 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our senior secured term loan facility the term loans due to a 2019 principal repayment of 500 million and a decline in its variable interest rate redemptions of senior notes in december 2020 and decreased variable interest expense for certain hotel finance 

leases due to a decline in operating performance see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness 

the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions included changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany financing arrangements including shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans the changes for both periods were the result of various currencies but primarily the euro eur and the australian dollar aud additionally during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized losses related to the liquidation of investments in foreign entities that were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss 

loss on debt extinguishments for the year ended december 31 2020 related to the redemptions of senior notes and included redemption premiums totaling 31 million and the accelerated recognition of unamortized deferred financing costs of 17 million see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these redemptions 

other nonoperating loss net for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily included losses related to a loan guarantee for a franchised hotel and the disposal of an investment and a gain related to the reimbursement by a third party for taxes owed resulting from the sale of a hotel in a prior period other nonoperating income net for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily included a loss on the disposal of an unconsolidated real estate investment and expenses recognized in connection with the refinancings and repayments of our senior secured credit facilities 

the change in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to a decrease in income before income taxes see note 13 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

segment results 

refer to note 18 business segments in our consolidated financial statements for reconciliations of revenues for our reportable segments to consolidated amounts and of segment operating income to consolidated income loss before income taxes we evaluate our business segment operating performance using segment operating income loss without allocating other revenues and expenses or general and administrative expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2020 we had total cash and cash equivalents of 3263 million including 45 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our selfinsurance programs and cash held for ffe reserves 

although we cannot presently estimate the ultimate and total financial impact of the unprecedented covid19 pandemic which is highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic we expect it will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods as such due to these uncertainties and the indeterminate length of time the pandemic will affect the hospitality industry we took certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be able to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future which included i fully drawing down on our 175 billion revolving credit facility ii suspending dividend payments and share repurchases iii implementing strict cost management measures such as temporarily halting certain marketing programs temporarily eliminating nonessential expenses including capital expenditures and reducing payroll and related costs through workforce reductions furloughs and temporary salary reductions iv consummating the april 2020 presale of hilton honors points to american express for 10 billion in cash the honors points presale v issuing 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in april 2020 and vi issuing 19 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes in december 2020 to extend debt maturities and reduce our cost of debt by repaying certain outstanding senior notes further in february 2021 we issued 15 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes to continue to extend debt maturities and reduce our cost of debt by repaying additional outstanding senior notes based on our ability to manage our liquidity position during the covid19 pandemic in january 2021 we repaid 250 million of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility see note 22 subsequent events in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 

our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures including costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels corporate expenses payroll and compensation costs taxes and compliance costs interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for required renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment while our accounts receivable balance as of december 31 2020 is less than periods prior to the start of the pandemic we are generally experiencing slower payment of certain fees due to us as such we have considered the implications of these delayed payment trends in developing our estimates of expected future credit losses see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment and corporate capital and information technology expenditures we have currently suspended dividend payments and share repurchases but expect that these activities will be reinstated and result in uses of liquidity in future periods 

we have a longterm investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases however the covid19 pandemic has caused us to temporarily change our cash management strategy as described above within the framework of our investment policy we currently intend to continue to finance our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet as of december 31 2020 and cash generated from our operations 

after considering our approach to liquidity and accessing our available sources of cash we believe that our cash position will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future based on current conditions the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity while minimizing operational costs 

we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt andor purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings open market transactions privately negotiated transactions or otherwise issuances or incurrence of new debt or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt andor purchases or retirement of outstanding debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

we formally suspended share repurchases given the current economic environment and our efforts to preserve cash and no share repurchases have been made since march 5 2020 the stock repurchase program remains authorized by the board of directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending on market conditions our capital needs and other factors prior to the suspension during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock under our repurchase program for 279 million which we funded principally with available cash as of december 31 2020 approximately 22 billion remained available for share repurchases under the program 

sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our net cash flows 



operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of decreases in cash inflows generated from our management and franchise properties and our owned and leased hotels largely as a result of decreases in systemwide revpar due to the covid19 pandemic as further discussed in —revenues the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by 10 billion of cash received in connection with the honors points presale and a decrease in cash paid for taxes of 284 million primarily resulting from a decrease in income before income taxes as well as net operating losses that were generated in 2020 in many tax jurisdictions that had taxable income in 2019 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs however in response to the covid19 pandemic we took steps to temporarily eliminate nonessential expenses including capital expenditures in 2020 our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily consisted of expenditures related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of hotels in our ownership segment and our capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations during the year ended december 31 2019 we received cash proceeds of 120 million relating to the sale of the hilton odawara that partially offset capital expenditures for property and equipment capitalized software costs and other uses of cash for investing activities 

financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a 13 billion increase in cash inflows and a 500 million decrease in cash outflows from net borrowings and repayments under our senior secured credit facilities and a 14 billion decrease in cash outflows for share repurchases and dividend payments see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our senior notes issuances and repayments which other than the related debt issuance costs and redemption premiums had the same net impact on cash flows from financing activities during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2020 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 106 billion for additional information on our total indebtedness including fully drawing down our revolving credit facility our issuances of series of senior notes totaling 29 billion aggregate principal amount our repayment of 19 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and guarantees on our debt refer to note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for information on our 250 million repayment on our revolving credit facility in january 2021 and the issuance of 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in february 2021 refer to note 22 subsequent events in our consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our cash flows from operations during the period and will continue to do so for an indeterminate period of time although our operating activities provided cash during the year ended december 31 2020 it was primarily a result of the honors points presale we took precautions to secure our cash position as discussed above and expect to be able to meet our current obligations furthermore we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to june 2024 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 



 

1 includes principal as well as estimated interest payments and excludes finance lease liabilities for our variablerate debt we have assumed a weighted average constant 30day libor rate of 015 percent as of december 31 2020 

2 includes imputed interest using a weighted average interest rate of 585 percent as of december 31 2020 

3 includes imputed interest using a weighted average interest rate of 382 percent as of december 31 2020 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2020 was 451 million this amount is excluded from the table above because these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change refer to note 13 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2020 included letters of credit of 60 million additionally we enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels to operate our marketing sales and brand programs these obligations have minimal or no net effect on our future cash flows see note 19 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations cash flows and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

impairment of goodwill and brands intangible assets 

we evaluate goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if indicators of impairment exist our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 18 business segments in our consolidated financial statements 

as part of the evaluation of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment we exercise judgment to 

• perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand intangible asset is less than its carrying value factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy regional performance and expectations and historical experience 

• decide whether to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment factors we consider when making this determination include the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value at the previous quantitative assessment and the period of time that has passed since such quantitative assessment additionally changes in the company or general economic conditions are taken into consideration and 

• perform a quantitative analysis to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment loss the estimated fair value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units and brands 

as of december 31 2020 we had 5095 million of goodwill and 4904 million of brands intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill and brands intangible assets for potential impairment and we fully impaired the goodwill attributable to our ownership reporting unit by recognizing impairment losses of 104 million during the year ended december 31 2020 see note 6 goodwill and intangible assets and note 11 fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

impairment of certain finitelived assets 

if we determine there are indicators of impairment we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets operating and finance lease rou assets and property and equipment for potential impairment as an asset group by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the assets 

as part of the process we exercise judgment to 

• determine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy regional performance and expectations historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific information 

• determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group forwardlooking growth rate estimates are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources and 

• determine the asset group fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models as well as appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available for a specific asset group current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate applied to forwardlooking projections takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 62 million 772 million and 346 million of other lease intangible assets net operating lease rou assets and property and equipment net respectively during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized impairment losses of 46 million 65 million and 28 million respectively on these assets see note 11 fair 

value measurements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

leases 

we record lease liabilities as the present value of the future minimum lease payments using a discount rate that is either the rate implicit in the lease if available or our incremental borrowing rate adjusted for collateral the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is estimated on a portfolio basis and reflects factors such as the term of the lease and the currency in which the lease payments will be made the determination of the estimate of lease liabilities utilizes various assumptions that require judgment including our adjustment for collateral economic factors including currency data and our credit risk the rou asset is measured at the amount of the lease liability with applicable adjustments 

as of december 31 2020 we had 14 billion of lease liabilities if circumstances arise such as a modification of an existing lease that require the reassessment of the collateralized incremental borrowing rate changes in the estimates previously used for such a modified arrangement could result in material changes to our lease liabilities 

hilton honors 

hilton honors records a point redemption liability for amounts received from participating hotels and strategic partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any changes to the program including devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in the number of points required to redeem a reward any amounts received from participating hotels and strategic partners in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon point redemption or licensing fees as applicable we recognize revenue for point redemptions in the amount we expect to retain in excess of the cost per point inclusive of estimated breakage and limit the revenue recognized to an amount that is probable to not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized when breakage occurs 

in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program we earn fees from cobranded credit card arrangements for the use of our ip license and the issuance of hilton honors points the allocation of the overall fees from the cobranded credit card arrangements between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relieffromroyalty valuation method using statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment including estimates of credit card usage an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the projected cash flows the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the cobranded credit card arrangements is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above adjusted for an appropriate margin 

as of december 31 2020 we had a 25 billion liability for guest loyalty program including 703 million reflected as a current liability and deferred revenues related to hilton honors excluding strategic partnerships of 249 million including 70 million reflected as a current liability changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues 

as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business we reassessed the expected redemption rate of our hilton honors points the reevaluation as of march 31 2020 resulted in reclassifications of the liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues from current to long term of 221 million and 50 million respectively we continued to use the revised methodology subsequent to march 31 2020 further during 2020 we extended the temporary suspension of the expiration of hilton honors points through december 31 2021 as a result we adjusted our estimates of breakage to include among other factors the anticipated point expirations that will occur on december 31 2021 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately 

realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized we assume among other items the position will be examined the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position will be based on its technical merits further estimates based on a tax position’s technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if an entity in which we hold an interest is considered to be a vie we use judgment evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these rate changes may affect future income cash flows and the fair value of the company its assets and its liabilities in certain situations we may seek to reduce volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet the objectives described above and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt our primary sensitivity is to changes in onemonth libor as the interest rate on our variablerate debt is based on this index we use interest rate swaps in order to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability as of december 31 2020 we held interest rate swaps through which we receive onemonth libor and pay a fixed rate on a portion of the term loans we elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2020 for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk including longterm debt and an interest rate swap for longterm debt the table presents contractual maturities and related weighted average interest rates for the interest rate swap the table presents the notional amount and weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity date fixed rates are the weighted average actual rates and variable rates are the weighted average market rates prevailing as of december 31 2020

2 carrying value includes unamortized deferred financing costs and discount 

3 the carrying value reflects the notional amount we measure our derivative instruments at fair value and as of december 31 2020 this interest rate swap was in a liability position 

4 excludes an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 16 billion which swaps onemonth libor on the term loans to a fixed rate of 303 percent with a term for the period from march 2022 to march 2023 the interest rate swap had a liability fair value of 45 million as of december 31 2020 

5 represents the interest rate receivable 

6 represents the interest rate payable 

refer to note 11 fair value measurements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value measurements of our derivatives and financial assets and liabilities 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses the value of these revenues and expenses could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities and to our reporting currency usd we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain 

intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2020 our largest net exposures were to aud and eur 

we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our management and franchise fees denominated in certain foreign currencies we use forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in certain cash and intercompany loan balances  we do not consider the fair value or earnings effect of these forward contracts to be material to our consolidated financial statements

our business 

as of december 31 2019 our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 

1 includes hotels owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling financial interest 

management and franchise 

we manage hotels and license our brands through our management and franchise segment this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners as well as from fees associated with license agreements we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross revenue and when applicable an incentive management fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotels operating profits and may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotels sales or usage which covers the costs of i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance program expenses owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2019 we managed 703 hotels with 221615 rooms excluding hotels included in our ownership segment 

the initial terms of our management contracts are typically 20 to 30 years in certain cases we are both the franchisor and manager of the hotel when we enter into a franchise contract in addition to a management contract and we classify the hotel as managed in our portfolio extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels generally these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for either five or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement 

some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

franchising 

we license our brand names trademarks and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts we do not own manage or operate franchised properties and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards that we establish are maintained for newly franchised hotels including both new construction and conversions of existing hotels from other brands we approve the location as well as the plans for the facilities to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards for existing franchised hotels we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards so that they can remain in our hotel system we also earn license fees from a license agreement with hgv and cobrand credit card arrangements for the use of certain hilton marks and ip 

each franchisee pays us an application initiation or other fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues as applicable additionally the franchisees generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotels sales or usage which covers the costs of i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance program expenses franchisees are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2019 we franchised 5342 properties with 729608 rooms 

our franchise contracts typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new hotels and approximately 10 to 20 years for hotels converting from brands outside our system at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager franchisor and owner competition in the hospitality industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels inns and other accommodation rental services in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated systemwide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us continue to maintain our position as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa choice hotels international hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international radisson hotel group and wyndham hotels  resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within 

the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result of such fixed costs in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employees minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain properties in puerto rico and egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

as an international manager franchisor owner and lessee of properties in 119 countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals in addition some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the united kingdoms uk bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations the european unions eu general data protection regulation gdpr effective in 2018 has stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data such as credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information that we collect for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes 

environmental matters 

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had laundry and drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of waste that we generate including at locations where such waste has been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise contracts but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and managed properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of such hotel 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels and we maintain workers compensation coverage for all of our employees in addition through our captive insurance subsidiary we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

• significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world 

• changes in operating costs including employee compensation and benefits energy insurance and food and beverage 

• increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by increases in revenues in our business 

• changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages prices interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs 

• the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations 

• the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs 

• significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage 

• shortages of labor or labor disruptions 

• the ability of thirdparty internet and other travel intermediaries who sell our hotel rooms to guests to attract and retain customers 

• the quality of services provided by franchisees including ability to comply with relevant requirements including environment human rights and labor 

• the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and thirdparty hotel owners to fund investments capital expenditures and service debt obligations 

• delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects 

• the financial condition of thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners 

• relationships with thirdparty property owners developers and joint venture partners including the risk that owners may terminate our management franchise or joint venture contracts 

• cyclical overbuilding in the hospitality industry 

• changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development 

• changes in the supply and demand for hotel services including rooms food and beverage and other products and services and 

• decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to inperson meetings including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

• changes in general economic conditions including low consumer confidence increases in unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the us or global economy 

• geopolitical activity such as the uks january 31 2020 exit from the eu commonly known as brexit or the recent political unrest in hong kong and governmental action and uncertainty resulting from us and global political trends and policies including potential barriers to travel trade and immigration 

• war political instability or civil unrest terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events 

• decreased corporate or government travelrelated budgets and spending as well as cancellations deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions 

• statements actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travelrelated activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities 

• the financial and general business condition of the airline automotive and other transportationrelated industries and its effect on travel including decreased airline capacity and routes and increased travel costs 

• conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel or result in temporary closures or other disruption at our hotel properties including travelrelated accidents outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases such as ebola zika avian flu severe acute respiratory syndrome sars h1n1 swine flu the coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 

• perceived negative impacts of tourism on local cultures human rights and the environment 

• cyberattacks 

• climate change or availability of natural resources 

• natural or manmade disasters and extreme weather conditions including earthquakes tsunamis tornadoes hurricanes eg hurricanes barry and dorian in 2019  typhoons floods wildfires volcanic eruptions oil spills and nuclear incidents 

• organized labor activities which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics and 

• other changes in the overall demand for what we offer including the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location and may change with changes in overall availability of lodging and hospitality options within a local market based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests 

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location rates for hotel rooms food and beverage and other services property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise contracts 

we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our access to and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts could be reduced 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices perceptions of our environmental social or governance practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries cyberattacks security breaches natural disasters crime failure of suppliers franchisees or business partners to comply with relevant requirements including environmental human rights and labor requirements individual guest owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content a negative incident at one hotel could have farreaching effects including lost sales customer boycotts loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties such an incident also could subject us to legal actions including litigation governmental investigations or penalties along with the resulting additional adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hospitality industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property while we maintain certain contractual protections repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our 

hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands hiltons reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise contracts as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition use of technology safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2019 we had more than 2570 hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline in particular for hotels not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

since 2011 we have launched nine new brands home2 suites by hilton curio collection by hilton canopy by hilton tru by hilton tapestry collection by hilton motto by hilton lxr hotels  resorts signia by hilton and most recently tempo by hilton we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the us over the past several years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

our investments in owned and leased real property including through joint ventures subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

• governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations including tax environmental zoning and eminent domain laws 

  

• fluctuations or loss in value of real estate or potential impairments in the value of our assets due to changes in market conditions in the area in which real estate or assets are located 

• increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties 

• the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term 

• periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements 

• risks associated with any mortgage debt including the possibility of default fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing 

• contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property 

• costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property and 

• the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of the fixedcost structure required to own and operate a hotel further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive than anticipated 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

• construction delays or cost overruns including labor and materials 

• obtaining zoning occupancy and other required permits or authorizations 

• changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns 

• governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development 

• volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements 

• lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenuegenerating activities during construction modernization or renovation projects 

• force majeure events including earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes wildfires floods or tsunamis or acts of terrorism and 

• design defects that could increase costs 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists or at all regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to us or the other joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we develop own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management procurement finance human resources reservations distribution and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses thirdparty criminal activity including ransomware or other malware and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility although we are renovating and migrating portions of our operations to cloudbased providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to 

conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our loyalty platform and reservation and distribution system rely on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer malware changes in applicable federal state and international regulations security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and our thirdparty service providers experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time and despite our deployment of cyberattack prevention and detection techniques we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents we have in the past been subject to cyberattacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information for example the eu california and nevada have all passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the handling of personal data we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition us states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our guest loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our guests team members or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of confidential or otherwise sensitive data which could negatively impact our operations unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct the occurrence of any of the foregoing could negatively affect our reputation our competitive position and our financial performance and we could face lawsuits and potential liability 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of various services that we use in the operation of our business the inability of such third parties to satisfy our or our guests requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we could be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as thirdparty alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

• issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders 

• spending cash and incurring debt 

• assuming contingent liabilities or 

• creating additional expenses 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able 

to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce bookings at our hotel properties by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites which increases costs to hotels in our system internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business if that growth continues it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel websites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to 

affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors guest loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points primarily based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise contracts contribute a percentage of the loyalty members charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with third parties such as airlines other transportation services online vendors retailers and credit card companies to sell honors points for the use of their customers andor to allow honors members to use or exchange points for products or services currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the us the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 119 countries and territories around the world our rooms outside the us represented approximately 28 percent 27 percent and 26 percent of our systemwide rooms for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the us including 

• rapid changes in governmental economic or political policy political or civil unrest acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or us antiboycott legislation 

• increases in antiamerican sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand 

• recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate 

• the effect of disruptions including the temporary closure of hotel properties caused by severe weather natural disasters outbreak of disease such as the coronavirus or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult 

• the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws 

•   

• the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate nonus earnings in a taxefficient manner 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations including foreign ownership restrictions import and export controls tariffs embargoes increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws 

• the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with developing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments with respect to human rights including in the supply chain 

• instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic regulatory or political conditions including inflation recession interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change 

• political economic and other uncertainty resulting from brexit the terms of which remain uncertain and could adversely affect our business 

• uncertainties as to local laws regarding and enforcement of contract and ip rights 

• forced nationalization of our properties by local state or national governments and 

• the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from our hotels and resorts as well as the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

specifically with respect to concerns regarding the spread of the coronavirus as of the date of this annual report on form 10k it appears the outbreak has largely been concentrated in china although cases have been confirmed in other countries the extent to which our results are affected by the coronavirus will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact among others 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to a number of modern slavery human trafficking and forced labor reporting training and due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the 

future the impact of laws such as the uks modern slavery act 2015 australias modern slavery bill 2018 and frances duty of vigilance law 2017 on hotel operations as well as supply chain could increase costs of operations and reduce profits 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 31 percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 23 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage more than 173000 individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to staff and manage the hotels that we manage own and lease could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of thirdparty owners additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other ip could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have more than 6000 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other ip however those trademark or other ip registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other ip in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other ip without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our 

rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important ip rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our ip is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other ip are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our ip rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and ip in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other ip could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain ip from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this ip our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe ip rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other ip rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

• be expensive and time consuming to defend and result in significant damages 

• force us to stop using the ip that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged ip 

• force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services 

• require us to enter into royalty licensing coexistence or other contracts to obtain the right to use a third party’s ip 

• limit our ability to develop new ip and 

• limit the use or the scope of our ip or other rights 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty ip claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar usd subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions however these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise own or lease our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses exists and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry andor we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable firstparty and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control such as the natural and manmade disasters that occurred in 2019 could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates we anticipate increased costs of property insurance across the portfolio in 2020 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2019 in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we or owners of hotels that we manage or franchise could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

• cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages 

• cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods resulting in a loss of income 

• generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties 

• expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks and 

• result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks particularly for properties in target areas all of which could adversely affect our results 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program was most recently reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in december 2019 for seven years through december 31 2027 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2027 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2017 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans and our hilton honors guest loyalty program in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 817 million excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 13 income taxes in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives as well as longlived assets principally property and equipment and operating lease rightofuse rou assets including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise contract and negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years we and other hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our spinoffs 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter 

ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spinoffs we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial results 

pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2019 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 81 billion and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt for the years ending december 31 2020 2021 and 2022 were 37 million 30 million and 22 million respectively our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to increased interest expense as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness whether fixed or floating rate interest to be higher than they would be otherwise 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development satisfaction of debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

in addition certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses london interbank offer rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with liborbased interest rate derivatives libor has been the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and it is currently expected that libor will be discontinued after 2021 while all of our material financing arrangements indexed to libor provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued there can be no assurances as to whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than libor we intend to monitor developments with respect to the phasing out of libor and will work to minimize the impact of any libor transition the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

• incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock 

• pay dividends including to us and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase capital stock 

• make certain investments 

• incur certain liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• merge or consolidate 

• enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us 

• designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries and 

• transfer or sell assets 

in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 50 to 10 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and 

exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control 

our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the trading symbol hlt the capital and credit markets have on occasion experienced periods of extreme volatility and disruption the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance in the past securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time 

although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

future issuances of common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or issuance of shares of preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities may dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock because our decision to issue additional equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future issuances also we cannot predict the effect if any of future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sales on the market price of our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that one might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

• although we do not have a stockholder rights plan and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

• these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office 

• these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote and 

• these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire

in january 2020 we launched our newest brand tempo by hilton an approachable lifestyle hotel brand dedicated to exceeding the expectations of an emerging and discerning class of traveler the modern achiever pioneering a new hospitality category tempo by hilton offers accommodations thoughtfully designed to help guests relax and recharge 

segments and regions 

we analyze our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products or services i management and franchise and ii ownership the management and franchise segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our brands this segment generates its revenue from i management and franchise fees charged to thirdparty hotel owners ii licensing fees from hgv and strategic partnerships for the right to use certain hilton marks and ip and iii fees for managing our owned and leased hotels as a manager of hotels we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing nightly hotel room sales food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels 

geographically we conduct business through three distinct geographic regions i the americas ii europe middle east and africa emea and iii asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represented 72 percent of our systemwide hotel rooms as of december 31 2019 therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately and as such are presented separately within the analysis herein the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

system growth and development pipeline 

our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management services or license our brand names and ip prior to approving the addition of 

new properties to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the property based on its geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners we expect to increase overall return on invested capital and cash available for return to stockholders 

as of december 31 2019 we had more than 2570 hotels in our development pipeline that we expect to add as open hotels in our system representing over 387000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 116 countries and territories including 35 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels all of the rooms in the development pipeline are within our management and franchise segment additionally of the rooms in the development pipeline 215000 rooms were located outside the us and 193000 rooms were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

brexit 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit which occurred on january 31 2020 the effects of brexit will depend on the final terms on which the uk will leave the eu including the terms of any trade agreements that will dictate the uk’s access to eu markets either during the transitional period which has a deadline of december 31 2020 or more permanently while our results for the year ended december 31 2019 were not materially affected by brexit the final outcomes are not yet certain brexit measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and cause tax and foreign currency volatility which could have adverse effects on our business we will continue to monitor the potential impact of brexit on our business as the transitional period deadline approaches and the final terms of the uks exit are determined 

other developments 

as of the date of this annual report on form 10k it appears the reported coronavirus outbreak has largely been concentrated in china although cases have been confirmed in other countries the extent to which our future results are affected by the coronavirus will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact among other 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

• franchise and licensing fees  represents fees earned in connection with the licensing of one of our brands under our franchise contracts franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include i monthly royalty fees generally based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues as applicable and ii application initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system when there is a change of ownership of a hotel or when contracts with properties already in our system are extended we also earn licensing fees from a license agreement with hgv and strategic partnerships for the use of certain hilton marks and ip consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into franchise contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to franchise and licensing fees 

• base and incentive management fees represents fees earned in connection with the management of hotels terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotels monthly gross revenue and when applicable an incentive fee which is typically based on the hotels operating profits and may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner normally over a onecalendar year period outside of the us our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee consideration to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management contracts with us is amortized over the life of the applicable contract as a reduction to base and other management fees 

• owned and leased hotels represents revenues derived from hotel operations including nightly hotel room sales accommodations sold in conjunction with other services food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers transient and group transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings conferences or social functions sponsored by corporate social military educational religious or other organizations or associations group business usually includes a block of room accommodations as well as other ancillary services such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotels as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues 

• other revenues represents revenues generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned leased managed and franchised hotels including our purchasing operations and other operating income 

• other revenues from managed and franchised properties represents amounts that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners either directly as we incur costs or indirectly through program fees billed and collected each month that are associated with certain costs and expenses supporting the operations of the related properties the direct reimbursements by property owners are for payroll and related costs if the property employees are legally our responsibility and certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties revenues and expenses for these direct reimbursements have no net effect on operating income loss or net income loss the monthly program fee that hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels we manage pay is based on the underlying hotels sales or usage and covers the costs of i advertising marketing and customer loyalty programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance programs we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

• consumer demand and global economic conditions  consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels among other factors declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions risks affecting or reducing travel patterns lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate andor lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations further competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels also declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees which is based on hotel profitability measures as a result changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility 

• contracts with thirdparty owners and franchisees and relationships with developers  we depend on our longterm management and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with thirdparty owners and franchisees our relationships with these third parties also generate new incremental opportunities for property development that can support our growth growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees related to hotels in development are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development maintenance and renovation of properties we believe that we have good relationships with our thirdparty owners franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any one particular third party 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

• owned and leased hotels reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels including room expense food and beverage costs other support costs and property expenses room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping laundry and front desk staff as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage inventory other support expenses consist of costs associated with propertylevel management utilities sales and marketing operating hotel spas telephones parking and other guest recreation entertainment and other services property expenses include property taxes repairs and maintenance rent and insurance 

• depreciation and amortization these are noncash expenses that primarily consist of i amortization of intangible assets that were recorded at their fair value at the time of the october 24 2007 transaction whereby we became a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of the blackstone group inc formerly known as the blackstone group lp blackstone which include management and franchise contracts leases and our hilton honors guest loyalty program intangible ii amortization of capitalized software costs and iii depreciation of property and equipment such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels 

• general and administrative consists primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments professional fees including consulting audit and legal fees travel and entertainment expenses bad debt expenses for uncollected management franchise and other fees and administrative and related expenses 

• other expenses  consists of expenses incurred by our purchasing operations and other ancillary businesses along with other operating expenses of the business 

• other expenses from managed and franchised properties represents certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility or paid from program fees collected from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties operations including those related to our brand and shared service programs we are contractually required to use these fees solely for these programs we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties or certain of our foreign managed properties 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

• fixed expenses many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed these expenses include personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flows margins and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs including the deferral or cancellation of capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands additionally the general and administrative expenses of operating a global business also include fixed personnel costs rent property taxes insurance and utilities the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts related to owning and leasing hotels or corporate operations is limited by the amount of inherent fixed costs however we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions while continuing to optimize our customers experience and the value of our hotels and brands 

• changes in depreciation and amortization expense we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and as those projects are completed and placed into service amortization expense will increase additionally changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels acquisition or development of new hotels the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets as we place new assets into service we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is usd and we have assets and liabilities including those that are payable or receivable by consolidated subsidiaries denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate the results of those operations assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at marketbased foreign currency exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates experienced between those periods we hedge foreign exchangebased cash flow variability in certain of our fees using forward contracts designated as hedging instruments we also hold shortterm forward contracts to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain of our foreign currency denominated cash balances primarily related to our intercompany financing arrangements and we elected not to designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 6055 hotels in our system as of december 31 2019 4556 hotels were classified as comparable hotels our 1499 noncomparable hotels included 255 hotels or approximately four percent of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the last twelve months because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable average daily rate pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates charged to customers have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room revpar 

revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels as previously described occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted as such comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2019 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda reflects net income loss excluding interest expense a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 

adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain items including gains losses revenues and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructurings and retirements iv furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements v reorganization costs vi sharebased compensation expense vii noncash impairment losses viii severance relocation and other expenses ix amortization of contract acquisition costs x the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties and xi other items 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and the provision for income taxes are dependent on company specifics including among other things capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i ffe replacement reserves to be consistent with the treatment of ffe for owned hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffe ii sharebased compensation expense as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them iii the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts and iv other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect a provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay our taxes 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 

• ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and 

• other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations 

results of operations 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2019 we experienced modest systemwide revpar growth largely driven by occupancy growth continued strength in europe resulted primarily from adr and occupancy growth in southern europe particularly italy and turkey which was partially offset by rate declines in russia in the americas excluding us results were attributable to both adr and occupancy growth in colombia and brazil offset by decreases in revpar in canada and mexico revpar growth in the us was primarily a result of group performance asia pacific results were primarily driven by declining revpar in china resulting from the continued economic slowdown international trade challenges and the protests in hong kong also contributing to asia pacific results was declining revpar in australia which was offset by revpar growth in japan malaysia and india mea experienced a decline in revpar resulting from decreased adr in united arab emirates partially offset by improved results in egypt and saudi arabia 

the table below provides a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

1 for the year ended december 31 2019 includes impairment losses and for all periods includes expenses recognized in connection with the refinancings and repayments of the senior secured credit facilities severance and other items 

revenues 



our franchise and licensing fees and management fees increased primarily as a result of the addition of new properties to our management and franchise segment including new development and ownership type transfers from january 1 2018 to december 31 2019 we added 827 managed and franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 116499 rooms to our management and franchise segment as new hotels stabilize in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods 

franchise fees from our comparable franchised properties increased as a result of increased revpar of 06 percent due to increases in both adr and occupancy licensing and other fees increased 69 million which included an increase in termination fees of 17 million primarily related to the redevelopment of a franchised hotel 

management fees increased despite unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates which decreased revenues by 8 million on a currency neutral basis base and other management fees increased as a result of an increase in revpar at our comparable managed hotels of 08 percent and termination fees that were recognized in 2019 while incentive management fees remained flat 



owned and leased hotel revenues decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which decreased revenues by 54 million on a currency neutral basis revenues at our comparable owned and leased 

hotels increased 31 million due to an increase in revpar of 35 percent driven by increases in both adr and occupancy on a currency neutral basis revenues at our noncomparable owned and leased hotels decreased by 39 million on a net basis primarily due to leased hotels converting to managed or franchised hotels and the sale of the hilton odawara resort  spa hilton odawara which subsequently became a managed hotel during the year as well as hotels that were under renovation during 2019 partially offset by increases in revenues from hotels that were under renovation in 2018 



other revenues increased primarily due to an increase in revenues from our purchasing operations 

operating expenses 



owned and leased hotel expenses decreased primarily as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which decreased expenses by 54 million on a currency neutral basis owned and leased hotel expenses decreased due to a 27 million decrease in expenses at our noncomparable hotels resulting from leased hotels converting to managed or franchised hotels and the sale of the hilton odawara partially offset by increases in expenses from hotels that were under renovation in 2018 the decrease in expenses at our noncomparable hotels was partially offset by a slight increase in expenses at our comparable hotels due to increased occupancy 



the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense as a result of capitalized software costs that were placed into service from january 1 2018 to december 31 2019 

general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in general corporate expenses partially offset by an increase in sharebased compensation costs driven by company performance 

other expenses increased as a result of impairment losses recognized in 2019 and an increase in expenses from our purchasing operations 

gain on sale of assets net 



 

1 fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful 

in september 2019 we recognized a gain upon completion of the sale of the hilton odawara see note 3 disposal in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonoperating income and expenses 



the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the issuances of the 10 billion 4875 senior notes due 2030 the 2030 senior notes in june 2019 and the 15 billion 5125 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 senior notes in april 2018 the increased interest expense due to debt issuances was partially offset by decreased interest expense related to our senior secured term loan facility the term loans as a result of the reduction of the interest rate in december 2018 and principal repayments of 500 million and 800 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively see note 9 debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness 

the losses on foreign currency transactions primarily resulted from certain intercompany financing arrangements including shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans with the australian dollar aud and the euro eur having the most significant effect during the year ended december 31 2019 for the year ended december 31 2018 the changes were related to aud eur and the british pound 

other nonoperating income net decreased primarily due to a loss that was recognized during the year ended december 31 2019 on the disposal of an unconsolidated real estate investment and a gain that was recognized during the year ended december 31 2018 on the refinancing of a loan we issued to finance the construction of a hotel that we manage additionally other nonoperating income net during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 included expenses recognized in connection with the refinancings and repayments of our senior secured credit facilities 

the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in income before income taxes and the sale of the hilton odawara which were partially offset by i the adjustments to provisional amounts related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and ii the tax effect of a stock distribution of one of our subsidiaries which were recognized in 2018 see note 13 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

segment results

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2019 we had total cash and cash equivalents of 630 million including 92 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our selfinsurance programs and cash held for ffe reserves 

our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures including costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels corporate expenses payroll and compensation costs taxes and compliance costs interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment our longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment dividends as declared share repurchases and corporate capital and information technology expenditures 

we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases within the framework of our investment policy we finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations we believe that this cash and from timetotime the use of our senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity while minimizing operational costs 

we may from time to time issue or incur or increase our capacity to incur new debt andor purchase our outstanding debt through underwritten offerings open market transactions privately negotiated transactions or otherwise issuances or incurrence of new debt or an increase in our capacity to incur new debt andor purchases or retirement of outstanding debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we returned over 17 billion to shareholders by repurchasing 169 million shares of our common stock for 15 billion and paying dividends of 172 million which were both funded principally with borrowings and available cash as of december 31 2019 approximately 515 million remained available for share repurchases under our 35 billion stock repurchase program 

sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our net cash flows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels 

the 129 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of improved operating results from our management and franchise business including net property additions and an increase in licensing and other fees the increase was partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and income taxes 

investing activities 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily consisted of expenditures related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of hotels in our ownership segment our capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations additionally cash used for investing activities during the year ended december 31 2019 was offset by the proceeds from the sale of the hilton odawara and during the year ended december 31 2018 by the repayment of a loan we issued that financed the construction of a hotel that we manage 

financing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in repurchases of common stock due to the 2018 repurchases of shares from hna tourism group co ltd and certain affiliates of blackstone as part of the full divestiture of their respective investments in hilton as well as a decrease in repayments on the term loans of 300 million the decrease in net cash used was partially offset by a 500 million decrease in proceeds received from the 10 billion senior notes issuance in june 2019 when compared to the 15 billion senior notes issuance in april 2018 additionally the year ended december 31 2019 included net proceeds of 195 million from borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2019 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 81 billion for additional information on our total indebtedness availability under our revolving credit facility and guarantees on our debt refer to note 9 debt and note 22 condensed consolidating guarantor financial information in our consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures issue additional equity securities or make draws on our revolving credit facility our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 



 

1 includes principal as well as estimated interest payments and excludes finance lease liabilities for our variablerate debt we have assumed a weighted average constant 30day libor rate of 179 percent as of december 31 2019 

2 includes estimated interest payments using a weighted average interest rate of 583 percent as of december 31 2019 

3 includes imputed interest using a weighted average interest rate of 376 percent as of december 31 2019 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2019 was 395 million this amount is excluded from the table above because these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change refer to note 13 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019 included letters of credit of 60 million and guarantees with possible cash outlays of approximately 20 million for estimated probable exposure additionally we enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels to operate our marketing sales and brand programs these obligations have minimal or no net effect on our future cash flows see note 19 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations cash flows and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

impairment of certain finitelived assets 

if we determine there are indicators of impairment we evaluate the carrying value of our specifically identifiable lease intangible assets rou assets and property and equipment for potential impairment as an asset group if we determine there are indicators of impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the assets 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

• determine if there are indicators of impairment present factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy regional performance and expectations historical experience capital costs and other assetspecific information 

• determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group forwardlooking growth rate estimates are based on historical operating results as well as various internal projections and external sources and 

• determine the asset group fair value when required in determining the fair value we often use internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models as well as appraisals recent similar transactions in the market and if appropriate and available current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions as well as capitalization rates which are based on location property or asset type marketspecific dynamics and overall economic performance the discount rate applied to forwardlooking projections takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerations 

as of december 31 2019 we had 114 million 867 million and 380 million of other lease intangible assets net operating lease rightofuse assets and property and equipment net respectively changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

leases 

we record lease liabilities as the present value of the future minimum lease payments using a discount rate that is either the rate implicit in the lease if available or our incremental borrowing rate adjusted for collateral the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is estimated on a portfolio basis and reflects factors such as the term of the lease and the currency in which the lease payments will be made the determination of the estimate of lease liabilities utilizes various assumptions that require judgment including our adjustment for collateral economic factors including currency data and our credit risk the rou asset is measured at the amount of the lease liability with applicable adjustments refer to note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of december 31 2019 we had 14 billion of lease liabilities if circumstances arise such as a modification of an existing lease that require the reassessment of the collateralized incremental borrowing rate changes in the estimates previously used for such a modified arrangement could result in material changes to our lease liabilities 

hilton honors 

hilton honors records a point redemption liability for amounts received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay any amounts received from participating hotels and program partners in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon point redemption 

in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program we earn fees from cobrand credit card arrangements for the use of our ip license and the issuance of hilton honors points the allocation of the overall fees from the cobrand credit card arrangements between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relieffromroyalty valuation method using statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment including estimates of credit card usage an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the projected cash flows the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions of hilton honors points under the cobrand credit card arrangements is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions as the point redemption liability discussed above adjusted for an appropriate margin 

as of december 31 2019 we had a 1859 million liability for guest loyalty program including 799 million reflected as a current liability and deferred revenues related to hilton honors of 396 million including 161 million reflected as a current liability changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized we assume among other items the position will be examined the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position should be based on its technical merits further estimates based on a tax position’s technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent 

likely of being realized upon settlement changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued as a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidation 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if an entity in which we hold an interest is considered to be a vie we use judgment evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and the fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet the objectives described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt we are most vulnerable to changes in onemonth libor as the interest rate on our variablerate debt is based on this index we use interest rate swaps in order to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability as of december 31 2019 we held interest rate swaps through which we receive onemonth libor and pay a fixed rate on a portion of the term loans we elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2019 for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk including longterm debt and an interest rate swap for longterm debt the table presents contractual maturities and related weighted average interest rates for the interest rate swap the table presents the notional amount and weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity date fixed rates are the weighted average actual rates and variable rates are the weighted average market rates prevailing as of december 31 2019

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses the value of these revenues and expenses could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities and to our reporting currency usd we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain 

intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2019 our largest net exposures were to aud and eur 

we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our management and franchise fees denominated in certain foreign currencies we use forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in certain cash and intercompany loan balances  we do not consider the fair value of earnings effect of these forward contracts to be material to our consolidated financial statements

our business 

as of december 31 2018  our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 

 

management and franchise 

we manage hotels and license our brands through our management and franchise segment this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners as well as from fees associated with license agreements we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross revenue and when applicable an incentive management fee which is typically based on a percentage of the hotels operating profits in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotels sales or usage which covers the costs of i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance program expenses owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2018  we managed 689  hotels with 215437  rooms excluding hotels included in our ownership segment 

the initial terms of our management contracts are typically 20 to 30 years  in certain cases we are both the franchisor and manager of the hotel when we enter into a franchise contract in addition to a management contract and we classify the hotel as managed in our portfolio extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for either five or 10 years  and can be exercised at our or the hotel owners option or by mutual agreement 

some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

franchising 

we license our brand names trademarks and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts we do not own manage or operate franchised properties and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards that we establish are maintained for newly franchised hotels including both new construction and conversions of existing hotels from other brands we approve the location as well as the plans for the facilities to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards for existing franchised hotels we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards so that they can remain in our hotel system we also earn license fees from a license agreement with hgv and cobrand credit card arrangements for the use of certain hilton marks and ip 

each franchisee pays us an application initiation or other fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s monthly gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues as applicable additionally the franchisees generally pay a monthly program fee based on the underlying hotels sales or usage which covers the costs of i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance program expenses franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2018  we franchised 4925  properties with 675803  rooms 

our franchise contracts typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new hotels and approximately 10 to 20 years  for converted hotels at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise contract 

is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages we have no legal responsibility for the employees or the liabilities associated with operating franchised properties 

ownership 

as a hotel owner and lessee we focus on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things maximizing hotel revenues implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to hotel and asset management we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their market position and at many of our hotels we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability as of december 31 2018  our ownership segment consisted of 71  hotels with 21720  rooms that we owned or leased or that are owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling financial interest 

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel and resort manager franchisor and owner competition in the hospitality industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated systemwide guest loyalty and commercial platform helps us succeed as one of the largest and most geographically diverse hospitality companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa choice hotels international hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international radisson hotel group and wyndham hotels  resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our hotels and resorts experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms occupancy levels and room rates realized by hotel owners through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result of such fixed costs in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employees minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

as an international manager franchisor owner and lessee of properties in 113  countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals in addition some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the united kingdoms uk bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations the european unions general data protection regulation effective in 2018 has stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data such as credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information that we collect for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes 

environmental matters 

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had laundry and drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of waste that we generate including at locations where such waste has been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise contracts but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and managed properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of any hotel to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of such hotel 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property business interruption terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels and we maintain workers compensation coverage for all of our employees in addition through our captive insurance subsidiary we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels 

corporate responsibility 

the success of our business is linked to the success of our communities – from the local owners who partner with us to build our hotels to the local talent that operate them to the local businesses we support through the products we source and to the guests we serve therefore we work every day to drive positive social and environmental change across our value chain which consists of our operations our supply chain and our communities

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance and results may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location rates for hotel rooms food and beverage and other services property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise contracts   

we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts could be reduced 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and the amount of payments to us for the assets and services we provide them may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable unsustainable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries cyberattacks security breaches natural disasters crime individual guest owner or employee notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity by increasing the speed and expanse of information dissemination many social media platforms publish content immediately and without filtering or verifying the accuracy of that content a negative incident at one hotel could have farreaching effects including lost sales customer boycotts loss of development opportunities and employee difficulties such an incident also could subject us to legal actions including litigation governmental 

investigations or penalties along with the resulting additional adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hospitality industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand for customers compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property while we maintain certain contractual protections repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to develop or buy and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing development pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise contracts as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition use of technology safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2018  we had more than 2400  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our development pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

since 2011 we have launched seven new brands home2 suites by hilton curio collection by hilton canopy by hilton tru by hilton tapestry collection by hilton motto by hilton and most recently lxr hotels  resorts we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states over the past several years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

our investments in owned and leased real property including through joint ventures subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

 

  

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive than anticipated 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists or at all regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other 

third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to us or the other joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we develop own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology systems and services for property management procurement finance human resources reservations distribution and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses third party criminal activity including ransomware or other malware and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloudbased providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation and distribution system relies on data communications networks and systems operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer malware changes in applicable federal state and international regulations security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and our thirdparty service providers experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time and despite our deployment of cyberattack prevention and detection techniques we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents we have in the past been subject to cyberattacks and expect that we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years and may continue to do so breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information for example the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 and replaced the data protection laws of each eu member state requires companies to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data and failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenue we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition us states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our guest loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as thirdparty alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretations of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather 

than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites which increases costs to hotels in our system internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business if that growth continues it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the loyalty members charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with third parties such as airlines other transportation services online vendors retailers and credit card companies to sell honors points for the use of their customers andor to allow honors members to use or exchange points for products or services currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 113  countries and territories around the world our rooms outside the united states represented approximately 27 percent 26 percent and 25 percent of our systemwide rooms for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our results as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from and the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president 

and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to a number of modern slavery human trafficking and forced labor reporting training and due diligence laws in various jurisdictions and expect additional statutory regimes to combat these crimes to be enacted in the future the impact of laws such as the uks modern slavery act 2015 australias modern slavery bill 2018 and frances duty of vigilance law 2017 on hotel operations as well as supply chain could increase costs of operations and reduce profits 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 31 percent  and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 20 percent  of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations and our ability to promote services expected by customers reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage more than 169000  individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to staff and manage the hotels that we manage own and lease could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our 

results of operations and the results of hotels that we manage on behalf of thirdparty owners additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have more than 6200  trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other contracts may not be available to us 

on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange derivatives with financial institutions however these derivatives may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses exists and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry andor we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control such as the natural and manmade disasters that occurred in 2018 could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates we anticipate increased costs of property insurance across the portfolio in 2019 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2018 in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2013 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton honors guest loyalty program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 817 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 14   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations see note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate our 

intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hospitality industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise contract and negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured within certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our spinoffs 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation 

does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spinoffs we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial results 

pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2018  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount was approximately 74 billion and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt for the years ending december 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively were 16 million  17 million  and 18 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with liborbased interest rate derivatives libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 70 to 10 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control 

our common stock is listed on the nyse under the trading symbol hlt the capital and credit markets have on occasion experienced periods of extreme volatility and disruption the market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance in the past securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time 

although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

future issuances of common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or issuance of shares of preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities may dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock because our decision to issue additional equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future issuances also we cannot predict the effect if any of future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sales on the market price of our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 

 

 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

on january 3 2017 we completed the spinoffs of park and hgv the historical financial results of park and hgv are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations see note 3   discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

segments and regions 

management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of two  reportable segments that are based on similar products or services i management and franchise and ii ownership the management and franchise segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our brands this segment generates its revenue from i management and franchise fees charged to thirdparty hotel owners ii license fees for the exclusive right to use certain hilton marks and intellectual property and iii fees for managing our owned and leased hotels as a manager of hotels we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from hotel room sales food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions i the americas ii europe middle east and africa emea and iii asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represented 73  percent of our systemwide hotel rooms as of december 31 2018  therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region overall and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately and as such are presented separately within the analysis herein the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

system growth and pipeline 

our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management or franchise services prior to approving the addition of new properties to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the property based on its geographic 

location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors by increasing the number of management and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners we expect to increase overall return on invested capital and cash available for return to stockholders 

as of december 31 2018  we had more than 2400  hotels in our development pipeline that we expect to add as open hotels in our system representing over   364000  rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 103  countries and territories including 35  countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels all of the rooms in the development pipeline are within our management and franchise segment additionally 195000  rooms in the development pipeline were located outside the us and 184000  rooms or more than half were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

 

 

 

 



sales or usage and covers the costs of i advertising and marketing programs ii internet technology and reservation systems and iii quality assurance program expenses we are contractually required to use these fees solely for the programs 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

 

 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

 

 

 



 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities including those that are intercompany in nature denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at marketbased exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods we hedge foreign exchangebased cash flow variability in certain of our foreign currency denominated management and franchise fees using forward contracts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property depending principally upon their location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported excluding the hotels distributed in the spinoffs and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 5634  hotels in our system as of december 31 2018  4218  hotels have been classified as comparable hotels our 1416  noncomparable hotels included 197  hotels or approximately three percent  of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable average daily rate pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates charged to customers have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room revpar 

revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels as previously described occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted as such comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2018  and comparisons for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2017  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda reflects income loss from continuing operations net of taxes excluding interest expense a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 

adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain items including gains losses revenues and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructurings and retirements iv furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements v reorganization costs vi sharebased compensation expense vii noncash impairment losses viii severance relocation and other expenses ix amortization of contract acquisition costs x the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties and xi other items 

during the first quarter of 2018 we modified the definition of adjusted ebitda to exclude the amortization of contract acquisition costs and the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties we believe that excluding these items is useful for the reasons set forth below and have applied the modified definition of adjusted ebitda to all periods presented 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and the provision for income taxes are dependent on company specifics including among other things capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i ffe replacement reserves to be consistent with the treatment of ffe for owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffe ii sharebased compensation expense as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them iii the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts and iv other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations   

results of operations 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2018  we experienced systemwide revpar growth largely driven by improved adr growth in our international portfolio outpaced growth in the us with particularly strong trends in the europe and asia pacific regions continued strength in europe was driven primarily by increased adr most notably in turkey as it continues to recover from political and economic turmoil growth in asia pacific was primarily attributable to increased occupancy in china resulting from new hotels maturing in our system in the americas excluding us increases in revpar were largely attributable to positive performance in the caribbean and canada driven by increases in adr revpar grew moderately in mea primarily due to increases in occupancy in egypt in the us revpar experienced its ninth consecutive year of growth but was also affected by natural and manmade disasters driving increased occupancy for the year ended december 31 2017 and softening results and comparisons of growth during the year ended december 31 2018 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2017  we experienced revpar growth across all regions particularly in asia pacific europe and the americas excluding us continued growth in asia pacific was primarily driven by high demand in china and japan attributable to new hotels stabilizing in the system resulting in increased occupancy strong performance in europe was a result of increases in both occupancy and adr largely driven by continued recovery from the geopolitical and economic turmoil in 2016 particularly in turkey the revpar increase in the americas excluding us was driven by strong performance in canada and puerto rico which was a result of strong transient and group demand and steady demand resulting from the hurricanes respectively mea experienced revpar growth due to increased occupancy despite declines in adr due to travel sanctions and increased geopolitical pressures revpar growth in the us was driven by increased demand in certain markets as a result of hurricane relief efforts 

the table below provides a reconciliation of income loss from continuing operations net of taxes to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

 

revenues 



the addition of new managed and franchised properties to our system and the increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised hotels yielded increases in management and franchise fees in all periods 

including new development and ownership type transfers we added on a net basis 829 managed and franchised properties from january 1 2017 to december 31 2018 and 744 managed and franchised properties from january 1 2016 to december 31 2017 providing an additional 144149 rooms and 133921 rooms respectively to our management and franchise segment as new hotels stabilize in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods 

franchise and licensing fees increased as a result of increases in revpar at our comparable franchised hotels of 23 percent and 20 percent during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively due to increases in adr of 16 percent and 09 percent respectively as well as increased occupancy of 05 percentage points and 08 percentage points respectively franchise and licensing fees also increased during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 as a result of net increases in licensing and other fees of 112 million and 148 million respectively 

on a comparable basis management fees increased during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 as a result of increases in revpar at our managed hotels of 44 percent and 34 percent respectively due to increased occupancy of 17 percentage points and 24 percentage points respectively and for the year ended december 31 2018 increased adr of 21 percent for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in management fees was partially offset by a decrease in base and other management fees that was the result of termination fees recognized during the year ended december 31 2017 



the changes in owned and leased hotel revenues during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 primarily included an increase of 21 million and a decrease of 41 million respectively resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and on a currency neutral basis increases of 48 million and 41 million respectively related to our comparable owned and leased hotels 

the increases in revenues at our comparable owned and leased hotels were primarily the result of improved performance due to increases in revpar of 53 percent and 48 percent during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively driven by increases in adr of 38 percent and 32 percent respectively and occupancy growth of 11 percentage points and 12 percentage points respectively these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues on a currency neutral basis at our noncomparable owned and leased hotels of which 18 million and 5 million respectively were due to lease terminations and for the year ended december 31 2017 the disposal of a property which were only partially offset by increases in revenues from a property that opened in 2017 



other revenues decreased during the year ended december 31 2018 and increased during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily as a result of 28 million and 9 million of recoveries from the settlement of a claim by hilton to a third party related to our defined benefit plans that were recognized during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease during the year ended december 31 2018 was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our purchasing operations due to increased volume 

operating expenses 



the changes in owned and leased hotel expenses during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 primarily included an increase of 20 million and a decrease of 40 million respectively resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and on a currency neutral basis increases of 51 million and 39 million respectively related to our comparable owned and leased hotels 

the increases in expenses at our comparable owned and leased hotels were primarily due to increased variable operating costs related to occupancy growth and for the year ended december 31 2018 increased contingent rent expense resulting from improved performance the currency neutral increases during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were partially offset by decreases in owned and leased hotel expenses at our noncomparable owned and leased hotels of which 13 million and 6 million respectively were due to lease terminations and for the year ended december 31 2017 the disposal of a property which were only partially offset by increases in expenses from a property that opened in 2017 additionally the changes included a 4 million refund of rent related to a lease termination that was recognized in 2017 



the decreases in depreciation and amortization expenses during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were primarily the result of decreases in amortization expense driven by certain capitalized software costs being fully amortized during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively additionally the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2018 included a 5 million decrease in depreciation expense primarily related to our leased hotels as a result of a lease termination and assets being fully depreciated in 2017 

the increases in general and administrative expenses during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were primarily the result of increases in payroll and compensation costs including sharebased compensation which for the year ended december 31 2017 was largely driven by an increase in retirement eligible participants resulting in the acceleration of expense recognition as well as additional expense recognized from a special equity grant to certain participants in connection with the spinoffs these increases were partially offset by decreases in severance costs related to the 2015 sale and continued management of the waldorf astoria new york of 8 million and 10 million respectively additionally for the year ended december 31 2017 there were 18 million of costs associated with the spinoffs while similar costs for the year ended december 31 2016 were included in discontinued operations 

other expenses decreased during the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of impairment losses and costs for the settlement of the claim relating to our defined benefit plans being recognized during the year ended december 31 2017 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses from our purchasing operations the decrease in other expenses during the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily a result of decreased impairment losses of 11 million 

nonoperating income and expenses 



 

 

the increases in interest expense were primarily due to the issuances of the 4625 senior notes due 2025 the 2025 senior notes and the 4875 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 senior notes in march 2017 and for the year ended december 31 2018 the issuance of the 5125 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 senior notes in april 2018 the increase during the year ended december 31 2017 also related to the issuance of the 4250 senior notes due 2024 in august 2016 and the reclassification of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from interest rate swaps dedesignated in 2016 these increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense due to the march 2017 repayment of the 5625 senior notes due 2021 the 2021 senior notes and the march 2017 refinancing of the senior secured term loan facility the term loans which reduced the interest rate on this borrowing additionally for the year ended december 31 2018 interest expense decreased due to the april 2018 partial repayment of the term loans and the reclassification of gains from accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the interest rate swap settled in 2018 see note 9   debt  and note 11   derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and interest rate swaps respectively 

the net gain and losses on foreign currency transactions for all periods were primarily related to changes in foreign currency rates on our shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans the changes were predominantly related to loans denominated in the australian dollar aud the british pound and the euro eur 

the loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the 2021 senior notes and included a redemption premium of 42 million  and the accelerated recognition of 18 million  of unamortized debt issuance costs during the year ended december 31 2017 

other nonoperating income net decreased during the year ended december 31 2018 and increased during the year ended december 31 2017 due to a 7 million gain that was recognized in 2017 related to an amendment of one of our capital leases additionally for the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of the partial repayments of the term loans in april and december 2018 we accelerated the recognition of deferred financing costs and discount driving a 6 million decrease which was partially offset by a combined 12 million gain related to the refinancing and early repayment of a loan we issued that financed the construction of a hotel that we manage 

on december 22 2017 hr1 known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcj act was signed into law which permanently reduced the corporate income tax rate from a graduated 35 percent to a flat 21 percent rate and imposed a onetime transition tax in 2017 on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred the increase in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2018 was the result of a onetime benefit recorded during the year ended december 31 2017 related to the tcj act as well as an increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes partially offset by the decrease in the annual effective tax rate as a result of the tcj act the income tax benefit during the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to a benefit of 600 million for the estimated impact of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future this benefit was partially offset by an increase in tax expense attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes compared to the year ended december 31 2016 see note 14   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2018  we had total cash and cash equivalents of 484 million  including 81 million  of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our selfinsurance programs 

our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures including costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels corporate expenses payroll and compensation costs taxes and compliance costs interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment our longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment dividends as declared share repurchases and corporate capital and information technology expenditures 

we finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations we believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits taxes and compliance costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity and minimize operational costs further we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases 

we and our affiliates may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise purchases or retirement of debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  we repurchased 235 million and 135 million shares of our common stock for 17 billion and 891 million respectively which we funded with borrowings and available cash 

sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our net cash flows 



 

 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels and for the year ended december 31 2016  sales of timeshare units 

the 406 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily the result of improved operating results from our management and franchise business including net growth in 

properties as well as a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes of 238 million  the increase was partially offset by an increase in contract acquisition costs 

the 461 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily the result of a decrease in operating income from our owned and leased properties and sales of timeshare units as a result of the spinoffs 

investing activities 

for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized software costs our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily consisted of expenditures related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of hotels in our ownership segment which for the year ended december 31 2016  included those hotels owned by park following completion of the spinoffs our capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives for the benefit of both our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations additionally during the year ended december 31 2018  these expenditures were offset by the receipt of the repayment of a loan we issued that financed the construction of a hotel that we manage 

financing activities 

the 424 million  decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily attributable to the transfer of cash in connection with the spinoffs during 2017 and the issuance of the 15 billion 2026 senior notes during the year ended december 31 2018  these decreases were partially offset by the 800 million repayment of the term loans as well as 19 billion of capital returned to our stockholders which includes dividends and share repurchases during the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 11 billion of capital returned during the year ended december 31 2017  

the 1680 million increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily the result of cash transferred in connection with the spinoffs and an increase of 809 million in capital returned to stockholders in addition during the year ended december 31 2017  we received 15 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes and 2027 senior notes which we used with available cash to repay in full our 2021 senior notes including a redemption premium of 42 million 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2018  our total indebtedness e xcluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount  was approximately 74 billion  for additional information on our total indebtedness debt issuances and repayments and guarantees on our debt refer to note 9   debt  and note 23   condensed consolidating guarantor financial information  in our consolidated financial statements 

our senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility provides for 10 billion  in borrowings including the ability to draw up to 150 million in the form of letters of credit as of december 31 2018  we had 63 million  of letters of credit outstanding leaving us with a borrowing capacity of 937 million  the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31 2018  and the majority of them related to our selfinsurance programs subsequent to december 31 2018 we drew a net 100 million  under the revolving credit facility 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures issue additional equity securities or draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  



 

 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2018  was 318 million  this amount is excluded from the table above because these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change refer to note 14   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018  included letters of credit of 63 million  and performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of approximately 36 million  for which we accrued 12 million  as of december 31 2018  for estimated probable exposure additionally we enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels to operate our marketing sales and brand programs these obligations have minimal or no net effect on our future cash flows see note 20   commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations cash flows and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

property and equipment 

we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net carrying value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 367 million  of property and equipment net as of december 31 2018  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

hilton honors 

hilton honors records a point redemption liability for amounts received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay any amounts received from participating hotels and program partners in excess of the actuarial determined cost per point are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized as revenue upon point redemption 

in addition to the hilton honors fees we receive from hotel owners to operate the program we earn fees from cobrand credit card arrangements for the use of our ip license and the issuance of hilton honors points the allocation of the overall fees from the cobrand credit card arrangements between the ip license and the hilton honors points is based on their estimated standalone selling prices the estimated standalone selling price of the ip license is determined using a relieffromroyalty method using statistical formulas based on factors that require significant judgment including estimates of credit card usage an appropriate royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the projected cash flows the estimated standalone selling price of the future reward redemptions under the cobrand credit card arrangements is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis with the same assumptions related to the point redemption liability as discussed above adjusted for an appropriate margin 

as of december 31 2018  we had a 1669 million  liability for guest loyalty program including 700 million  reflected as a current liability and deferred revenues of 471 million  including 186 million  reflected as a current liability changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and deferred revenues 

income taxes 

see note 14   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for discussion on the effects of the tcj act 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized we assume among other items the position will be examined the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position should be based on its technical merits further estimates based on the tax position’s technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which can materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency will be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if an entity in which we hold an interest is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and the fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates or foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into derivative financial instruments intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial instruments to the extent they meet the objectives described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt we are most vulnerable to changes in onemonth libor as the interest rate on our variablerate debt is based on this index we use interest rate swaps in order to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability as of december 31 2018  we held interest rate swaps through which we receive onemonth libor and pay a fixed rate on a portion of the term loans we elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2018  for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk including longterm debt and interest rate swaps for longterm debt the table presents contractual maturities and related weighted average interest rates for the interest rate swaps the table presents the notional amount and weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity date fixed rates are the weighted average actual rates and variable rates are the weighted average market rates prevailing as of december 31 2018  for the interest rate hedges in place 



 

 

refer to note 11   derivative instruments and hedging activities  and note 12   fair value measurements  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value measurements of our derivatives and financial assets and liabilities respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses the value of these revenues and expenses could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities and to our reporting currency usd we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain 

intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2018  our largest net exposures were to aud and eur 

we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our management and franchise fees denominated in certain foreign currencies we use forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to cash balances denominated in foreign currencies refer to note 11   derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value and earnings effect of these forward contracts which we do not consider to be material to our consolidated financial statements

our business 

as of december 31 2017  our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 



we operate our business under a management and franchise segment and an ownership segment for more information regarding our segments see part ii—item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 19   business segments  in part ii—item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

management and franchise 

through our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and license our brands this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management contracts for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management contracts vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee which is based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue and when applicable an incentive management fee which is typically based on a percentage of hotel operating profits in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the hotels gross room revenue or other usage fees which covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs the costs of internet technology and reservation systems and quality assurance program expenses owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2017  we managed 656  hotels with 208235  rooms excluding our owned leased and joint venture hotels 

the initial terms of our management contracts for full service hotels are typically 20 to 30 years  in certain cases when we have entered into a franchise contract in addition to a management contract we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management contracts are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these contracts contain one or two extension options that are for either five or 10 years  and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement in the case of our management contracts with park assuming we exercise all renewal periods the total term of the management contracts will range from 30 to 70 years 

some of our management contracts provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

franchising 

we license our brand names trademarks and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise contracts we do not own manage or operate franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained for new franchised hotels both new construction and conversions of existing hotels from other brands we approve the location as well as the plans for the facilities to ensure the hotels meet our brand standards for existing franchised hotels we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed to keep the hotels in compliance with our brand standards so they can remain in our hotel system occasionally we may have a franchise contract and a management contract in place at the same property in which case we are both the franchisor and the manager of that property we also earn license fees from a license agreement with hgv and cobrand credit card arrangements for the use of certain hilton marks and intellectual property as of december 31 2017  we franchised 4555  properties with 625674  rooms 

each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee in conjunction with the inception of a franchise contract franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross room revenue and in some cases a percentage of food and beverage revenue additionally the franchisees pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the hotels gross room revenue that covers the costs of certain advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems and quality assurance programs among other things that benefit the brand franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors guest loyalty program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services 

our franchise contracts for new construction hotels and our franchise contracts with park typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years our franchise contracts for converted hotels have initial terms of approximately 10 to 20 years  at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years our franchise contracts with park cannot be extended without our consent we have the right to terminate a franchise contract upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise contract is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages 

ownership 

as of december 31 2017  our ownership segment consisted of 73  hotels with 22206  rooms that we owned or leased or that are owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest as a hotel owner we focus on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things maximizing hotel revenues implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we develop and execute on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance their market position and at many of our hotels we invest in renovating guest rooms and public spaces and adding or enhancing meeting and retail space to improve profitability 

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential and resort manager franchisor owner and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor and owner of hotels with an associated systemwide guest loyalty platform helps us succeed as one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group choice hotels international hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international and wyndham worldwide corporation 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our hotels and resorts experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon their location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in the development and supply of and demand for hotel rooms occupancy levels and room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result of such fixed costs in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise contracts and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular jurisdiction 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employees minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

finally as an international owner manager and franchisor of properties in 105  countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws and tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals in addition some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the united kingdoms uk bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of waste that we generate including at locations where such waste has been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise contracts but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and managed properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flow 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements foreign managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise contracts typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of hotels owned by such third parties 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels and we maintain workers compensation coverage for all of our team members in addition through our captive insurance subsidiary we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels 

corporate responsibility 

the success of our business is linked to the success of communities in which our hotels operate  from the local owners who partner with us to build hotels to the local talent that operate the hotels to the local economies and businesses our hotels support through sourcing products serving guests 

travel with purpose our corporate responsibility strategy is a holistic approach that leverages our global footprint and scale coupled with local insights and partnerships to address global and local challenges our strategy was developed by mapping social and environmental issues that are impacted by our business and will continue to be critical to our longterm success we ranked the issues based on our influence and the relative importance to our business operations and stakeholder groups we also engaged with both internal and external stakeholders to identify interests and concerns that should be taken into consideration as we continue to grow we revisited our materiality results in 2015 and based on these results we have identified the priority issue areas for our corporate responsibility efforts and forthcoming goals and targets creating shared value for hotel employees guests owners communities and overall business is a strategic priority we strive to achieve by focusing on advancing three priority material issue areas 

 

lightstay  our proprietary corporate responsibility performance measurement platform is a global brand standard that allows us to manage the impact of our hotels on the environment and global community through the measurement analysis and improvement of our use of natural resources opportunities created and community service this year for the first time hilton was named to the dow jones sustainability index north america as an industry leader across economic social and environmental criteria

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury full service and focused service hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise contracts   

we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts could be reduced 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property while we maintain certain contractual protections repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise contracts as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 2257  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

since 2011 we have opened hotels under five new brands home2 suites by hilton curio  a collection by hilton canopy by hilton tru by hilton and most recently tapestry collection by hilton we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states over the past several years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

our investments in owned and leased real property subject us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

 

  



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property 

as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloudbased providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer malware changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and our thirdparty service providers experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents in november 2015 we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some pointofsale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware we expect we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information for example the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which becomes effective in may 2018 and replaces the current data protection laws of each eu member state requires companies to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data and failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 percent of worldwide revenue we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our guest loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as 

needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as thirdparty alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu gdpr that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to 

renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites which increases costs to hotels in our system internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or transient business rather than group business for meetings and events in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business if that growth continues it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the loyalty members charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with third parties such as airlines other transportation services online vendors retailers and credit card companies to sell honors points for the use of their customers andor to allow honors members to use or exchange points for products or services currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 105  countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 23 percent  28 percent  and 31 percent  of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from and the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be an affiliate of hna or hnas affiliates or blackstone or blackstones affiliates other affiliates of hna or blackstone have in the past or may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 31 percent  and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 15 percent  of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage more than 163000  individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to staff and manage the hotels that we manage own and lease could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have nearly 5900  trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses exists and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry andor we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates such as those natural disasters that occurred in 2017 we anticipate increased costs of property insurance across the portfolio in 2018 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2017 in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2013 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton honors guest loyalty program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 14   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations see note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying 

amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise contract and negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our spinoffs 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffs 

although we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spinoffs has provided financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoffs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits for example if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met by park the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us our stockholders and stockholders of park if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoffs we or the businesses that were spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on our or their business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect 

or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spinoffs we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial results 

pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2017  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts was approximately 67 billion  and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt for the years ending december 31 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively were 54 million  55 million  and 57 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 70 to 10 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives finally our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted by the stockholders agreement we entered into with hgv and certain entities affiliated with blackstone that is intended to preserve the taxfree status of the spinoffs of park and hgv 

  

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

hna which purchased 25 percent of our common stock from blackstone in march 2017 beneficially owned approximately 260 percent  of our common stock as of december 31 2017  as a result of our share repurchases lowering our total number of shares outstanding blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 54 percent  of our common stock as of december 31 2017  moreover under our bylaws and each stockholders’ agreement with hna and blackstone for so long as hna or blackstone as applicable retains specified levels of ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by them thus for so long as hna and blackstone continue to own specified percentages of our stock each will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time each of hna and blackstone may have influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers for example for so long as hna or blackstone continues to own a significant percentage of our stock hna or blackstone may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

each of hna and blackstone and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in the hospitality industry in the ordinary course of their business activities each of hna and blackstone and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders for example hna acquired carlson hotels in december 2016 and owns an interest in nh hotel group blackstone owns interests in la quinta holdings inc and certain other investments in the hospitality industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of hna and blackstone directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate under our stockholders agreement with hna we agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to hna or its affiliates hna or blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition hna or blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their respective investments even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

  

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time

future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

blackstone owned approximately 54 percent  and hna owned approximately 260 percent  of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2017  pursuant to registration rights agreements blackstone and certain management stockholders have and hna will have the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them hna is subject to specified transfer restrictions pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement with us those restrictions are subject to specified exceptions including in connection with margin loan arrangements and any proposed transfers that a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors may approve each of hna and blackstone has pledged 

substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to margin loan arrangements and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 

 

 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

segments and regions 

management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of two  reportable segments that are based on similar products or services i management and franchise and ii ownership the management and franchise segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our brands this segment generates its revenue from i management and franchise fees charged to thirdparty hotel owners ii license fees for the exclusive right to use certain hilton marks and intellectual property and iii affiliate fees charged to owned and leased hotels as a manager of hotels we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions i the americas ii europe middle east and africa emea and iii asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represented 74  percent of our systemwide hotel rooms as of december 31 2017  therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region overall and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately and as such are presented separately within the analysis herein the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

system growth and pipeline 

our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management or franchise services additionally prior to approving the addition of new properties to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the property based on its geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors by increasing the number of management 

and franchise contracts with thirdparty owners we expect to increase overall return on invested capital and cash available for return to stockholders 

as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 2257  hotels in our development pipeline representing approximately   345000  rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 107  countries and territories including 39  countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels all of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment over 182000  of the rooms in the pipeline or more than half were located outside the us additionally over 174000  rooms in the pipeline or more than half were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

 

 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

 

 

 

 



properties the corresponding revenues are presented as other revenues from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income loss or net income loss 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at marketbased exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods we hedge foreign exchangebased cash flow variability in certain of our foreign currency denominated management and franchise fees using forward contracts 

seasonality 

the lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported excluding the hotels distributed in the spinoffs and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which 

comparable results are not available of the 5236  hotels in our system as of december 31 2017  3909  hotels have been classified as comparable hotels our 1327  noncomparable hotels included 284  hotels or approximately five percent  of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable average daily rate levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold for a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room revpar 

revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis unless otherwise noted as such comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2017  and comparisons for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  use the exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2016  

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda reflects income loss from continuing operations net of taxes excluding interest expense a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 

adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain items including gains losses and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructurings and retirements iv furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements v reorganization costs vi sharebased compensation expense vii noncash impairment losses viii severance relocation and other expenses and ix other items 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and the provision for income taxes are dependent on company specifics including among other things our capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i sharebased compensation expense as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them ii ffe replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of ffe for owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffe and iii other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity 

derived in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations   

results of operations 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2017 we experienced revpar growth across all regions particularly in asia pacific europe and the americas excluding us continued growth in asia pacific was primarily driven by high demand in china and japan attributable to new hotels stabilizing in the system resulting in increased occupancy strong performance in europe was a result of both increases in occupancy and adr largely driven by continued recovery from the geopolitical and economic turmoil in 2016 particularly in turkey the revpar increase in the americas excluding us was driven by strong performance in canada and puerto rico which was a result of strong transient and group demand and steady demand resulting from the hurricanes respectively mea experienced revpar growth due to increased occupancy despite declines in adr due to travel sanctions and increased geopolitical pressures revpar growth in the us was driven by increased demand in certain markets as a result of hurricane relief efforts 

the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  were as follows 



the us americas and europe all experienced revpar growth as a result of adr growth with americas excluding us outpacing all other regions driven by strength in canada and mexico the asia pacific increase in revpar was driven by increased occupancy particularly in china mea performance continued to be negatively affected by geopolitical and terrorism concerns resulting in a decrease in occupancy 

the table below provides a reconciliation of income loss from continuing operations net of taxes to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 



 

 

revenues 



the increases in management and franchise fees for all periods were driven by the addition of new managed and franchised properties to our portfolio and the increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised hotels 

including new development and ownership type transfers we added 744 managed and franchised properties from january 1 2016 to december 31 2017 and 600 managed and franchised properties from january 1 2015 to december 31 2016 on a net basis providing an additional 133921 rooms and 89410 rooms respectively to our management and franchise segment the increase from january 1 2016 to december 31 2017 included 67  properties that upon completion of the spinoffs were owned by park and managed or franchised by hilton as new hotels stabilize in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods franchise fees also increased during the year ended december 31 2017 as a result of a net increase in licensing and other fees of 148 million which includes the effect of the license fees earned from hgv after the spinoffs 

on a comparable basis our management fees increased during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 compared to the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result of increases in revpar at our managed hotels of 34 percent and 17 percent respectively primarily due to increased occupancy of 24 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2017 and increased adr of 16 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 on a comparable basis our franchise fees increased as a result of increases in revpar at our franchised hotels of 20 percent and 21 percent respectively primarily due to increases in adr of 09 percent and 20 percent respectively as well as increased occupancy of 08 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2017 



owned and leased hotel revenues decreased during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 as a result of unfavorable foreign currency changes which decreased revenues by 41 million offset by an increase in revenues on a currency neutral basis of 39 million on a currency neutral basis owned and leased hotel revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase at our comparable hotels of 41 million due to an increase in revpar of 48 percent attributable to increases in adr and occupancy of 32 percent and 12 percentage points respectively this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 5 million due to a net disposal of properties between january 1 2016 and december 31 2017 

owned and leased hotel revenues decreased during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of the effect of foreign currency changes and property disposals foreign currency changes accounted for 62 million of the decrease on a currency neutral basis revenues decreased 82 million which was attributable to a net decrease in revenues of 85 million from properties disposed between january 1 2015 and december 31 2016 excluding foreign currency changes and property disposals revenues increased at our comparable owned and leased hotels due to an increase in revpar of 21 percent primarily attributable to an increase in adr of 29 percent 



the increases in other revenues during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 compared to the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively were primarily the result of recoveries of 28 million and 9 million respectively from the settlement of a claim by hilton to a third party relating to our defined benefit plans 

operating expenses 



owned and leased hotel expenses decreased during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily as a result of the effect of foreign currency changes of 40 million on a currency neutral basis owned and leased hotel expenses increased 31 million as a result of an increase of 39 million at our comparable hotels due to increased variable operating costs driven by increased occupancy this increase in owned and leased hotel expenses was partially offset by a decrease at our noncomparable hotels primarily attributable to a decrease of 10 million in expenses due to a net disposal of properties between january 1 2016 and december 31 2017 

owned and leased hotel expenses decreased during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of the effect of foreign currency changes and property disposals foreign currency changes accounted for 65 million of the decrease on a currency neutral basis owned and leased hotel expenses decreased 54 million primarily as a result of the decrease in expenses of 66 million from properties disposed between january 1 2015 and december 31 2016 



the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in amortization expense due to certain capitalized software costs being fully amortized between december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily a result of the recognition of 13 million in accelerated amortization in 2015 on a management contract intangible asset for a property that was managed by us prior to our acquisition of it and its transfer of ownership to park upon completion of the spinoffs 

the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of increased sharebased compensation expense of 29 million mainly due to an increase in retirement eligible participants resulting in the acceleration of expense recognition as well as additional expense recognized from a special equity grant to certain participants in connection with the spinoffs additionally 18 million in costs associated with the spinoffs were incurred during the year ended december 31 2017 while similar costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2016 are included in discontinued operations these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 10 million in severance costs related to the 2015 sale and continued management of the waldorf astoria new york the waldorf astoria new york sale 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease of 73 million in severance costs related to the waldorf astoria new york sale and a decrease in sharebased compensation expense due to 61 million of additional expense recognized during the year ended december 31 2015 when certain remaining awards granted in connection with our initial public offering vested 

the decrease in other expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily a result of decreased impairment losses of 11 million the increase in other expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 related primarily to the consolidation of a management company in 2016 which increased other expenses by 8 million as well as increased impairment losses of 6 million 

gain on sales of assets net 



during the year ended december 31 2016  we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our hotels held by a consolidated vie during the year ended december 31 2015  we recognized a gain upon completion of the sale of the hilton sydney note 4   disposals  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nonoperating income and expenses 



 

 

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily due to the issuances of the 4625 senior notes due 2025 the 2025 senior notes and the 4875 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 senior notes in march 2017 and the 425 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 senior notes in august 2016 as well as the reclassification of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the dedesignation of interest rate swaps in 2016 these increases were largely offset by decreases in interest expense due to the march 2017 repayment of the 5625 senior notes due 2021 the 2021 senior notes and the refinancing of the senior secured term loan facility the term loans in march 2017 which reduced the interest rate on this borrowing 

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to the issuance of the 2024 senior notes partially offset by decreases in interest expense on the term loans due to a reduction of principal from prepayments and an amendment in august 2016 that extended the maturity and reduced the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding balance see note 9   debt  and note 11   derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and interest rate swaps 

  

the net gain and losses on foreign currency transactions for all periods were primarily related to changes in foreign currency rates on our shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans the changes were predominantly related to loans denominated in the australian dollar aud the british pound gbp and the euro for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 as well as the brazilian real for the year ended december 31 2015 

the loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the 2021 senior notes and included a redemption premium of 42 million  and the accelerated recognition of 18 million  of unamortized debt issuance costs during the year ended december 31 2017  

other nonoperating income net increased during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 primarily as a result of a 7 million gain recognized in 2017 related to an amendment of one of our capital leases other nonoperating income net decreased during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of a 24 million gain recognized in 2015 related to a capital lease liability reduction from one of our consolidated vies as well as a pretax gain of 8 million recognized in 2015 on a sale of assets 

on december 22 2017 hr1 known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcj act was signed into law which permanently reduces the corporate income tax rate from a graduated 35 percent to a flat 21 percent rate and imposes a onetime transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred the income tax benefit during the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily due to a benefit of 665 million for the estimated impact of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future the benefit recorded as a result of the provisions of the tcj act represents managements best estimates of the effect to the current period and are subject to refinement and revision over a oneyear period to be finalized in or before december 2018 this benefit was partially offset by an increase in tax expense attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2016 increased compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of two corporate structuring transactions that were effected during the year ended december 31 2016 and included i the organization of hiltons assets and subsidiaries in preparation for the spinoffs and ii a restructuring of hiltons international assets and subsidiaries the international restructuring the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets including intellectual property used in the international business from us subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016 the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated us tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign subsidiaries further our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities our estimated deferred effective tax rate increased in total these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of 482 million during the year ended december 31 2016 see note 14   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

segment results 

we evaluate our business segment operating performance using operating income refer to note 19   business segments  in our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes and additional information on the evaluation of the performance of our segments using operating income the following table sets forth revenues and operating income by segment 



 

 

management and franchise segment revenues and operating income increased for all periods primarily as a result of the net addition of hotels to our managed and franchised system as well as increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 24 percent and 20 percent for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  compared to the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in management and franchise segment revenues and operating income was also due to an increase in licensing and other fees refer to —revenues for further discussion of the increases in revenues from our managed and franchised properties

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2017  we had total cash and cash equivalents of 670 million  including 100 million  of restricted cash and cash equivalents the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our selfinsurance programs 

our known shortterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures including costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels corporate expenses payroll and related benefits legal costs interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment our longterm liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment dividends as declared share repurchases and corporate capital expenditures 

we finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations we believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures including corporate expenses payroll and related benefits legal costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity and minimize operational costs further we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders 

we and our affiliates may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise purchases or retirement of debt if any will depend on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

in february 2017 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 10 billion of the companys common stock and in november 2017 an additional 10 billion was authorized during the year ended december 31 2017  we repurchased 891 million of common stock under the program and as of december 31 2017  1109 million remained available for share repurchases the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 

sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our net cash flows 



 

 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels and for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 sales of timeshare units 

the 441 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily as a result of a decrease in operating income from our owned and leased properties and sales of timeshare units as a result of the spinoffs 

the 81 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily as a result of an increase in net cash paid for income taxes of 202 million partially offset by the improved operating results of our management and franchise segment and hgvs timeshare business 

investing activities 

for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we generated cash from investing activities primarily as a result of net proceeds from the waldorf astoria new york sale completed for the benefit of park and the sale of the hilton sydney of 456 million and 331 million respectively this amount was partially offset by 409 million in capital expenditures for property and equipment contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs 

our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily consisted of expenditures related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of hotels in our ownership segment which for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 included those owned by park following completion of the spinoffs our capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives for 

the benefit of our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations our contract acquisition costs were incurred to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management and franchise contracts with us 

financing activities 

the 1680 million  increase   in net cash used in financing activities   during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016   was primarily the result of cash transferred in connection with the spinoffs   and 11 billion  of capital returned to our stockholders which includes dividends and share repurchases compared to 277 million  in 2016 in addition during the year ended december 31 2017  we received 15 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes which we used with available cash to repay in full our 2021 senior notes including a redemption premium of 42 million 

the 1709 million  decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from borrowings of 4667 million  partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of 2735 million  which were completed in preparation for the spinoffs and an increase in cash dividends of 139 million  the borrowings comprised 4415 million of longterm debt of which 2915 million was for park and 800 million was for hgv we used proceeds from the borrowings and available cash to repay the outstanding balance of parks commercial mortgage backed securities loan of 3418 million 550 million of parks mortgage loans and 250 million on our term loans the increase in cash dividends was due to the declaration of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and continuing quarterly for the full year of 2016 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2017  our total indebtedness e xcluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount  was approximately 67 billion  for further information on our total indebtedness debt issuances and repayments and guarantees on our debt refer to note 9   debt  and note 23   condensed consolidating guarantor financial information  in our consolidated financial statements 

our senior revolving credit facility provides for 10 billion  in borrowings including the ability to draw up to 150 million in the form of letters of credit as of december 31 2017  we ha d   41 million   of letters of credit outstanding leaving us with a borrowin g capacity of 959 million    the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31 2017  and the majority of them related to our selfinsurance programs 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures issue additional equity securities or draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  



 

 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2017  was 283 million  this amount is excluded from the table above because these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could 

change during the next year refer to note 14   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income loss and cash flows 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of   december 31 2017   included letters of credit of   41 million   and performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of approximately   79 million  for which we accrued   21 million   as of   december 31 2017   for estimated probable exposure  see note 20   commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations cash flows and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment annually and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist when using the quantitative process to evaluate goodwill for potential impairment consistent with our early adoption of asu no 201704 in january 2017 we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value when determining the estimated fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units’ cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit 

we had 5190 million  of goodwill as of december 31 2017  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material additionally when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained we use estimates and assumptions similar to those used in our impairment analysis 

brands 

we evaluate our brands intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining the fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm 

growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates 

we had 4890 million  of brands intangible assets as of december 31 2017  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment 

we evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 1342 million  of intangible assets with finite lives and 353 million  of property and equipment net as of december 31 2017  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

hilton honors 

hilton honors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay 

we had a guest loyalty program liability of 1461 million  as of december 31 2017  including 622 million  reflected as a current liability in accounts payable accrued expenses and other changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in a material change to the guest loyalty program liability 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tcj act was signed into law and includes widespread changes to the internal revenue code including among other items a reduction to the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tcj act however where possible we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax in other cases we were not able to make a reasonable estimate and continued to account for those items based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment see note 14   income taxes  for additional discussion on the provisional effects of the tcj act 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized we assume among other items the position will be examined the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position should be based on its technical merits further estimates based on the tax position’s technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if an entity in which we hold an interest is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the process of estimating the fair value of sharebased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant estimates and assumptions made by management refer to note 16   sharebased compensation  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants additionally since we determined that the performance condition for our performance awards is probable of achievement we recognize expense based on anticipated achievement percentages which are based on internallydeveloped projections of future adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of sharebased compensation expense we recognize in future periods 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and the fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates or foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objectives described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt and on our fixedrate debt to the extent that the interest rate affects its fair value we are most vulnerable to changes in onemonth libor as the interest rate on our variablerate debt is based on this index we use interest rate swaps in order to maintain a level of exposure to interest rate variability that we deem acceptable and as of december 31 2017 we held two interest rate swaps which swap onemonth libor on the term loans to fixed rates we elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2017  for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk including longterm debt and interest rate swaps for longterm debt the table presents contractual maturities and related weighted average interest rates for interest rate swaps the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates fixed rates are the weighted average actual rates and variable rates are the weighted average market rates prevailing as of december 31 2017 for the interest rate hedges in place 



 

 

refer to note 11   derivative instruments and hedging activities  and note 12   fair value measurements  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information of the fair value measurements of our derivatives and financial assets and liabilities respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses the value of which could change materially in reference to our reporting currency usd we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2017  our largest net exposures were to the euro gbp and aud 

we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to offset exposure from foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with our euro and yen denominated management and franchise fees we use shortterm foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments to offset exposure to cash balances denominated in foreign currencies however the fair value and earnings effect of these derivatives are not material to our consolidated financial statements

our business 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we operated our business across three segments i ownership ii management and franchise and iii timeshare for more information regarding our segments see part ii—item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 23   business segments  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2016  our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 

 

ownership 

as of december 31 2016 we were one of the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties included a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo and tokyo the portfolio included iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel owners as noted in the overview section on january 3 2017  we completed the spinoff of a portfolio of 67 of our owned and leased hotels and resorts to park in continuation of this strategy these hotels will continue to be a part of the hilton system as managed and franchised properties pursuant to management and franchise agreements entered into in connection with the spinoffs 

as a hotel owner we focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we activated options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use 

management and franchise 

through our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners’ associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel and timeshare management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2016  we managed 559  hotels with 165320  rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties 

the initial terms of our management agreements for full service hotels typically are 20 to 30 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement in the case of our management agreements with park assuming we exercise all renewal periods the total term of the management agreements will range from 30 to 70 years 

some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage as of december 31 2016  we provided management services for 47  timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 141  owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues revenues from our owned and leased hotels are eliminated in our audited consolidated 

financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k following the spinoff of hgv we no longer provide management services to the timeshare properties 

franchising 

we franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2016  we franchised 4175  hotels with 573404  rooms 

each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton honors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services 

our franchise agreements for new construction and our franchise agreements with park typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years and properties that are converted from other brands have initial terms of approximately 10 to 20 years at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owner’s option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years our franchise agreements with park cannot be extended without our consent we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages 

timeshare 

hgv our previously owned timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sources 

 

 

 

hgvs primary product is the marketing and selling of fee simple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity developed either by us or by third parties this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton honors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 4300 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition hgv operates the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2016  hgv managed a global system of 47  resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had nearly 270000 members in total as noted in the overview section on january 3 2017  we completed the spinoff of our timeshare business and these timeshare properties will remain in hiltons system as franchised properties pursuant to a license agreement with hgv 

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor owner and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public and meeting spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and operator of hotels with an associated systemwide customer loyalty platform makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group hongkong and shanghai hotels hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts and wyndham worldwide corporation 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular state and extensive state and federal laws and regulations relating to our timeshare business primarily relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare intervals 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employee minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

finally as an international owner operator and franchisor of hospitality properties in 104  countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws and tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

in addition our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals in addition some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

environmental matters 

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination in addition to our hotel accommodations we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise agreements but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

insurance 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners if not participating in our programs hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements nonus managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs in addition our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of hotels owned by such third parties 

most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume our thirdparty insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsurance retentions or deductible obligations we maintain insurance 

coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels in addition through our captive insurance subsidiary we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles in general our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels 

corporate responsibility 

the success of our business is linked to the success of communities in which our hotels operate  from the local owners who partner with us to build hotels to the local talent that operate the hotels to the local economies and businesses our hotels support through sourcing products serving guests 

travel with purpose our corporate responsibility strategy is a holistic approach that leverages our global footprint and scale coupled with local insights and partnerships to address global and local challenges creating shared value for hotel employees guests owners communities and overall business is a strategic priority we strive to achieve by focusing on advancing three priority material issue areas 

 

lightstay  our proprietary corporate responsibility performance measurement platform is a global brand standard that allows us to manage the impact of our hotels on the environment and global community through the measurement analysis and improvement of our use of natural resources opportunities created and community service

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at our hotels these factors include but are not limited to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury full service and focused service hotels including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise agreements   

we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty property owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements or enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if our thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise agreements as well as our license agreement with hgv require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands which include requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation 

the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 1968  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we launched a new upscale brand tapestry collection by hilton in january 2017 and a new midscale brand tru by hilton in january 2016 we introduced a new brand canopy by hilton in october 2014 opened our first curio  a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 and opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

although we recently completed the spinoff of park we still own or lease real property which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we as the owner or lessee bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the non 

performance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures’ internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton honors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloudbased providers any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents in november 2015 we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some pointofsale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware we expect we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

in addition states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able 

to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we also may divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email and social media marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu general data protection regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our agreements with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel 

intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers or through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guest’s charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton honors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 104  countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 20 percent  and 22 percent  of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone or blackstones affiliates or following blackstones proposed sale of our common stock to hna tourism group co ltd “hna” hna and hnas affiliates other affiliates of blackstone or hna have in the past or may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 30 percent  and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately nine percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage more than 169000  individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to manage and staff the managed owned and leased hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 5700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important 

intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if hgv a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the “program” to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 through december 31 2010 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton honors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them additionally the irs has notified us of its intention to examine the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 through december 31 2013 see note 18   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national 

labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our recent spinoffs 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffs 

although we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spinoffs will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoffs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits for example if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met by park the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us our stockholders and stockholders of park in addition the costs we incur in connection with or as a result of the spinoffs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoffs or if our costs exceed our estimates we or the businesses that were spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on our or their business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the 

requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spinoffs regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request we believe the legislation does not apply to the spinoff of park however no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of park either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spinoffs 

in connection with the spinoffs we park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and as to park management agreements and as to hgv a license agreement certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spinoffs we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements in addition it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future 

in connection with the spinoffs each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties’ assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spinoffs there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spinoffs we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations which could negatively affect our financial results 

pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spinoffs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide park andor hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2016  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts was approximately 109 billion  including 696 million  of timeshare debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and timeshare debt for the years ending december 31 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively were 179 million  110 million  and 543 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 70 to 10 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives finally our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted by the stockholders agreement we entered into with hgv and certain entities affiliated with blackstone that is intended to preserve the taxfree status of the spinoffs of park and hgv 

  

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness including secured debt in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 403 percent  of our common stock as of december 31 2016  hna has agreed to acquire 25 percent of our outstanding common stock from blackstone moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders’ agreement with blackstone for so long as it retains specified levels of ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by blackstone if blackstones proposed sale of our common stock to hna closes hna will have specified board designation rights as described in our current report on form 8k filed on october 24 2016 thus for so long as blackstone and hna continue to own specified percentages of our stock each will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time each of blackstone and hna will have influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers for example for so long as blackstone or hna continues to own a significant percentage of our stock blackstone or hna may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

each of blackstone and hna and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in the hospitality industry in the ordinary course of their business activities each of blackstone and hna and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders for example blackstone owns interests in extended stay america inc la quinta holdings inc park hotels  resorts inc and hilton grand vacations inc and certain other investments in the hospitality industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us hna acquired carlson hotels in december 2016 and has an interest in nh hotel group in addition affiliates of blackstone and hna directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate under the companys stockholders agreement with hna the company agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to hna or its affiliates blackstone or hna also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition blackstone or hna may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their respective investments even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

  

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time 

although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

  

future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock in addition blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to registration rights agreements blackstone and certain management stockholders have and hna will have the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 412 percent  of our outstanding common stock as of 

december 31 2016  these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 

 

 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

recent events 

on january 3 2017  we completed the previously announced spinoffs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as our timeshare business into two independent publicly traded companies park and hgv respectively the spinoffs were completed via a distribution to each of hiltons stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 15 2016 of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of park and hgv each hilton stockholder received one share of park common stock for every five shares of hilton common stock and one share of hgv common stock for every ten shares of hilton common stock both park and hgv have their common stock listed on the nyse under the symbols pk and hgv respectively unless otherwise stated disclosures herein reflect the results of hilton without giving effect to the spinoffs for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  see item 1a risk factors and note 29   subsequent events  in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion refer to pro forma financial information included in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on january 4 2017 for the historical results of operations and performance of hilton giving effect to the spinoffs and refer to the registration statements on form 10 of park and hgv and their subsequent periodic and other reports filed with the sec for their respective historical financial results additionally refer to our press release on our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results for our pro forma financial information for the year ended december 31 2016 included in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on february 15 2017 

on january 3 2017  we completed a 1for3 reverse stock split of hiltons outstanding common stock the authorized number of shares of common stock was reduced from 30000000000 to 10000000000 and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock remains 3000000000 all share and sharerelated information presented in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the reverse stock split

segments and regions 

during the periods covered by this report management analyzed our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions which consisted of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services ownership management and franchise and timeshare the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the timeshare segment consists of 

multiunit vacation ownership properties and generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare intervals owned by us and third parties resort operations and providing consumer financing for the timeshare interests 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it represents a significant portion of our systemwide hotel rooms which was 75  percent as of december 31 2016  therefore the us is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations refer to part i—item 2 properties for the specific properties and respective locations of the properties that were distributed to park in connection with the spinoffs 

system growth and pipeline 

we continue to expand our global footprint and feebased business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor as the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the respective hotel that we contract with to provide management or franchise services additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capital 

as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 1968  hotels in our development pipeline representing approximately   310000  rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 96  countries and territories including 32  countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels over 99 percent of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment of the rooms in the pipeline over 159000  rooms or more than half of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2016  over 157000  rooms representing approximately half  of our development pipeline were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us

profitability measures either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure or because our twotier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee additionally we receive onetime upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts as well as a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs in general the hotel owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses costs we incur in operating the hotel 

 

 

 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affected the revenues we derived from our operations during the periods presented 

 



development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party 

additionally we entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers we relied on these relationships to expand our timeshare interval supply without deploying capital for asset construction 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incurred the following expenses during the periods presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 



and profits this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel the effectiveness of any costcutting efforts is limited by the amount of fixed costs inherent in our business as a result we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues in addition any efforts to reduce costs or to defer or cancel capital improvements could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands also a significant portion of our costs to support our timeshare business relates to direct sales and marketing of these units in periods of decreased demand for timeshare intervals we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profit margins on our timeshare business 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods 

seasonality 

the lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of th e   4875   hotels in our system as of december 31 2016  3740  have been classified as comparable hotels our 1135  noncomparable hotels included 135  properties or approximately three percent  of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 4565 hotels in our system as of december 31 2015  3624 were classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2015  

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

adr 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revpar 

we calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis all periods use the same exchange rates unless otherwise noted 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

for a discussion of our definition of adjusted ebitda see note 23   business segments    in our consolidated financial statements 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with us gaap in addition our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii these measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry additionally these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry for instance interest expense and income tax expense are dependent on company specifics including among other things our capital structure and operating jurisdictions respectively and therefore could vary significantly across companies depreciation and amortization are dependent upon company policies including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used for adjusted ebitda we also exclude items such as i sharebased compensation expense as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them ii furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of ffe for its owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ffe and iii other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations

the following details the changes in revenues at our owned and leased hotels giving effect to foreign currency fx changes and acquired and disposed hotels 



 

 

the increase in comparable us owned and leased hotel revenue during the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily a result of an increase in food and beverage revenue as well as an increase in revpar of 04 percent attributable to an increase in adr of 21 percent largely offset by a decrease in occupancy of 14 percentage points additionally us owned and leased hotel revenue increased in 2016 as a result of increases in revenues from properties acquired in february and june of 2015 net of the decrease in revenues from the waldorf astoria new york which was sold in february 2015 excluding acquisitions and dispositions revenues from noncomparable us owned and leased hotels decreased for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of renovations at one property during 2016

the decrease in revenues at our international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily a result of the effect of fx changes and decreases in revenues from properties disposed of between january 1 2014 and december 31 2015 on a currency neutral basis comparable international owned and leased hotel revenues increased as a result of an increase in revpar of 42 percent which was primarily a result of an increase in transient guest business additionally excluding dispositions and fx changes there was an increase in revenues at our noncomparable international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the completion of large renovation projects at certain hotels which had previously limited the availability of those properties to guests 

management and franchise fees and other 



the increases in management and franchise fees for all periods were driven by increases in revenues from our noncomparable managed and franchised hotels due to the addition of new managed and franchised properties to our portfolio including new development and ownership type transfers from january 1 2015 to december 31 2016  we added 600 managed and franchised properties on a net basis and from january 1 2014 to december 31 2015  we added 501 managed and franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 89410 rooms and 81474 rooms respectively to our managed and franchised segment as new hotels stabilize in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods 

additionally our management and franchise fees increased during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  compared to the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised hotels due to increases in adr during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  revpar increased 17   

percent and 63 percent respectively at our comparable managed hotels and 21 percent and 52 percent respectively at our comparable franchised hotels franchise fees also increased on a currency neutral basis as a result of increases in licensing fees of 16 million and 57 million during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

timeshare 



timeshare sales revenue increased during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  compared to the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of increases in commissions recognized from the sale of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals of 23 million  and 136 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2016 revenue from the sale of owned timeshare intervals increased 15 million due to increased sales volume however during the year ended december 31 2015 sales volume of owned timeshare intervals decreased due to the shift in sales mix toward thirdparty developed interval sales which resulted in a decrease of owned interval sales revenue of 21 million overall timeshare sales volume increased 10 percent and 18 percent respectively during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  as a result of increased tour flow and net volume per guest additionally revenues from our resort operations increased during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  as a result of increases in fees earned related to our hilton grand vacations club including fees generated by new members 

operating expenses

the following details the changes in revenues at our owned and leased hotels giving effect to fx changes and acquired and disposed hotels 



 

 

the increase in operating expenses at our us owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily the result of increases at our comparable hotels due to higher variable operating costs due to increased occupancy operating expenses at our noncomparable us owned and leased hotels increased during the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses from properties acquired in 2015 net of the decrease in operating expenses from properties disposed of in 2015 

the decrease in operating expenses at our international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily a result of the effect of fx changes and decreases in operating expenses from properties disposed of between january 1 2014 and december 31 2015 on a currency neutral basis operating expenses increased at our international comparable owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015  primarily as a result of increases in variable operating costs resulting from increased occupancy additionally excluding dispositions and fx changes the increase in operating expenses at our noncomparable international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31 2015 was consistent with the increase in revenues for these hotels the changes were primarily the result of the completion of large renovation projects at certain hotels in 2015 the renovations limited occupancy and therefore reduced revenues and operating expenses 

timeshare 



timeshare sales expense increased during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  compared to the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively primarily as a result of higher sales and marketing expenses related to increases in sales volume of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals for both periods and in sales volume of owned intervals for the year ended december 31 2016  additionally cost of product related to the reacquisition of owned timeshare inventory for customer upgrades into thirdparty developed properties decreased during the year ended december 31 2016 partially offsetting the increase in sales and marketing expenses and increased during the year ended december 31 2015 contributing to the increase in timeshare sales expense 

depreciation and amortization 



the increases in depreciation expense during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  compared to the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively resulted primarily from the addition of property and equipment related to the properties acquired in 2015 partially offset by decreases as a result of disposed hotels the decrease in amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  and the increase in amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014 were primarily a result of 13 million in accelerated amortization that was recognized in 2015 on a management contract intangible asset for a property that was managed by us prior to our acquisition of it the increase in amortization expense during the year ended december 31 2015  was also related to capitalized software costs placed into service during 2014 and 2015 

general administrative and other 



general and administrative expense was unchanged during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  however there were significant offsetting increases and decreases during the year these included a decrease of 73 million in severance costs related to the sale of the waldorf astoria new york as well as a decrease in sharebased compensation expense due to 66 million of additional expense recognized during the year ended december 31 2015  when certain remaining awards granted in connection with our initial public offering vested the decreases were offset by an increase of 133 million of costs associated with the spinoffs 

the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily a result of the recognition of approximately 95 million in severance costs related to the sale of the waldorf astoria new york and the additional 66 million of sharebased compensation expense recognized during the year as previously discussed the increase was also a result of the reversal of accruals in 2014 related to the termination of a cashbased longterm incentive plan that was replaced with our 2013 omnibus incentive plan resulting in an 18 million reduction in general and administrative expense during the year ended december 31 2014 

gain on sales of assets net 



 

 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our hotels held by a consolidated vie see note 9   consolidated variable interest entities  in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized gains upon completion of the sales of the hilton sydney and the waldorf astoria new york 

nonoperating income and expenses 



the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to the issuance of new debt partially offset by the reduction of principal on certain debt from prepayments and the amendment of our senior secured term loan facility entered into in 2013 the 2013 term loans which extended the maturity and reduced the interest rate see note 12   debt  in our consolidated financial statements for details of our issuances and repayments related to financing transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31 2016 as well as the interest rates for each debt instrument 

the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2015   compared to the   year ended december 31 2014   was primarily as a result of a decrease in our indebtedness due to   debt prepayments of 775 million  on our 2013 term loans during the year which resulted in lower debt principal balances on which interest expense was calculated 



the decrease in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to a 17 million impairment loss for the impairment of one of our investments in affiliates recognized in 2016 

the increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december 31 2015   compared to the   year ended december 31 2014  was primarily due to improved performance at our unconsolidated hotels partially offset by 3 million in equity in earnings included in the year ended december 31 2014 from unconsolidated affiliates that were involved in an equity investments exchange or sold during that year 



 

 the net loss on foreign currency transactions for the years ended   december 31 2016  and 2015  primarily related to changes in foreign currency rates on our shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans predominantly for loans denominated in australian dollar aud euro and gbp during the year ended december 31 2016  and loans denominated in aud brazilian real and gbp during the year ended december 31 2015  the net gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily a result of changes in foreign currency rates on our shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans predominantly those denominated in gbp and aud 



 

 the other loss net for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily related to the writeoff of i 20 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of the full repayment of the commercial mortgagebacked securities loan entered into in 2013 the 2013 cmbs loan and ii 4 million of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the amendment of the 2013 term loans that were not capitalized 

the other loss   net for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily related to 26 million of transaction costs from the acquisition of properties in connection with the tax deferred exchange partially offset by a 24 million gain from the capital lease liability reduction from one of our consolidated vies 

the other gain net for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily related to a pretax gain of 23 million resulting from an equity investments exchange as well as pretax gains of 13 million resulting from the sale of two hotels and a vacant parcel of land 



income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2016  increased compared to the year ended december 31 2015 primarily as a result of two corporate structuring transactions that were effected during the three months ended december 31 2016 and included i the organization of hiltons assets and subsidiaries in preparation for the spinoffs and ii a restructuring of hiltons international assets and subsidiaries the international restructuring the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets including intellectual property used in the international business from us subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016 the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated us tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign jurisdictions further our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities our estimated deferred effective tax rate has increased in total these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of 513 million during the three months ended december 31 2016 see note 18   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

the decrease in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily the result of a 640 million deferred tax benefit resulting from transactions involving the conversion of certain us subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies and the election to disregard certain foreign subsidiaries for us federal income tax purposes this benefit was offset by an increase in tax expense resulting from a 349 million increase in our income before income taxes further income tax expense was affected by the reduction in goodwill in connection with the sales of the waldorf astoria new york and the hilton sydney as well as compensation costs incurred for certain awards granted in connection with our initial public offering for which no tax benefits were recognized

during the year ended december 31 2015 we generated 414 million  in cash from investing activities primarily as a result of net proceeds from the tax deferred exchange of the waldorf astoria new york and the sale of the hilton sydney of 456 million and 331 million respectively this amount was partially offset by 409 million in capital expenditures including contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs

financing activities 

the 1685 million   decrease  in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from borrowings of 4667 million  partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of 2735 million  and an increase in cash dividends of 139 million  the borrowings comprised 4415 million of longterm debt of which 2915 million was for park and 500 million was for hgv and 300 million of additional borrowings under our timeshare financing receivables credit facility the timeshare facility we used proceeds from the borrowings and available cash to repay the outstanding balance of the 2013 cmbs loan of 3418 million 554 million of mortgage loans and 250 million on the 2013 term loans for details of our issuances and repayments related to financing transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31 2016 refer to note 12   debt  in our consolidated financial statements the increase in cash dividends was due to the declaration of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and continuing quarterly for the full year of 2016 

the 639 million  increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings of 302 million an increase of repayments of debt of 200 million and the payment of cash dividends totaling 138 million in 2015 during the year ended december 31 2015 we repaid a 525 million mortgage loan and made 775 million in prepayments on our 2013 term loans while during the year ended december 31 2014 we made prepayments of 10 billion on our 2013 term loans additionally during the year ended december 31 2014 we issued 350 million of notes backed by timeshare financing receivables of which 300 million of the proceeds was used to reduce the outstanding balance on our timeshare facility 

debt and borrowing capacity 

as of december 31 2016  our total indebtedness e xcluding   224 million   of o ur share of debt of our investments in affiliates was approximately 108 billion  including 694 million  of timeshare debt for further information on our total indebtedness debt repayments and guarantees refer to note 12   debt  in our consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to 

reduce capital expenditures issue additional equity securities or draw on our revolving credit facilities our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and timeshare industries that are beyond our control 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2016 we had three senior revolving credit facilities that provided for an aggregate of 22 billion in borrowings including a   10 billion facility to remain with hilton after the spinoffs and a  10 billion facility and a 200 million fa cility for park and hgv respectively to be transferred in connection with the spinoffs these senior revolving credit facilities allowed for up to 230 million to be drawn in the form of letters of credit with 50 million under parks facility 30 million under hgvs facility and 150 million under hiltons facility  as of december 31 2016  we ha d   45 million   of letters of credit outstanding under hiltons facility leaving us with a borrowin g capacity of 955 million and ther e were no letters of credit or borrowings outstanding under park and hgvs facilities for further information on our credit facilities and our guarantors obligations thereunder refer to note 12   debt  in our consolidated financial statements 

in august 2016 we amended the terms of our timeshare facility to increase the borrowing capacity from 300 million to 450 million allowing us to borrow up to the maximum amount until august 2018 and requiring all amounts borrowed to be repaid by august 2019 in december 2016 we borrowed an additional 300 million bringing our outstanding borrowings under the timeshare facility to 450 million  as of december 31 2016  

letters of credit 

we had a total of   45 million   in letters   of credit outstanding as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the majority of which were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities and related to our guarantees on debt and other obligations of third parties and selfinsurance programs the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31 2016  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  



 

 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2016  was 253 million  these amounts are excluded from the table above because they are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next year refer to note 18   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income and cash flow 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of   december 31 2016   included letters of credit of   45 million  guarantees of   5 million   for debt and obligations of third parties performance guarantees with possible cash outlays totaling approximately   69 million  of which we have accrued   28 million   as of   december 31 2016   for estimated probable exposure and construction contract commitments of approximately   43 million   for capital expenditures at our owned leased and consolidated vie hotels our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some  portion of the work if cancellation of a contract occurred our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract see note 24   commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives 

we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment losses 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 8930 million  of property and equipment net and 1526 million  of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2016  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

investments in affiliates 

we evaluate our investments in affiliates for potential impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own or lease hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investment’s fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include internallydeveloped discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above if an investment’s fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations 

we had 114 million  of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2016  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23   business segments  in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we 

compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value when determining estimated fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units’ cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 

we had 5822 million  of goodwill as of december 31 2016  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material additionally when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained we use estimates and assumptions similar to that of those used in our impairment analysis 

brands 

we evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brand’s estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses 

we had 4848 million  of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2016  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

hilton honors 

hilton honors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay 

we had 1432 million  of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2016  including 543 million  in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates 

we had 120 million  of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2016  changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions refer to note 20   sharebased compensation  in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt interest rates on our variablerate debt discussed below are based on onemonth and threemonth libor so we are most vulnerable to changes in these rates 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2016  for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk 



 

 

refer to note 16   fair value measurements  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international owned and leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses and capital expenditures the value of which could change materially in reference to our reporting currency the us dollar we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2016  our largest net exposures were to the euro gbp and aud as of december 31 2016  we held 68  shortterm foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of 326 million  these offset exposure to financial assets and liabilities and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes

we have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use 

management and franchise 

through our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners’ associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel and timeshare management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services as of december 31 2015  we managed 544  hotels with 158848  rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties 

the initial terms of our management agreements for full service hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement 

some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage as of december 31 2015  we provided management services for 45  timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 146  owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues revenues from our owned and leased hotels are eliminated in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

franchising 

we franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2015  we franchised 3875  hotels with 533039  rooms 

each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services 

our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owner’s option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages 

timeshare 

our timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sources 

 

 

 

hgvs primary product is the marketing and selling of feesimple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity developed either by us or by third parties this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2015  hgv managed a global system of 45  resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had nearly 250000 members in total 

traditionally timeshare operators have funded 100 percent of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties in 2010 we began sourcing timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers these agreements enable us to generate fees from the sales and marketing of the timeshare intervals and club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction costs in addition we source intervals by acquiring units in thirdparty developed properties which requires less capital than constructing timeshare properties our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 114000  or 85 

percent  of our total supply as of december 31 2015  and the percentage of sales of timeshare intervals developed by third parties was 66 percent  for the year ended december 31 2015  

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor owner and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and operator of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels  resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporation 

in the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our primary competitors in the timeshare space include diamond resorts international hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular state and extensive state and federal laws and regulations relating to our timeshare business primarily relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare intervals 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employee minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

finally as an international owner operator and franchisor of hospitality properties in 100  countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

environmental matters 

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination in addition to our hotel accommodations we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise agreements but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned hotels most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks these policies provide 

coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsured retentions or deductibles our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners or if not participating must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements nonus managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs all other insurance programs purchased by hotel owners must meet our requirements in addition our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of hotels owned by such third parties

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at properties that we manage franchise own lease or develop as well as demand for timeshare properties these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury full service and focused service hotels and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators home and apartment sharing services and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and 

redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater commercial financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer 

competition for management and franchise agreements   

we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 

competition for timeshare sales 

we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange their owned interval for use of other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected 

  

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our managed owned leased or timeshare properties can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the recent expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

our management and franchise business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty hotel owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our management and franchise business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio 

if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a hotel owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

we own or lease a substantial amount of real property which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

  

 

 16 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures’ internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

our timeshare business is subject to risks associated with regulation thirdparty owners and providing financing to purchasers 

the timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation 

we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition because we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and also service the resulting loans as well as the loans on inventory sold by thirdparty developers for which we provide marketing services we are subject to various federal and state regulations including those requiring disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may be unable to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas which could result in a decline in timeshare revenues 

  

a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

in addition to timeshare interval supply from our owned timeshare properties we source interval supply through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval supply available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval supply could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management loan and collection services to the timeshare properties 

if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 1082 million  of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 1616  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we launched a new midscale brand tru by hilton in january 2016 we introduced a new brand canopy by hilton in october 2014 opened our first curio  a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 and opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we move production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of 

these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents in november 2015 we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some pointofsale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware we expect we will be subject to additional cyberattacks in the future and may experience data breaches 

 even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other costs or liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

 in addition states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states’ implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems search engines and peertopeer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business if these bookings increase certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by deranking our hotels in search results on their platforms and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels although our agreements with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online by telephone to our call centers or through devices via our mobile application or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guest’s charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 100  countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 22 percent  and 25 percent  of our revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under 

the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners significant customers joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 31 percent  and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 11 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage approximately 164000  individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to manage and staff the managed owned and leased hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 5100 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the “program” to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 through december 31 2010 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 874 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 18   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital 

expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our proposed spinoffs 

the proposed spinoffs of our ownership business and timeshare business are contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management and may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not they are completed 

on february 26 2016 we announced a plan to pursue a separation of a substantial portion of our ownership business consisting primarily of our owned hotels located in the us the ownership business and our timeshare business into separate publiclytraded companies through spinoffs the proposed spinoffs are subject to customary conditions including but not limited to the receipt of opinions concerning the taxfree nature of the transactions and the qualification of the entity holding the ownership business as a real estate investment trust a reit for us federal income tax purposes effectiveness 

of appropriate filings with the securities and exchange commission and final approval by our board of directors in addition ability to execute the transaction as intended unanticipated developments or changes in the macroeconomic environment credit markets and equity markets as well as other market conditions may affect our proposed spinoffs for these and other reasons we may not complete the spinoffs as expected or at all 

whether or not we complete the spinoffs our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the spinoffs including among others the following 

  

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the price of our common stock 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoffs 

although we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spinoffs will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders the spinoffs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits for example if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us and our stockholders in addition we will incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoffs including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the spunoff businesses will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spinoffs or if our costs exceed our estimates the company or the businesses that are spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on their business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if the proposed spinoffs of our ownership business and our timeshare business are completed the trading price of our common stock will decline 

we expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following the spinoffs which will only represent the value of our remaining management and franchise business to be lower than immediately prior to the spinoffs because the trading price for our common stock will no longer reflect the value of our ownership business and our timeshare business 

following the spinoffs the aggregate value of your common stock of the company and the businesses that are spun off may be less than the aggregate value at which the companys common stock might have traded had the spinoffs not occurred 

the common stock of the company and the businesses that are spun off that you may hold following the spinoffs may collectively trade at an aggregate value less than the value at which the companys common stock might have traded had the spinoffs not occurred due to among other factors the expected or actual future performance of either the company or the businesses that are spun off as separate independent companies and the future stockholder base and market for the companys common stock and the shares of the businesses that are spun off 

the proposed spinoffs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

the spinoffs are conditioned on an opinion of tax counsel regarding the qualification of the spinoffs as taxfree distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us further the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spinoffs under section 355 of the code and will not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied moreover if 

any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling is based is incorrect or untrue in any material respect or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling is based are materially different from the facts that prevail at the time of the spinoffs the private letter ruling could be invalidated the opinion will similarly rely on among other things the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spunoff companies and us which if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail additionally recently enacted legislation denies taxfree treatment to a spinoff in which either the distributing corporation or the spunoff corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spunoff corporation from electing reit status for a 10year period following a taxfree spinoff under an effective date provision the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7 2015 because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution will be considered to have been described in that initial request we believe the legislation will not apply to the spinoff of our ownership business however no ruling will be obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard in particular the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spinoffs if the legislation applied to the spinoff of our ownership business either the spinoff would not qualify for taxfree treatment or the entity holding the ownership business would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10year period following the spinoff 

if the spinoffs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoffs were taxable each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new spinoff companies would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2015  our total indebtedness was approximately 105 billion  including 726 million  of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively were 227 million  285 million  and 3493 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries’ mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

  

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

blackstones interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 459 percent  of our common stock as of december 31 2015  moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders’ agreement with blackstone for so long as it retains specified levels of ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by blackstone thus for so long as blackstone continues to own specified percentages of our stock it will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time blackstone will have influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as blackstone continues to own a significant percentage of our stock it may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

blackstone and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities blackstone and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example blackstone owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta holdings inc and certain other investments in the hotel industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of blackstone directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

  

we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules however we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a oneyear transition period as a result our stockholders do not yet have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to those requirements 

until may 2015 blackstone controlled a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we were a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards and has one year following ceasing to be a controlled company to comply with all of nyse’s corporate governance standards 

because of these nyse transition rules for companies that cease to be controlled companies we are not required to have our nominating and corporate governance committee consist entirely of independent directors until may 2016 we intend to continue to utilize the nyses transition period for companies that are no longer controlled companies accordingly our stockholders do not yet have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we may change our dividend policy at any time 

our board of directors declared our first quarterly dividend in july 2015 although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock we have no obligation to do so and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs limitations imposed by our indebtedness legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

  

  

future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock in addition blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to a registration rights agreement blackstone and certain management stockholders have the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 467 percent of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2015  these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

in addition as of december 31 2015  we had 9251754 shares of common stock to be issued upon vesting or exercise of outstanding equitybased awards and an aggregate of 68627645  shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2013 omnibus incentive plan we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2013 omnibus incentive plan accordingly shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 34 

undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

 

 

   

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our business 

hilton is   one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world with 4610  hotels resorts and timeshare properties comprising 758502  rooms in 100  countries and territories as of december 31 2015  our flagship full service hilton hotels  resorts brand is the most recognized hotel brand in the world our premier brand portfolio includes our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands waldorf astoria hotels  resorts conrad hotels  resorts and canopy by hilton our full service hotel brands hilton hotels  resorts curio  a collection by hilton doubletree by hilton and embassy suites by hilton our focused service hotel brands hilton garden inn hampton by hilton tru by hilton homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton and our timeshare brand hilton grand vacations as of december 31 2015  we owned or leased interests in 146  hotels many of which are located in global gateway cities including iconic properties such as the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane we had approximately 51 million  members in our awardwinning customer loyalty program hilton hhonors as of december 31 2015  

segments and regions 

management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services ownership management and franchise and timeshare the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the timeshare segment consists of multiunit vacation ownership properties and generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare intervals owned by us and third parties resort operations and providing consumer financing for the timeshare interests 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 75  percent of our systemwide hotel rooms were located in the us we expect that the percentage of our hotel rooms outside the us will continue to increase in future years as hotels in our pipeline open 

system growth and pipeline 

we continue to expand our global footprint feebased business and the capital efficiency of our timeshare business as we enter into new management and franchise contracts we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor as the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the thirdparty owner of the respective hotel additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capital 

as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 1616  hotels in our development pipeline representing over   266000  rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 85  countries and territories including 31  countries and territories 

where we do not currently have any open hotels all of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment of the rooms in the pipeline approximately 142000  rooms or more than half  of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2015  approximately 134000  rooms representing over half  of our development pipeline were under construction we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us 

our overall supply of timeshare intervals as of december 31 2015  was approximately 134000  intervals or over six  years at current sales pace additionally we enter into agreements to sell timeshare units developed by third parties our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 114000  or 85 percent  of our total supply as of december 31 2015  

recent events 

in january 2016 we launched our newest brand tru by hilton which is a midscale brand tru by hilton embraces the valueconscious traveler offering a backtobasics experience each property will include lively social spaces in a large first floor lobby with a work play and eat zone all with a unique personality as of february 16 2016  tru by hilton had commitments for 163  properties the first property is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2016 

in february 2016 we announced a plan to separate a substantial portion of our ownership business consisting primarily of our owned hotels located in the us as well as our timeshare business from hilton worldwide to form two additional new publicly traded companies see item 1a risk factors and note 29 subsequent events in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion 

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

 

 

 

 46 

revenues and other revenues where applicable in addition to the franchise application and royalty fees franchisees also generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the cost of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation system expenses and quality assurance program costs we also earn fees when certain franchise agreements are terminated early or there is a change in ownership 

 

 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

 

 

additionally in recent years we have entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers we expect the sales of timeshare intervals developed by third parties and resort operations to comprise a growing percentage of our timeshare revenue and revenues derived from the sale of timeshare intervals developed by us to comprise a smaller percentage of our timeshare revenue in future periods consistent with our strategy to focus our business on the management aspects and deploy less of our capital to asset construction 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the united states us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods 

seasonality 

the lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4565  hotels in our system as of december 31 2015  3624  have been classified as comparable hotels our 941   noncomparable hotels included 137  properties or approximately three percent  of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the last year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption underwent largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 4278 hotels in our system as of december 31 2014  3514 were classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2014  

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room 

we calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis all periods use the same exchange rates unless otherwise noted

operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities is primarily generated from management and franchise revenues operating income from our owned and leased properties and sales of timeshare intervals in a recessionary market we may experience significant declines in travel and thus declines in demand for our hotel and resort rooms and timeshare intervals a decline in demand could have a material effect on our cash flow from operating activities 

the 28 million   increase  in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily as a result of improved operating results in each of our three business segments as well as a decrease in cash paid for interest of 29 million offset by an increase in net cash paid for income taxes of 46 million 

the 735 million   decrease  in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  was attributable to an increase in cash paid for taxes of 196 million during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due to higher taxable income in 2014 as well as a decrease in deferred revenues as of december 31 2014 in 2013 we collected 650 million from the sales of hilton hhonors points most of which was deferred revenue as of december 31 2013 these were offset by a decrease in cash paid for interest of 21 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and other favorable timing differences in cash generated from operating activities

financing activities 

the 654 million   increase  in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily attributable to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings of 302 million an increase of repayments of debt of 200 million and the payment of cash dividends totaling 138 million in 2015 the changes in borrowings and repayments of debt were primarily due to the repayment of the waldorf astoria loan of 525 million in connection with the sale of the waldorf astoria new york as well as 775 million of prepayments on our term loans including a 350 million prepayment using the net proceeds from the sale of the hilton sydney during the year ended december 31 2015  comparatively during the year ended december 31 2014  we issued 350 million of securitized timeshare debt of which 300 million of proceeds was used to reduce our outstanding balance on the timeshare facility combined with prepayments on our term loans of 10 billion 

net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2014   decreased   793 million  compared to the year ended december 31 2013  due to a decrease in net repayments of debt of 2041 million the higher net repayments of debt in 2013 was primarily due to a debt refinancing additionally in december 2013 we received 1243 million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock from our ipo

we had a total of 45 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the majority of which were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and related to our guarantees on debt and other obligations of third parties and selfinsurance programs the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31 2015  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  



 

 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2015  was 407 million  these amounts are excluded from the table above because they are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next year refer to note 18   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income and cash flow 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  included letters of credit of 45 million  guarantees of 25 million  for debt and obligations of third parties performance guarantees with possible cash outlays totaling approximately 83 million  of which we have accrued 33 million  as of december 31 2015  for estimated probable exposure and construction contract commitments of approximately 56 million  for capital expenditures at our owned leased and consolidated vie hotels our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work if cancellation of a contract occurred our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract additionally during 2010 in conjunction with a lawsuit settlement an affiliate of blackstone entered into service contracts with the plaintiff as part of the settlement we entered into a guarantee with the plaintiff to pay any shortfall that this affiliate does not fund related to those service contracts the remaining potential exposure under this guarantee as of december 31 2015  was approximately 22 million  see note 24   commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these amounts 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives 

we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment losses 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 9119 million  of property and equipment net and 1735 million  of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2015  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any property and equipment with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows would result in additional impairment losses we did not identify any intangible assets with finite lives for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows projected operating results or other significant assumptions would result in impairment losses 

investments in affiliates 

we evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investment’s fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investment’s fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations 

our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own or lease hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above if there are indicators of potential impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above 

we had 138 million  of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2015  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment losses 

business combinations 

property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to land buildings and leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected future cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit price when evaluating the fair value of our assets changes to these factors could affect the measurement and allocation of fair value other assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date 

goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23   business segments  in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we evaluate the fair value of our reporting units quantitatively when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units’ cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure 

for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 

we had 5887 million  of goodwill as of december 31 2015  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each reporting units by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of our reporting units additionally when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained we use estimates and assumptions similar to that of those used in our impairment analysis 

brands 

we evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models for hotels that we manage or franchise under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brand’s estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses 

we had 4919 million  of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2015  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each of our brands by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of the brand intangible assets 

hilton hhonors 

hilton hhonors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay 

we had 1278 million  of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2015  including 494 million  in current liabilities changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability a 10 percent decrease to the breakage estimate used in determining future award redemption obligations would increase our guest loyalty liability by approximately 53 million 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates 

we had 106 million  of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2015  changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance a 10 percent increase to our default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for loan losses by approximately 43 million 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the morelikelythannot designation changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions refer to note 20   sharebased compensation  in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt interest rates on our variablerate debt discussed below are based on onemonth and threemonth libor so we are most vulnerable to changes in this rate 

under the terms of the cmbs loan we are required to hedge interest rate risk using derivative instruments as such we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the variablerate component or 862 million  which caps onemonth libor at 69 percent  and expires in november 2016 in conjunction with the bonnet creek loan we entered into 

one  interest rate cap in the notional amount of 338 million  that expires in may 2016 and caps onemonth libor at 30 percent  as of december 31 2015 the fair value of these interest rate caps were immaterial to our consolidated balance sheet 

additionally in october 2013 we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of 145 billion  with a term of five years which swapped the floating threemonth libor on a portion of the term loans to a fixed rate of 187 percent  the fair value of these four interest rate swaps was 15 million  and included in other liabilities in our balance sheet as of december 31 2015  

refer to note 15   derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the derivative instruments 

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2015  for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk 



 

 

refer to note 16   fair value measurements  in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our principal exposure results from management and franchise fees earned in foreign currencies and revenues from our international owned and leased hotels partially offset by foreign operating expenses and capital expenditures the value of which could change materially in reference to our reporting currency the us dollar we also have exposure from our international financial assets and liabilities including certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested the value of which could change materially in reference to the functional currencies of the exposed entities as of december 31 2015 our largest net exposures were to the euro british pound singapore dollar canadian dollar and australian dollar as of december 31 2015 we held 35  shortterm foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of 144 million  these offset exposure to financial assets and liabilities and are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes

our businesses 

we operate our business across three segments 1 management and franchise 2 ownership and 3 timeshare for more information regarding our segments see part ii—item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 24  business segments in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2014  our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 

 

management and franchise 

through our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners’ associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel and timeshare management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of each hotel’s gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs as of december 31 2014  we managed 526  hotels with 153634  rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels 

the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement 

some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage as of december 31 2014  we provided management services for 44  timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 144  owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues 

franchising 

we franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained and consult with franchisees concerning certain aspects of hotel operations we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2014  there were 3608  franchised hotels with 495680  rooms 

each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services 

our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owner’s option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages 

ownership 

we are one of the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo sydney and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel owners 

we have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use an example of this is the april 2014 sale of a previously nonincome producing parcel of land at the hilton hawaiian village that had previously been used as a loading dock along with corresponding entitlements in connection with a planned timeshare development project that will not require any capital investment by us further we have plans at the hilton new york to redevelop the hotel’s retail platform to include over 10000 square feet of streetlevel retail space and convert certain floors to timeshare units which we expect will increase the value of the property additionally in february 2015 we completed the sale of the waldorf astoria new york for 195 billion and have entered into a management agreement with the buyer for a 100year term we used the proceeds from the sale of the waldorf astoria new york to acquire five properties for a total purchase price of 176 billion  

timeshare 

our timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sources 

 

 

 

hgvs primary product is the marketing and selling of feesimple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity developed either by us or by third parties this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2014  hgv managed a global system of 44  resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had more than 229000 members in total 

traditionally timeshare operators have funded 100 percent of the investment necessary to acquire land and construct timeshare properties in 2010 we began sourcing timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers these agreements enable us to generate fees from the sales and marketing of the timeshare intervals and club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction 

costs our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 109000  or 82 percent  of our total supply as of december 31 2014 and the percentage of sales of timeshare intervals developed by third parties was 59 percent  for the year ended december 31 2014 

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded manager franchisor owner and operator of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group fairmont raffles hotels international hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels  resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporation 

in the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our primary competitors in the timeshare space include hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide corp starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular state and extensive state and federal laws and regulations relating to our timeshare business primarily relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare intervals 

in addition a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants including safety and health standards as well as the sale of liquor at such properties by requiring licensing registration disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws including with respect to their employee minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and work permit requirements compliance with or changes in these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations 

we also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions 

finally as an international owner operator and franchisor of hospitality properties in 94  countries and territories we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate including employment laws and practices privacy laws tax laws which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the us and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences 

environmental matters 

we are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal in addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws we may also face personal injury property damage fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination in addition to our hotel accommodations we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties we use and store hazardous and toxic substances such as cleaning materials pool chemicals heating oil and fuel for backup generators at some of our facilities and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations some of our properties include older buildings and some may have or may historically have had drycleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and backup generators we have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal in some cases we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination or pursuant to our management or franchise agreements but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems from time to time we may also be required to manage abate remove or contain mold lead asbestoscontaining materials radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties we have implemented an ongoing operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate although we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur costs relating to the investigation identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties those costs have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned hotels most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks these policies provide 

coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsured retentions or deductibles our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels 

us hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners or if not participating must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements us franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements nonus managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs all other insurance programs purchased by hotel owners must meet our requirements in addition our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design development and operation of our hotels

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks related to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at properties that we manage franchise own lease or develop as well as demand for timeshare properties these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice hotels and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively 

competition for management and franchise agreements   

we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 

competition for timeshare sales 

we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected 

  

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and their ability to make payments to us may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events at our managed owned leased or timeshare properties can harm our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the recent expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity we also could face legal claims related to negative events along with resulting adverse publicity if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

our management and franchise business is subject to risks related to doing business with thirdparty hotel owners that could adversely affect our reputation operational results or prospects for growth 

unless we maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements although our management and franchise contracts are typically longterm arrangements hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry 

including factors outside of our control in addition negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

growth of our management and franchise business is affected and may potentially be limited by factors influencing real estate development generally including site availability financing planning zoning and other local approvals in addition market factors such as projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure if not managed effectively by our thirdparty owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of our thirdparty property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development purchase or refinancing if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels as well as result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline 

if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards guest preference for our brands could diminish in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements any dispute with a hotel owner could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

we own or lease a substantial amount of real property which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we have investments in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could adversely affect our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event that our coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of a coventurers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed 

preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures’ internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments 

our timeshare business is subject to risks associated with regulation thirdparty owners and providing financing to purchasers 

the timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation 

we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition because we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and also service the resulting loans as well as the loans on inventory sold by thirdparty developers for which we provide marketing services we are subject to various federal and state regulations including those requiring disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may be unable to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas which could result in a decline in timeshare revenues 

  

a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

in addition to timeshare interval supply from our owned timeshare properties we source interval supply through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval supply available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval supply could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management loan and collection services to the timeshare properties 

if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 1024 million  of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 1351  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases the owners or developers ability to obtain adequate financing obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result our entire development pipeline may not develop into new hotels that enter our system 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we introduced our newest brand canopy by hilton in october 2014 opened our first curio  a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 and launched the eforea spa at hilton brand in 2010 we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation distribution and financial systems substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we move production operations to our disaster recovery site damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential 

problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents for example in 2011 we were notified by epsilon our database marketing vendor that we were among a group of companies served by epsilon that were affected by a data breach that resulted in an unauthorized third party gaining access to epsilon’s files that included names and emails of certain of our customers since this notification we have been subject to additional cyberattacks and data breaches 

 even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years breaches thefts losses or fraudulent uses of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business 

we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal data and other sensitive information 

we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including those related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information we collect internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation reputational harm or other expenses or other adverse effects on our business due to failure to protect our guests personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards 

 in addition states and the federal government have recently enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and failure 

on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon sales of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states’ implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems if these bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees although our agreements with many of these intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites internet travel intermediaries also have recently been subject to regulatory scrutiny particularly in europe the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels 

in addition although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business they have recently expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business consolidation of internet travel intermediaries and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels cost of sales 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online or by telephone to our call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guest’s charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 94  countries and territories around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 25  percent of our revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners employees and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require secreporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 30  percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately nine percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

  

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees we employ or manage approximately 157000  individuals at our managed owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled individuals our ability to manage and staff the managed owned and leased hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 4900 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services plus at any given time a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use this intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 25 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions however these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism risk insurance program the “program” to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized with some adjustments to its provisions in january 2015 for six years through december 31 2020 we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020 or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 and october 24 2007 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 696 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them additionally during 2014 the irs commenced its audit of tax years december 2007 through 2010 see note 19   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted additionally in 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised exposure draft outlining proposed 

changes to current lease accounting in fasb accounting standards codification topic 840 leases  the proposed accounting standards update if ultimately adopted in its current form could result in significant changes to current accounting including the capitalization of leases on the balance sheet that currently are recorded offbalance sheet as operating leases while this change would not affect the cash flow related to our leased hotels and other leased assets it could adversely affect our balance sheet and could therefore affect our ability to raise financing from banks or other sources 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing our relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions status and citizenship requirements in addition the national labor relations board may revise its standard for joint employee relationships which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada under the terms of the settlement until march 2015 we must ensure compliance with ada regulations at our owned and joint venture in which we own more than a 50 percent interest properties built after january 26 1993 require owners of managed or franchised hotels built after january 26 1993 that enter into a new management or franchise agreement experience a change in ownership or renew or extend a management or franchise agreement to conduct a survey of its facilities and to certify that the hotel complies with the ada ensure that new hotels constructed in our system are compliant with ada regulations provide ada training to our employees improve the accessibility of our websites and reservations system for individuals with disabilities appoint a national ada compliance officer and appoint an ada contact onsite at each hotel if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada and our related consent decree we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects which could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2014  our total indebtedness was approximately 117 billion  including 879 million  of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively were 136 million  238 million  and 355 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 percent of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries’ mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future 

indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

  

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

our sponsor and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 553 percent of our common stock as of february 9 2015 moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders’ agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates for so long as our existing owners and their affiliates retain significant ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the sponsor directors even when our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly during that period of time our sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example our sponsor owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta holdings inc and certain other investments in the hotel industry that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of our sponsor directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any 

nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

  

we are a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to those requirements 

affiliates of our sponsor control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we are a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards such as requirements that within one year of the date of nyse listing a company have 

 

 

 

we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition although we have a fully independent audit committee and have independent director representation on our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize these controlled company exemptions accordingly our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

  

because we do not currently pay any cash dividends on our common stock you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than what you paid for it 

we do not currently pay any cash dividends on our common stock the declaration amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by our senior secured credit facility and our senior notes and may be limited by covenants of other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than what you paid for it 

future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by our preipo investors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock after the expiration or earlier waiver or termination of the lockup period described below substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be available for resale in the public market registration of the sale of these shares of our common stock would permit their sale into the market immediately the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them in addition our sponsor has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock 

pursuant to a registration rights agreement we have granted our sponsor and certain management stockholders the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 561 percent of our outstanding common stock as of 

february 9 2015 these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

former members of hilton global holdings llc hgh including our sponsor who received in the aggregate approximately 829481530 shares of our common stock from hgh in connection with our initial public offering are currently prohibited from transferring one third of the shares they received approximately 276493843 shares until june 11 2015 however these transfer restrictions are subject to certain exceptions and may be waived modified or amended at any time as restrictions on resale end the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities 

as of february 9 2015 we had 7197925 of equitybased awards to be issued upon vesting or exercise of outstanding options and an aggregate of 72792531 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2013 omnibus incentive plan we filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2013 omnibus incentive plan accordingly shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 

 

 

   

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our business 

hilton is   one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world with 4322  hotels resorts and timeshare properties comprising 715062  rooms in 94  countries and territories as of december 31 2014  our flagship fullservice hilton hotels  resorts brand is the most recognized hotel brand in the world our premier brand portfolio also includes our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands waldorf astoria hotels  resorts conrad hotels  resorts and canopy by hilton our fullservice hotel brands hilton hotels  resorts curio  a collection by hilton doubletree by hilton and embassy suites hotels our focusedservice hotel brands hilton garden inn hampton hotels homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton and our timeshare brand hilton grand vacations we own or lease interests in 144  hotels many of which are located in global gateway cities including iconic properties such as the hilton new york hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane we have approximately 44 million  members in our awardwinning customer loyalty program hilton hhonors 

segments and regions 

management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services management and franchise ownership and timeshare the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the timeshare segment consists of multiunit vacation ownership properties and generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare intervals owned by hilton and third parties resort operations and providing consumer financing for the timeshare intervals 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and the middle east and africa are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 76  percent of our systemwide hotel rooms were located in the us we expect that the percentage of our hotel rooms outside the us will continue to increase in future years as hotels in our pipeline open 

system growth and pipeline 

our management and franchise contracts are designed to expand our business with limited or no capital investment the capital required to build and maintain hotels that we manage or franchise is typically provided by the owner of the respective hotel with minimal or no capital required by us as the manager or franchisor additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capital 

to support our growth strategy we continue to expand our development pipeline as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 1351  hotels in our development pipeline representing approximately 230000  rooms under construction or approved for 

development throughout 79  countries and territories of the rooms in the pipeline approximately 129000  rooms representing 56  percent of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2014  approximately 121000  rooms representing over half  of our development pipeline were under construction all of the rooms in the pipeline and under construction are within our management and franchise segment we do not consider any individual development project relating to properties under our management and franchise segment to be material to us 

recent events 

sale of waldorf astoria new york 

in february 2015 we completed the sale of the waldorf astoria new york for a purchase price of 195 billion and the existing waldorf astoria loan of approximately 525 million was repaid in full we used the proceeds from the sale as part of a tax deferred exchange of real property to acquire five properties for a total purchase price of 176 billion including the assumption of a 450 million mortgage loan secured by two of the acquired properties

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations 

 

 45 

development of these relationships these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party additionally in recent years we have entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers our supply of thirdparty developed timeshare intervals was approximately 109000  or   82 percent   of our total supply  as of december 31 2014  we expect sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers and resort operations to comprise a growing percentage of our timeshare revenue and revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare intervals developed by us to comprise a smaller percentage of our timeshare revenue in future periods consistent with our strategy to focus our business on the management aspects and deploy less of our capital to asset construction 

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods 

seasonality 

the lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter producing the strongest revenues of the year 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4278  hotels in our system as of december 31 2014  3514  have been classified as comparable hotels our 764 noncomparable hotels included 73  properties or less than two percent of the total hotels in our system that were removed from the comparable group during the last year because they sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 4073 hotels in our system as of december 31 2013  3548 were classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2013  

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room 

we calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by room nights available to guests for a given period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at our hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis all periods use the same exchange rates unless otherwise noted 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda presented herein is a financial measure that is not recognized under united states of america us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that reflects net income attributable to hilton stockholders excluding interest expense a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we consider ebitda to be a useful measure of operating performance due to the significance of our longlived assets and level of indebtedness 

adjusted ebitda presented herein is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude certain gains losses and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructuringsretirements iv noncash impairment losses v furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements vi reorganization costs vii sharebased and certain other compensation expenses prior to and in connection with our ipo viii severance relocation and other expenses and ix other items 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with us gaap in addition our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i ebitda and adjusted ebitda are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations   

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2014 compared with year ended december 31 2013 

the hotel operating statistics for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



the hotel operating statistics by region for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



during the year ended december 31   2014  we experienced revpar increases in all segments and regions of our business with occupancy and rate increases in all regions except middle east and africa where rates declined and market demand increased over 2013 

revenues 

owned and leased hotels 



during the year ended december 31 2014  the overall improved performance at our owned and leased hotels was primarily a result of improvement in revpar of 56  percent at our comparable owned and leased hotels 

as of december 31 2014  we had 40  consolidated owned and leased hotels located in the us comprising 25276  rooms the increase  in revenues from our us owned and leased hotels was primarily a result of an increase in revpar at our us comparable owned and leased hotels of 69 percent which was due to increases in occupancy and adr of 17 percentage points and 46 percent respectively the increase in revpar at our us comparable owned and leased hotels was attributable to increases in both transient guests and group business in addition food and beverage revenues increased 70 percent primarily as a result of increased spending by group customers 

as of december 31 2014  we had 87  consolidated owned and leased hotels located outside of the us comprising 25280  rooms the increase  in revenues from our international nonus owned and leased hotels included an unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates of 17 million on a currency neutral basis revenue increased 41 million the increase in currency neutral revenue resulted from an increase in revpar at our international comparable owned and leased hotels of 32 percent which was primarily a result of increased occupancy of 21 percentage points 

management and franchise fees and other 

management and franchise fee revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 totaled 1311 million and 1115 million respectively the increase of 196 million or 176 percent in management and franchise fee business reflects increases 

in revpar of 70 percent  and 75 percent  at our comparable managed and franchised properties respectively the increases in revpar for managed and franchised hotels were as a result of increases in both occupancy and adr 

the addition of new hotels to our managed and franchised system also contributed to the growth in revenue during 2014 we added 29 managed properties on a net basis contributing an additional 9142 rooms to our system as well as 188 franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 28636 rooms to our system as new hotels are established in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods 

other revenues were 90 million and 60 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 the increase in other revenues was primarily a result of the increase in revenues earned by our purchasing operations 

timeshare 



timeshare sales revenue increased 23 million as a result of increases in commissions recognized from the sale of thirdparty developed intervals of approximately 47 million partially offset by a decrease of approximately 24 million in revenue from the sale of timeshare intervals developed by us primarily resulting from the deferral of revenue recognition due to sales of developed projects that are partially complete we expect the decline in sales of our owned timeshare inventory to continue as we further develop our capital light timeshare business with a focus on selling timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers resort operations revenue increased approximately 37 million resulting from increased transient rentals 

operating expenses

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual 

results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives 

we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment losses 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 7483 million  of property and equipment net and 1980 million  of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2014  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any property and equipment with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows would result in impairment losses we did not identify any intangible assets with finite lives for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows projected operating results or other significant assumptions would result in impairment losses

we evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investment’s fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investment’s fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations 

our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own andor operate hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above if there are indicators of potential impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above 

we had 170 million  of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2014  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment losses 

acquisitions 

property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to land buildings and leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we evaluate several factors including market data for similar assets expected future cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit price when evaluating the fair value of our assets other assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date changes to these factors could affect the measurement and allocation of fair value 

goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 24   business segments  in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we evaluate the fair value of our reporting units quantitatively when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units’ cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 

we had 6154 million  of goodwill as of december 31 2014  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each reporting units by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of our reporting units 

brands 

we evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models for hotels that we manage or franchise under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brand’s estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses 

we had 4963 million  of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2014  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each of our brands by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of the brand intangible assets 

hilton hhonors 

hilton hhonors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay 

we had 1169 million  of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2014  including 449 million  in current liabilities changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability a 10 percent decrease to the breakage estimate used in determining future award redemption obligations would increase our guest loyalty liability by approximately 44 million 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates 

we had 96 million  of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2014  changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance a 10 percent increase to our default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for loan losses by approximately 39 million 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the morelikelythannot designation changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax expense benefit which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in our partnerships and other investments including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or have a controlling general partner interest of a partnership assuming the absence of other factors determining control including the ability of minority owners to participate in or block certain decisions changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions refer to note 21   sharebased compensation  in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt interest rates on our variablerate debt discussed below are based on onemonth and threemonth libor so we are most vulnerable to changes in this rate 

under the terms of the cmbs loan and waldorf astoria loan entered into in connection with the debt refinancing we are required to hedge interest rate risk using derivative instruments under the cmbs loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the variablerate component or 875 million which caps onemonth libor at 60 percent for the initial term of the variablerate component under the waldorf astoria loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the loan or 525 million which caps onemonth libor at 40 percent for the first 24 months thereafter we are required to renew the interest rate cap agreement annually as of december 31 2014 the fair value of these interest rate caps were immaterial to our consolidated balance sheet 

additionally in october 2013 we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of 145 billion with a term of five years which swapped the floating threemonth libor on a portion of the term loans to a fixed rate of 187 percent the carrying value and fair value of these four interest rate swaps was 4 million  as of december 31 2014

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various foreign currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates this exposure is primarily related to our international assets and liabilities whose value could change materially in reference to our usd reporting currency the most significant effect of changes to foreign currency values include certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested and management and franchise fee revenues earned in foreign currencies as of december 31 2014 we held nine  shortterm foreign exchange forward contracts in the notional amount of 28 million  to offset exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency denominated cash balances

our businesses 

we operate our business across three segments 1 management and franchise 2 ownership and 3 timeshare for more information regarding our segments see part ii—item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 24  business segments in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2013  our system included the following properties and rooms by type brand and region 



 

 

management and franchise 

through our management and franchise segment we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees this segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners’ associations at timeshare properties we grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties these contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned 

hotel and timeshare management 

our core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property terms of our management agreements vary but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of each hotel’s gross revenue and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits cash flow or a combination thereof in general the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our outofpocket expenses in turn our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets additionally the owners generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs as of december 31 2013  we managed 498  hotels with 143771  rooms excluding our owned and leased hotels 

the initial terms of our management agreements for fullservice hotels typically are 20 years in certain cases where we have entered into a franchise agreement as well as a management agreement we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary but typically are more prevalent in fullservice hotels typically these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement 

some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually andor in comparison to specified competitive hotels we often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period although in some cases our cure rights are limited 

in addition to the thirdparty owned hotels we manage we provide management services for 42  timeshare properties owned by homeowners associations and 155  owned leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognize management fee revenues 

franchising 

we franchise our brand names trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements we do not directly participate in the daytoday management or operation of franchised hotels we conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained and consult with franchisees concerning certain aspects of hotel operations we approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels as well as certain aspects of development in some cases we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system as of december 31 2013  there were 3420  franchised hotels with 466642  rooms 

each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee franchisees also pay a royalty fee generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s total gross room revenue and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs internet technology and reservation systems expenses and quality assurance program costs franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges including payments for participation in our hilton hhonors reward program training consultation and procurement of certain goods and services 

our franchise agreements typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years for new construction and approximately 10 to 20 years for properties that are converted from other brands at the expiration of the initial term we may relicense the hotel to the franchisee at our or the hotel owner’s option or by mutual agreement for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards if a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages 

ownership 

we are among the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned leased and joint venture hotels our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties includes a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as new york city london san francisco chicago são paolo sydney and tokyo the portfolio includes iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value including the waldorf astoria new york the hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction purchases or leases of hotels investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies in recent years we have expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with thirdparty hotel owners 

we have focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by among other things implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs through our disciplined approach to asset management we have developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and at many of our hotels we have renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability at certain of our hotels we are evaluating options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use 

timeshare 

our timeshare segment generates revenue from three primary sources 

 

 

 

hgv’s primary product is a feesimple timeshare interest deeded in perpetuity this ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights generally for one week at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the hgv club giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options including a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded stays at any resort in the hgv system reservations for experiential travel such as cruises conversion to hilton hhonors points for stays at our hotels and other options including stays at more than 5000 resorts included in the rci timeshare vacation exchange network in addition we operate the hilton club which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the hilton new york but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the hgv club as of december 31 2013  hgv managed a global system of 42  resorts and the hgv club and the hilton club had more than 212000 members in total 

competition 

we encounter active and robust competition as a hotel residential resort and timeshare manager franchisor and developer competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility location level of service quality of accommodations amenities food and beverage options and outlets public spaces and other guest services consistency of service room rate brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system our properties and brands compete with other hotels resorts motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments including facilities owned by local interests individuals national and international chains institutions investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts reits we believe that our position as a multibranded owner operator manager and franchisor of hotels makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world 

our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies national and international hotel brands and ownership companies including hotel reits while local and independent brand competitors vary on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as accor sa carlson rezidor group fairmont raffles hotels international hong kong and shanghai hotels limited hyatt hotels corporation intercontinental hotel group marriott international mövenpick hotels and resorts starwood hotels  resorts worldwide and wyndham worldwide corporation 

in the timeshare business we compete with other hotel and resort timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use and opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards in addition we compete based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as with national and independent timeshare resale companies and owners reselling existing timeshare intervals which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new timeshare intervals our competitors in the timeshare space include hyatt residence club marriott vacations worldwide corp starwood vacation ownership and wyndham vacation resorts 

seasonality 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customerbase served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest 

cyclicality 

the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis key macroeconomic indicators there is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles the combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties the costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable as a result in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues the vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market 

intellectual property 

in the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents are very important to the success of our business we have a significant number of trademarks service marks trade names logos patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance registration and protection of our trademarks service marks trade names logos and patents which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality 

government regulation 

our business is subject to various foreign and us federal and state laws and regulations including laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular state and extensive state and federal laws and regulations relating to our timeshare business primarily relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare intervals

we also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels however with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in puerto rico and one property in egypt third parties manage and operate the casinos we hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in puerto rico and egypt and employ 

thirdparty compliance consultants and service providers as a result our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions

insurance 

we maintain insurance coverage for general liability property including business interruption terrorism workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned hotels most of our insurance policies are written with selfinsured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks these policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our selfinsured retentions or deductibles our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design development and operation of our hotels

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we are subject to the business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

our business is subject to a number of business financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality services and timeshare products or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties as a result any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services 

macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services including demand for rooms at properties that we manage franchise own lease or develop as well as demand for timeshare properties these factors include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth 

consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned properties limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and reducing overall demand for timeshare intervals in addition many of the expenses associated with our business including personnel costs interest rent property taxes insurance and utilities are relatively fixed during a period of overall economic weakness if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels and timeshare properties decreases our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected 

  

the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property depending principally upon location and the customer base served we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest in addition the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows on a lagged basis the general economy the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition 

because we operate in a highly competitive industry our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively 

the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition our principal competitors are other operators of luxury fullservice and focusedservice and timeshare properties including other major hospitality chains with wellestablished and recognized brands we also compete against smaller hotel chains independent and local hotel owners and operators and independent timeshare operators if we are unable to compete successfully our revenues or profits may decline 

competition for hotel guests   

we face competition for individual guests group reservations and conference business we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location room rates property size and availability of rooms and conference space quality of the accommodations customer satisfaction amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively 

competition for management and franchise agreements   

we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services brand name recognition and reputation our ability and willingness to invest capital availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of suitable properties is limited our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced 

competition for sales of timeshare properties   

we compete with other timeshare operators for sales of timeshare intervals based principally on location quality of accommodations price financing terms quality of service terms of property use opportunity for timeshare owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards as well as brand name recognition and reputation our ability to attract and retain purchasers of timeshare intervals depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our timeshare offerings from those offered by others if we are unable to do so our ability to compete effectively for sales of timeshare intervals could be adversely affected 

  

any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets our ability to attract and retain guests depends in part on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation in addition the success of our hotel owners’ businesses and their ability to make payments to us may indirectly depend on the strength and reputation of our brands such dependence makes our business susceptible to risks regarding brand obsolescence and to reputational damage if our brands become obsolete or are viewed as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels and further we may be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners 

in addition many factors can negatively affect the reputation of any individual brand or the overall brand of our company changes in ownership or management practices the occurrence of accidents or injuries natural disasters crime individual guest notoriety or similar events can have a substantial negative effect on our reputation create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations events occurring in one location could have a resulting negative effect on the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations in addition the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such incidents we could also face legal claims related to these events along with adverse publicity resulting from such litigation if the perceived quality of our brands declines or if our reputation is damaged our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain good relationships with thirdparty hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business depends on our ability to establish and maintain longterm positive relationships with thirdparty property owners and on our ability to renew existing and enter into new management and franchise agreements the management and franchise contracts we enter into with thirdparty owners are typically longterm arrangements but may allow the hotel owner to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances including in certain cases the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to among other things risks common to the overall hotel industry including factors outside of our control in addition any negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements and enter into new agreements on favorable terms we may be unable to expand our presence and our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our management and franchise business is subject to real estate investment risks for thirdparty owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

the ability to grow our management and franchise business is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments our ability to sustain continued growth through management and franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised branded hotels is affected and may potentially be limited by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally these include site availability the availability of financing planning zoning and other local approvals other limitations that may be imposed by market factors include projected room occupancy changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure any inability by us or our thirdparty owners to manage these factors effectively could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth 

  

if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans our revenues profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed 

many of the properties owned by our thirdparty property owners are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into when such properties were purchased or refinanced by them if our thirdparty property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all their lenders could declare a default accelerate the related debt and repossess the property any such repossessions could result in the termination of our management and franchise agreements or eliminate revenues and cash flows from such property which could negatively affect our business and results of operations in addition the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy develop and improve hotels and in some cases fund operations during down cycles our hotel owners’ inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans with respect to existing hotels as well as result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline 

if thirdparty property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer 

substantially all of our management and franchise agreements require thirdparty property owners to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining the quality and reputation of our branded hotel properties this includes requirements related to the physical condition safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by employees these standards may evolve with customer preference or we may introduce new requirements and team members over time if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with such standards guest preference for our brands could diminish and this could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition if thirdparty property owners fail to observe standards and meet their contractual requirements we may elect to exercise our termination rights which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these relationships we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships 

contractual and other disagreements with thirdparty property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses 

our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements at any given time we may be in disputes with one or more of our hotel owners any such dispute could be very expensive for us even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any thirdparty an adverse result in any of these proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore specific to our industry some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of thirdparty hotel properties which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination in the event of any such termination our fees from such properties would be eliminated and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate which could increase our costs reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions 

we own or lease a substantial amount of real property as one of our three business segments real estate ownership and leasing is subject to various risks that may or may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties including 

  

 

 

 

 

 16 

 

 

 

the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned properties because we as the owner bear the risk of their high fixedcost structure further during times of economic distress declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all accordingly we may not be able to adjust our owned property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

our efforts to develop redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive which could reduce revenues or impair our ability to compete effectively 

certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed more than a century ago the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties while we have budgeted for replacements and repairs to furniture fixtures and hotel equipment at our properties there can be no assurance that these replacements and repairs will occur or even if completed will result in improved performance in addition these efforts are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance our operations and financial results could be negatively affected 

our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed 

certain of our properties may qualify as legallypermissible nonconforming uses and improvements including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties if a substantial portion of any such properties were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds any loss of this nature whether insured or not could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects 

we share control in joint venture projects which limits our ability to manage thirdparty risks associated with these projects 

joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of our joint venture assets in most cases we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the ventures therefore joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations in addition we may be unable to take action without the 

approval of our joint venture partners or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent consequently actions by a coventurer or other thirdparty could expose us to claims for damages financial penalties and reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations in addition we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or coventurer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other coventurers such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a coventurer in which case we may be liable in the event such coventurer defaults on its guarantee obligation the nonperformance of such obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed under such obligations 

preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures any deficiencies in our joint ventures’ internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud such deficiencies also could result in restatements of or other adjustments to our previously reported or announced operating results which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares additionally if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports 

although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners additionally in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our return on these investments 

the timeshare business is subject to extensive regulation and failure to comply with such regulation may have an adverse effect on our business 

we develop manage market and sell timeshare intervals certain of these activities are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the timeshare property is located and the states in which the timeshare property is marketed and sold federal regulation of certain marketing practices also applies in addition we provide financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals and we also service the resulting loans this practice subjects us to various federal and state regulations including those which require disclosure to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans as well as settlement servicing and collection of loans if we fail to comply with applicable federal state and local laws in connection with our timeshare business we may not be able to offer timeshare intervals or associated financing in certain areas and as a result the timeshare business could suffer a decline in revenues 

  

a decline in timeshare interval inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain timeshare management agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

in addition to timeshare interval inventory from our owned timeshare properties we source inventory through sales and marketing agreements with thirdparty developers if we fail to develop timeshare properties or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with thirdparty developers we may experience a decline in timeshare interval inventory available to be sold by us which could result in a decrease in our revenues in addition a decline in timeshare interval inventory could result in both a decrease of financing revenues that are generated from purchasers of timeshare intervals and fee revenues that are generated by providing management services to the timeshare properties 

if purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their purchases of timeshare intervals the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

providing secured financing to some purchasers of timeshare intervals subjects us to the risk of purchaser default as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 994 million  of timeshare financing receivables outstanding if a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the timeshare interval through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure if the timeshare interval has declined in value we may incur impairment losses that reduce our profits in addition we may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at the same price or at all also if a purchaser of a timeshare interval defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period we may not have recovered the marketing selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that timeshare interval if we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate the revenues and profits that we derive from the timeshare business could be reduced 

some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects 

as of december 31 2013  we had a total of 1123  hotels in our development pipeline which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks including in certain cases obtaining governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing as a result our entire development pipeline may not develop into new hotels 

new hotel brands or nonhotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have launched several new brand concepts over the last few years we opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011 launched the eforea spa at hilton brand in 2010 and opened the first herb n kitchen restaurant in 2013 we may continue to build our portfolio of branded hotel products and nonhotel branded concepts by launching new hotel and nonhotel brands in the future in addition the hilton garden inn doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brands will have in the development and consumer marketplaces if new branded hotel products nonhotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate we may not recover the costs we incurred in developing or expanding such brands and this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

failures in material damage to or interruptions in our information technology systems software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management procurement reservations and the operation of the hilton hhonors customer loyalty program such systems are subject to among other things damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses and natural and manmade disasters in addition substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility and any loss or damage to the facility could result in operational disruption and data loss damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update remediate or replace with alternate systems and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result in addition costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations any material interruptions or failures in our systems including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance 

we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide and the provision of information technology and business process services in particular our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us in a timely manner or at all and our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 

we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications including changes in required technology interfaces website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications additional risks include computer viruses changes in applicable federal and state regulation security breaches legal claims related to our website operations and ecommerce 

fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

cyberattacks could have a disruptive effect on our business 

from time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyberattacks attempted breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information systems interruption or the disruption of our operations for example in 2011 we were notified by epsilon our database marketing vendor that we were among a group of companies served by epsilon that were affected by a data breach that resulted in an unauthorized third party gaining access to epsilon’s files that included names and emails of certain of our customers 

 even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has increased in recent years any breach theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites mobile applications and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us any such security breach could expose us to risks of data loss business disruption litigation and other liability any of which could adversely affect our business 

we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests’ personal information 

we are subject to various risks associated with the collection handling storage and transmission of sensitive information including risks related to compliance with us and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations as well as the risk that our systems collecting such information could be compromised in the course of doing business we collect large volumes of internal and customer data including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for various business purposes including managing our workforce providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes our various information technology systems enter process summarize and report such data if we fail to maintain compliance with the various us and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards we could be exposed to fines penalties restrictions litigation or other expenses and our business could be adversely affected 

 in addition states and the federal government have recently enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business and if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention 

we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands businesses properties or other assets furthermore we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties in many cases we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us acquisitions or investments in brands businesses properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business including risks related to 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions investments or alliances similarly we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all or the ability to obtain financing may not be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness in addition the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations 

we may also divest certain properties or assets and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns in some circumstances sales of properties or other assets may result in losses upon a sale of properties or assets we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations incur material tax liabilities or as a result of required debt repayment face a shortage of liquidity finally any acquisitions investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations which could harm our business 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position 

the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management brand assurance and compliance procurement reservation systems operation of our customer loyalty programs distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities these technologies may require refinements and upgrades the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a costeffective and timely manner we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system 

failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws including with regard to direct marketing could result in fines or place restrictions on our business 

we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques including telemarketing email marketing and postal mailings and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the us and internationally which govern marketing and advertising practices any further restrictions in laws such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telemarketing sales rule canspam act of 2003 and various us state laws new laws or international data protection laws such as the eu member states’ implementation of proposed privacy regulation that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy if this occurs we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies’ marketing materials if access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired 

the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability 

a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests is booked through internet travel intermediaries we contract with such intermediaries and pay them various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems if such bookings increase these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees although we have established agreements with many of these intermediaries that limit transaction fees for hotels there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration replacement or renegotiation moreover hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites as a result consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems if this happens our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites 

in addition in general internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or transient business rather than group and convention business however hospitality intermediaries have recently grown their business to include marketing to large group and convention business if that growth continues it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and it could also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business 

recent class action litigation against several online travel intermediaries and lodging companies including hilton challenges the legality under certain antitrust laws of certain provisions in contracts and alleged practices with thirdparty intermediaries while we are vigorously defending the litigation and believe the contract provisions are lawful the courts will 

ultimately determine this issue our fees and expenses associated with this litigation even if we ultimately prevail could be material any adverse outcome could require us to alter our business arrangements with these intermediaries and consequently could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 

we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly either online or by telephone to our call centers or through intermediaries like travel agents internet travel web sites and other distribution channels the cost speed efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands any failure to maintain or upgrade and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business 

the cessation reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton hhonors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty 

we manage the hilton hhonors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements system hotels including without limitation thirdparty hotels under management and franchise arrangements contribute a percentage of the guest’s charges to the program for each stay of a program member in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands hilton hhonors arranges with thirdparty service providers such as airlines and rail companies to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards currently the program benefits are not taxed as income to members if the program awards and benefits are materially altered curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hhonors members choose to no longer participate in the program this could adversely affect our business 

because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business 

we currently manage franchise own or lease hotels and resorts in 91  countries around the world our operations outside the united states represented approximately 25  percent and 27  percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict any one or more of them could lower our revenues increase our costs reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs reduce profits limit growth or subject us to broader liability 

our business operations in countries outside the us are subject to a number of laws and regulations including restrictions imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies’ transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on us foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states organizations and individuals we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions rules and regulations given the nature of our business it is possible that hotels we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to persons subject to sanctions where we have identified potential violations in the past we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac in addition some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions including the uk’s bribery act 2010 which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities and other local anticorruption laws in the countries in which we conduct operations 

if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be exposed to claims for damages financial penalties reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties including the termination of management franchising and ownership rights in addition in certain circumstances the actions of parties affiliated with us including our owners joint venture partners team members and agents may expose us to liability under the fcpa us sanctions or other laws these restrictions could increase costs of operations reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth 

in august 2012 congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshra which expands the scope of us sanctions against iran and syria in particular section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report in some cases itrshra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they would otherwise be permissible under us law these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the us president and certain us congressional committees the us president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities to determine whether sanctions should be imposed 

under itrshra we are required to report if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10k or quarterly reports on form 10q we have engaged in and may in the future engage in activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 991 to this annual report on form 10k which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein in addition because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us because we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone affiliates of blackstone may also be considered our affiliates other affiliates of blackstone have in the past and may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra disclosure of such activities even if such activities are permissible under applicable law and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

the loss of senior executives or key field personnel such as general managers could significantly harm our business 

our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships including relationships with thirdparty property owners joint venture partners and vendors and limit our ability to execute our business strategies 

we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of team members these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide the failure to retain train or successfully manage general managers for our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could negatively affect our operations 

collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

a significant number of our employees approximately 26  percent and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse the properties we manage franchise own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes lockouts boycotts and public demonstrations a number of our collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 17 percent of our organized employees have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized labor disputes which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests further adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs changes in work rules that raise operating expenses legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our thirdparty property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many thirdparty property owners increased unionization of our workforce new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies 

  

labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain train manage and engage employees our managed owned leased and joint venture hotels are staffed by approximately 152000  team members around the world if we are unable to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees our ability to manage and staff the managed owned leased and joint venture hotels could be impaired which could reduce customer satisfaction in addition the inability of our franchisees to attract retain train manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs which could adversely affect our results of operations 

any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business 

the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success we have over 4700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services at any given time we also have a number of pending applications to register trademarks and other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions however those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or that the steps we take to use control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the us and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions for example in certain jurisdictions third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications defending against any such proceedings may be costly and if unsuccessful 

could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks 

our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the us where local law or lax enforcement of law may not provide adequate protection if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation of this type could be costly force us to divert our resources lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation in addition we license certain of our trademarks to third parties for example we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property if a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks our rights to and the value of our trademarks could potentially be harmed failure to maintain control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or thirdparty owners and could adversely affect our results 

in addition we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties such rights include the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees if we are unable to use such intellectual property our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished 

thirdparty claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses 

third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent trademark copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future any such claims even those without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition we may be required to indemnify thirdparty owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them all necessary royalty licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms any adverse results associated with thirdparty intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results 

conducting business in currencies other than the us dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on financial results we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the us as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of us dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the us dollars received from foreign currency revenues we also have exposure to currency translation risk because generally the results of our business outside of the us are reported in local currency and then translated to us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements as a result changes between the foreign exchange rates and the us dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on financial results our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the us increases 

to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce certain of our exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates however these hedging agreements 

may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs credit requirements and counterparty risk 

if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage franchise or own our profits could be reduced 

we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us our owners or the surrounding area we carry and we require our owners to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first and thirdparty losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary nevertheless market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or which may otherwise restrict our or our owners’ ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the event of a substantial loss the insurance coverage that we andor our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property because certain types of losses are uncertain they can be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive in addition there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies 

  

in some cases these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured as a result we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues profits management fees or franchise fees from the property 

terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington dc area congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 which established the terrorism insurance program to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts on december 26 2007 the terrorism insurance program was extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 through december 31 2014 tripra we carry and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both firstparty and thirdparty liability losses related to terrorism we purchase our firstparty property damage and business interruption insurance from a standalone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools if tripra is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2014 premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase andor the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable 

terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry 

the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future in particular properties that are wellknown or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks 

the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could 

 

 

 

 

 

certain of our buildings are also highly profitable properties to our business in addition to the effects noted above the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of these properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results 

of operations furthermore the loss of any of our wellknown buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects 

changes in us federal state and local or foreign tax law interpretations of existing tax law or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation at the federal state or provincial and local levels in the us and various other countries and jurisdictions our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax from time to time the us federal state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we record tax expense based in part on our estimates of expected future tax rates reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards 

we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in us federal and various state local and foreign jurisdictions in particular our consolidated us federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 and october 24 2007 are under audit by the internal revenue service irs and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans our hilton hhonors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreigncurrency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries in total the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in us federal tax owed of approximately 696 million  excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes we disagree with the irs’s position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them see note 19   income taxes  in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs penalties and interest thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations 

changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future a change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for example in 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised exposure draft outlining proposed changes to current lease accounting in fasb accounting standards codification topic 840 leases  the proposed accounting standards update if ultimately adopted in its current form could result in significant changes to current accounting including the capitalization of leases on the balance sheet that currently are recorded offbalance sheet as operating leases while this change would not affect the cash flow related to our leased hotels and other leased assets it could adversely affect our balance sheet and could therefore affect our ability to raise financing from banks or other sources 

changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

our total assets include goodwill intangible assets with indefinite lives other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of longlived assets principally property and equipment including hotel properties we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results after performing our evaluation for impairment including an analysis to determine the recoverability of longlived assets we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets if these impairment losses are significant our results of operations would be adversely affected 

governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties 

in many jurisdictions the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or us federal state and local governmental regulations including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or us state and local departments relating to health sanitation fire and safety standards and to laws governing their relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements we or our thirdparty owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or us federal state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

foreign or us environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities 

we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and us federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions the use storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances and wastewater disposal our failure to comply with such laws including any required permits or licenses could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned leased or operated real property including managed and franchised properties or at thirdparty locations in connection with our waste disposal operations regardless of whether or not we knew of or caused the presence or release of such substances from time to time we may be required to remediate such substances or remove abate or manage asbestos mold radon gas lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in thirdparty claims for personal injury property or natural resource damages business interruption or other losses such claims and the need to investigate remediate or otherwise address hazardous toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations the value of any affected real property or our ability to sell lease or assign our rights in any such property or could otherwise harm our business or reputation environmental health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent and our costs may increase as a result for example the us congress the us environmental protection agency and some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations such as those related to climate change could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us the potential for changes in the frequency duration and severity of extreme weather events that may be a result of climate change could lead to significant property damage at our hotels and other assets affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in areas that are most vulnerable to such events such as the coastal resort areas where we operate and have a negative effect on revenues 

the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the us may be substantial 

we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ada and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the us under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26 1993 public accommodations built before january 26 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is readily achievable the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief fines an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance any imposition of injunctive relief fines damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands in november 2010 we entered into a settlement with the us department of justice related to compliance with the ada under the terms of the settlement until november 2014 we must ensure compliance with ada regulations at our owned and joint venture in which we own more than a 50 interest properties built after january 26 1993 require managed or franchised hotels built after january 26 1993 that enter into a new management or franchise agreement experience a change in ownership or renew or extend a management or franchise agreement to conduct a survey of its facilities and to certify that the hotel complies with the ada ensure that new hotels constructed in our system are compliant with ada regulations provide ada training to our team members improve the accessibility of our websites and reservations system for individuals with disabilities appoint a national ada compliance officer and appoint an ada contact onsite at each hotel if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada and our related consent decree we could be subject to fines penalties injunctive action reputational harm and other business effects which could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses 

several of our properties feature casinos most of which are operated by third parties factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located including nevada new jersey puerto rico and egypt have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered once issued a registration remains in force until revoked the law defines the grounds for registration as well as revocation or suspension of such registration the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results 

we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us 

legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees thirdparty owners of managed properties employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results in recent years a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters consumer protection claims and other commercial matters a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type which could have a material adverse effect on our business at any given time we may be engaged in lawsuits involving thirdparty owners of our hotels similarly we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations our ability to operate our business our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2013  our total indebtedness was approximately 127 billion  including 968 million  of nonrecourse debt and our contractual debt maturities of our longterm debt and nonrecourse debt for the years ending december 31 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively were 52 million  69 million  and 622 million  our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences including 

 

 

 29 

 

 

 

 

 

we are a holding company and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by and most of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations moreover there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits as a result although a subsidiary of ours may have cash we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations 

  

certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities 

the indenture that governs our senior notes the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities and the agreements that govern our commercial mortgagebacked securities loan and the mortgage loan secured by our waldorf astoria new york property impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability andor the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition if on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30 2014 the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans swing line loans andor letters of credit excluding up to 50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or backstopped that are issued andor outstanding is greater than 25 of the revolving credit facility the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 79 to 10 our subsidiaries’ mortgagebacked loans also require them to maintain certain debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements 

as a result of these restrictions we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders andor amend the covenants 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness andor the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors some of which are not within our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms or at all and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements in addition the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives 

  

despite our current level of indebtedness we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations such as trade payables that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding two risk factors would increase 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

our sponsor and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 764 of our common stock as of february 12 2014 moreover under our bylaws and the stockholders’ agreement with our sponsor and its affiliates for so long as our existing owners and their affiliates retain significant ownership of us we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by our sponsor whom we refer to as the sponsor directors even when our sponsor and its affiliates cease to own shares of our stock representing a majority of the total voting power for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval accordingly for such period of time our sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management business plans and policies including the appointment and removal of our officers in particular for so long as our sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our stock our sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

our sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities including investments in real estate generally and in the hospitality industry in particular in the ordinary course of their business activities our sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders for example our sponsor owns interests in extended stay america inc and la quinta hotels and certain other investments in the hotel industry that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition affiliates of our sponsor directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us including hotel or timeshare development projects 

that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our sponsor any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate our sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

  

we are a controlled company within the meaning of new york stock exchange nyse rules and as a result qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements 

affiliates of our sponsor control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a result we are a controlled company within the meaning of nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards such as requirements that within one year of the date of nyse listing a company have 

 

 

 

we do not have a majority of independent directors on our board in addition although we have a fully independent audit committee and have independent director representation on our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors we intend to continue to utilize these controlled company exemptions accordingly our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

we will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business 

as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses including costs associated with public company reporting requirements we also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sarbanesoxley act and related rules implemented by the sec and the nyse the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty these laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance including director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage these laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as our executive officers furthermore if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company we could be subject to delisting of our common stock fines sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected 

as a public company we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with our second annual report on form 10k we will be required to furnish reports by management and our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over 

financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the nyse the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

  

because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends the declaration amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by our senior secured credit facility and our senior notes and may be limited by covenants of other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

future issuances of common stock by us and the availability for resale of shares held by our preipo investors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock after the expiration or earlier waiver or termination of the lockup periods described below substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be available for resale in the public market registration of the sale of these shares of our common stock would permit their sale into the market immediately the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

pursuant to a registration rights agreement we have granted our sponsor and certain management stockholders the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them these shares represented approximately 772 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 

in connection with our initial public offering we our executive officers directors and holders of certain of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering including our sponsor that collectively owned approximately 778 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 signed lockup agreements with the underwriters of the initial public offering that subject to certain customary exceptions restrict the sale of the shares of our common stock held by them for 180 days following the date of the initial public offering prospectus subject to extension in the case of an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us deutsche bank securities inc and goldman sachs  co may in their sole discretion release all or any portion of the shares of common stock subject to lockup agreements in addition former members of hilton global holdings llc hgh including our sponsor who received in the aggregate approximately 829481530 shares of our common stock or approximately 842 percent of our outstanding common stock as of february 12 2014 from hgh in connection with our initial public offering are prohibited from transferring such shares for six months beginning on their receipt of such shares on the date of the pricing of our initial public offering one third of the shares they received approximately 276493843 shares may be transferred between 6 and 12 months following the date of receipt and an additional one third of the shares they receive approximately 276493843 shares may be transferred between 13 and 18 months after the date of receipt the transfer restrictions applicable to such holders will lapse after 18 months after the date of receipt in addition while transfer restrictions applicable to former members of hgh currently provide for the restrictions described above these contractual provisions may be waived modified or amended at any time 

as of february 12 2014 we had granted 19500 restricted stock units to our independent directors under our 2013 omnibus incentive plan an aggregate of 79980500 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the 2013 omnibus incentive plan as of february 12 2014 we have filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities 

act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2013 omnibus incentive plan accordingly shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market 

as restrictions on resale end the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors among other things 

 

 

 

   

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

overview 

our business 

hilton worldwide is   one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world with 4115  hotels resorts and timeshare properties comprising 678630  rooms in 91  countries and territories in the nearly 100 years since our founding we have defined the hospitality industry and established a portfolio of 10 worldclass brands our flagship fullservice hilton hotels  resorts brand is the most recognized hotel brand in the world our premier brand portfolio also includes our luxury hotel brands waldorf astoria hotels  resorts and conrad hotels  resorts our fullservice hotel brands doubletree by hilton and embassy suites hotels our focusedservice hotel brands hilton garden inn hampton inn homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton and our timeshare brand hgv we own or lease interests in 155  hotels many of which are located in global gateway cities including iconic properties such as the waldorf astoria new york the hilton hawaiian village and the london hilton on park lane more than 314000  team members proudly serve in our properties and corporate offices around the world and we have approximately 40 million  members in our awardwinning customer loyalty program hilton hhonors 

segments and regions 

management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions our operations consist of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services management and franchise ownership and timeshare the management and franchise segment provides services which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees as well as property management at timeshare properties this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners including our owned and leased hotels and to homeowners associations at timeshare properties as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees as a franchisor of hotels we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services such as our reservation system marketing and information technology services the ownership segment generates revenue from providing hotel room rentals food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels the timeshare segment consists of multiunit vacation ownership properties this segment generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare interests owned by hilton and third parties providing consumer financing and resort operations 

geographically management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific the americas region includes north america south america and central america including all caribbean nations although the us is included in the americas it is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and as such it is presented separately within the analysis herein the emea region includes europe which represents the westernmost peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east and the middle east and africa mea which represents the middle east region and all african nations including the indian ocean island nations europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia as well as india australia new zealand and the pacific island nations 

as of december 31 2013  approximately 77  percent of our systemwide hotel rooms were located in the us we expect that the percentage of our hotel rooms outside the us will continue to increase in future years as hotels in our pipeline open 

system growth and pipeline 

to support our growth strategy we continue to expand our development pipeline as of december 31 2013  we had a total of 1123  hotels in our development pipeline representing 194572  rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 76  countries and territories as of december 31 2013  101810  rooms representing 52  percent of our development pipeline were under construction of the 194572  rooms in the pipeline 117361  rooms representing 60  percent of the pipeline were located outside the us as of december 31 2013  over 99 percent of the rooms under construction and in our total pipeline were within our management and franchise segment and only one development project was within our ownership segment we do not consider that project or any individual development project relating to properties under our management and franchise segment to be material to us 

our management and franchise contracts are designed to expand our business with limited or no capital investment the capital required to build and maintain hotels that we manage or franchise is typically provided by the owner of the respective hotel with minimal or no capital required by us as the manager or franchisor additionally prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location the credit quality of the thirdparty owner and other factors as a result by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with thirdparty owners we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capital

principal components and factors affecting our results of operations 

revenues 

principal components 

we primarily derive our revenues from the following sources 

 45 

of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties as a result occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues 

 

 

 

 

 

factors affecting our revenues 

the following factors affect the revenues we derive from our operations

expenses 

principal components 

we primarily incur the following expenses 

 

 

 47 

 

 

 

factors affecting our costs and expenses 

the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations 

 

 

other items 

effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency which is the us dollar usd and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies as a result we are required to translate those results assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period when comparing our results of operations between periods there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods 

seasonality 

the lodging industry is seasonal in nature however the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location type of property and competitive mix within the specific location based on historical results we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter producing the strongest revenues of the year 

key business and financial metrics used by management 

comparable hotels 

we define our comparable hotels as those that i were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period and open january 1st of the previous year ii have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported and iii have not sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone or planned to undergo largescale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available of the 4073  hotels in our system as of december 31 2013  3548  have been classified as comparable hotels our 525 noncomparable hotels include 14  properties or less than one percent of the total hotels in our system that have been removed from the comparable group during the last year because they have sustained substantial property damage business interruption undergone largescale capital projects or comparable results were not available of the 3926 hotels in our system as of december 31 2012 3484 have been classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31 2012 

occupancy 

occupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases 

average daily rate 

adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy as described above 

revenue per available room 

we calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at our hotels occupancy and adr revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels 

references to revpar and adr throughout this report are presented on a currency neutral all periods using the same exchange rates and comparable basis unless otherwise noted 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda 

ebitda presented herein is a financial measure that is not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap that reflects net income attributable to hilton stockholders excluding interest expense a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization we consider ebitda to be a useful measure of operating performance due to the significance of our longlived assets and level of indebtedness 

adjusted ebitda presented herein is calculated as ebitda as previously defined further adjusted to exclude gains losses and expenses in connection with i asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments ii foreign currency transactions iii debt restructuringsretirements iv noncash impairment losses v furniture fixtures and equipment ffe replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements vi reorganization costs vii sharebased and certain other compensation expenses prior to and in connection with our ipo viii severance relocation and other expenses and ix other items 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with us gaap in addition our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons i ebitda and adjusted ebitda are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions and ii ebitda and adjusted ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry 

ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under us gaap some of these limitations are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of these limitations ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations   

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2013 compared with year ended december 31 2012 

during the year ended december 31   2013  we experienced occupancy increases in all segments of our business and we were able to increase rates in market segments where demand has outpaced supply the hotel operating statistics for our systemwide comparable hotels were as follows 



the systemwide increase in revpar was led by our asia pacific region which experienced an increase of 70 percent due primarily to increased occupancy of 45 percentage points in the americas region which includes the us revpar increased 52 percent due to increased occupancy of 12 percentage points and increased adr of 34 percent our hotels in the mea region experienced a revpar increase of 64 percent due to increased adr of 131 percent offset by decreased occupancy of 37 percentage points our european hotels experienced a revpar increase of 39 percent primarily due to increased occupancy of 22 percentage points 

revenues 



revenues as presented in this section excludes other revenues from managed and franchised properties of  3405 million   and  3124 million  during the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

owned and leased hotels 

during the year ended december 31 2013  the overall improved performance at our owned and leased hotels primarily was a result of improvement in revpar of 46  percent at our comparable owned and leased hotels 

as of december 31 2013  we had 35  consolidated owned and leased hotels located in the us comprising 24050  rooms revenues at our us owned and leased hotels for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  totaled 2058 million  and 1922 million  respectively the increase  of 136 million  or 71 percent  was primarily driven by an increase in revpar at our us comparable owned and leased hotels of 68 percent which was due to increases in occupancy and adr of 16 percentage points and 45 percent respectively 

as of december 31 2013  we had 89  consolidated owned and leased hotels located outside of the us comprising 25781  rooms revenues from our international nonus owned and leased hotels for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012   

totaled 1988 million  and 2057 million  respectively the decrease  of 69 million  or 34 percent  was primarily due to an unfavorable movement in foreign currency rates of 63 million on a currency neutral basis revenue decreased 6 million the decrease in currency neutral revenue was a result of a 44 million decrease in revenue from hotels that we sold or where leases expired during the periods offset by an increase in revenues from our international comparable owned and leased hotels which had a revpar increase of 80 percent the revpar increase was a result of a 42 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 20 percent increase in adr 

management and franchise fees and other 

management and franchise fee revenue for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  totaled 1115 million  and 1032 million  respectively the increase  of 83 million  or 80 percent  reflects increases in revpar of 60 percent  and 50 percent  at our comparable managed and franchised properties respectively the increases in revpar for managed and franchised hotels were driven by both increases in occupancy and adr 

the addition of new hotels to our managed and franchised system also contributed to the growth in revenue during 2013 we added 45 managed properties on a net basis contributing an additional 10196 rooms to our system as well as 108 franchised properties on a net basis providing an additional 16084 rooms to our system as new hotels are established in our system we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods 

other revenues for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  were 60 million  and 56 million  respectively the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenues received from our supply management business

timeshare revenue increased   24 million  due to an increase of approximately 63 million  in sales commissions generated from projects developed by third parties as a result of three properties comprising 1049 units commencing sales during or after the year ended december 31 2012  additionally there was an increase of approximately 9 million  in revenue from our resort operations primarily due to increases in club fees and room rentals as well as an increase of approximately 9 million  in financing and other revenues primarily due to increases in portfolio interest income these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately 57 million  in revenue from the sale of timeshare units developed by us due to lower sales volume of our owned timeshare inventory which we expect to continue as we further develop our capital light timeshare business with a focus on selling timeshare intervals on behalf of thirdparty developers 

operating expenses 



owned and leased hotels 

fluctuations in operating expenses at our owned and leased hotels can be related to various factors including changes in occupancy levels labor costs utilities taxes and insurance costs the change in the number of occupied room nights directly affects certain variable expenses which include payroll supplies and other operating expenses 

us owned and leased hotel expenses totaled 1410 million  and 1370 million  for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the increase  of 40 million  or 29 percent  was due to increased occupancy levels which resulted in an increase in variable operating expenses including labor and utility costs 

international owned and leased hotel expenses totaled 1737 million  and 1860 million  for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the decrease  of 123 million  or 66 percent  was due in part to foreign currency movements which contributed 49 million of the decrease  as international owned and leased hotel expenses on a currency neutral basis decreased 74 million the decrease in currency neutral expenses was primarily due to the expiration of operating leases and sales of certain properties in 2012 as well as cost mitigation strategies and operational efficiencies employed at all of our owned and leased properties 

timeshare 

timeshare expense decreased   28 million  primarily due to lower sales volume at our developed properties resulting in lower cost of sales offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses most significantly related to the shift towards our capital light timeshare business 



depreciation expense increased   28 million  primarily due to 254 million  in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2013  resulting in additional depreciation expense on certain owned and leased assets in 2013 amortization expense increased   25 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily due to capitalized software costs that were placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2012 



 

 

during the year ended december 31 2012 certain markets and properties faced operating and competitive challenges such challenges caused a decline in expected future results of certain owned and leased properties and in the market value of certain corporate buildings which caused us to evaluate the carrying values of these affected properties for impairment as a result of our evaluation we recognized impairment losses of 42 million related to our owned and leased hotels 11 million of impairment losses related to certain corporate office facilities and 1 million of impairment losses related to one cost method investment 



general and administrative expenses consist of our corporate operations compensation and related expenses including sharebased compensation and other operating costs 

general and administrative expenses were 697 million  and 398 million  for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the increase  of 299 million  was primarily due to sharebased compensation expense of approximately 306 million related to the conversion of our executive compensation plan concurrent with our ipo during the fourth quarter of 2013 other expenses for the years ended   december 31 2013  and 2012  were 51 million  and 62 million  respectively the decrease  of 11 million  was primarily due to a reduction in payments required under performance guarantees on certain managed properties between periods 

nonoperating income and expenses 



interest expense increased   51 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily due to the release of 23 million  of debt issuance costs and original issue discount related to the portion of the term loans that was voluntarily prepaid during the year ended december 31 2013 as well as an increase in the average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings these increases were offset by decreases in interest expense as a result of voluntary prepayments of 145 billion made in 2013 prior to our debt refinancing 

  

 

 

the 27 million   increase  in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of 19 million of impairment losses on our equity method investments recognized during the year ended december 31 2012 additionally many of our equity method investments experienced improved operating performance resulting in an increase in the equity in earnings from these unconsolidated affiliates 



 

 

the net gain loss on foreign currency transactions primarily relates to changes in foreign currency rates relating to shortterm crosscurrency intercompany loans 



 

 the gain on debt extinguishment was the result of the debt refinancing which occurred in 2013 see note 13   debt  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 



the other gain net for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily related to a capital lease restructuring by one of our consolidated variable interest entities vies during the period the revised terms reduced the future minimum lease payments resulting in a reduction of the capital lease obligation and a residual amount which was recorded in other gain net 

the other gain net for the year ended december 31 2012  was primarily related to the pretax gain of 5 million resulting from the sale of our interest in an investment in affiliate accounted for under the equity method as well as a 6 million gain due to the resolution of certain contingencies relating to historical asset sales 



the  24 million  increase in income tax expense was primarily the result of an increase in us federal and foreign taxes as a result of higher taxable income partially offset by the benefit of releasing 121 million of valuation allowances against certain foreign and state deferred tax assets during the year ended december 31 2013  refer to note 19   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our tax provision at the us statutory rate to our provision for income taxes

management and franchise fees and other 

management and franchise fee revenue for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 totaled 1032 million and 965 million respectively the increase of 67 million or 69 percent in our management and franchise business reflects increases in revpar of 49 percent and 62 percent at our comparable managed and franchised properties respectively the increases in revpar for both comparable periods for managed and franchised hotels were primarily driven by increased occupancy and rates charged to guests

timeshare 

timeshare revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was 1085 million an increase of 141 million or 149 percent from 944 million during the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was primarily due to a 66 million increase in revenue from the sale of timeshare units developed by us as well as an increase of 46 million in sales commissions and fees earned on projects developed by third parties additionally our revenue from resorts operations and financing and other revenues both increased 9 million 

operating expenses 



us owned and leased hotel expense totaled 1370 million and 1345 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 the increase of 25 million or 19 percent was partially due to increased occupancy of 27 percentage points at our comparable us owned and leased hotels which resulted in an increase in labor and utility costs the increase was also due to increases to sales and marketing expenses insurance expenses and property taxes at our us owned and leased hotels 

international owned and leased hotel expense decreased 8 million or 04 percent to 1860 million from 1868 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 however there were foreign currency movements of 66 million between the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 which decreased owned and leased hotel expenses international owned and leased hotel expenses on a currency neutral basis increased 58 million the increase in currency neutral expense was primarily due to increased occupancy of 19 percentage points at our comparable international owned and leased hotels which resulted in an increase in variable operating expenses and energy costs the increase was also due to increases in rent expenses certain of which have a variable component based on hotel revenues or profitability as well as repair and maintenance expenses insurance expenses and property taxes at our international owned and leased hotels

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 14 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 depreciation expense including amortization of assets recorded under capital leases decreased 33 million primarily due to capital lease amendments which resulted in extending asset useful lives in the second half of 2011 as well as 2011 impairments which resulted in lower depreciable asset bases for 2012 these instances led to lower depreciation expense on the same assets for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 amortization expense increased 19 million primarily due to capitalized software that was placed in service during the year ended december 31 2012 



 

 

during the year ended december 31 2012 certain specific markets and properties particularly in europe continued to face operating and competitive challenges such challenges caused a decline in market value of certain corporate buildings in the current year and in expected future results for certain owned and leased properties which caused us to evaluate the carrying values of these affected properties for impairment during 2012 we recognized impairment losses of 42 million related to our owned and leased hotels 11 million of impairment losses related to certain corporate office facilities and 1 million of impairment losses related to one cost method investment during 2011 we recognized impairment losses of 17 million related to our owned and leased hotels and 3 million on timeshare properties

other expenses were 62 million and 39 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 this increase of 23 million was due to an increase of 16 million in various operating expenses incurred for the incidental support of hotel operations and an increase of 3 million for guarantee payments 

nonoperating income and expenses 



interest expense decreased 74 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in interest expense was attributable to debt payments during the fourth quarter 2011 which resulted in lower 2012 debt principal balances to which interest rates were applied 

the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt was approximately 34 percent and 37 percent for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 



the 134 million decrease in the loss from prior year was primarily due to otherthantemporary impairments on our equity investments of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to otherthantemporary impairments of 141 million for the year ended december 31 2011 resulting from declines in certain joint ventures current and expected future operating results

the obligations of the senior secured credit facility are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by us and all of our direct or indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries excluding our subsidiaries that are prohibited from providing guarantees as a result of the agreements governing our timeshare facility andor our securitized timeshare debt and our subsidiaries that secure our cmbs loan and our waldorf astoria loan additionally none of our foreign subsidiaries or our nonwholly owned domestic subsidiaries guarantee the senior secured credit facility 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to reduce capital expenditures issue additional equity securities or draw on our revolving credit facility our ability to make 

scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on the future performance of our operations which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and timeshare industries that are beyond our control 

letters of credit 

we had a total of 51 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the majority of which relate to our selfinsurance programs included in the 51 million outstanding as of december 31 2013 was 43 million  outstanding under the revolving credit facility the remaining letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2013 and all letters of credit outstanding as of december 31 2012 were issued outside the revolving credit facility the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31 2013 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  



 

 

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2013  was 435 million  these amounts are excluded from the table above because they are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next year refer to note 19   income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements further discussion of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income and cash flow 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2013  included letters of credit of 51 million guarantees of 27 million  for debt and obligations of third parties performance guarantees with possible cash outlays totaling approximately 150 million  of which we have accrued 60 million as of december 31 2013 for estimated probable exposure and construction contract commitments of approximately 121 million  for capital expenditures at our owned leased and consolidated vie hotels additionally during 2010 in conjunction with a lawsuit settlement an affiliate of our sponsor entered into service contracts with the plaintiff as part of the settlement we entered into a guarantee with the plaintiff to pay any shortfall that this affiliate does not fund related to those service contracts the remaining potential exposure under this guarantee as of december 31 2013  was approximately 48 million  see note 25   commitments and contingencies  in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these amounts 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the 

reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 2   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain as a result these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position results of operations and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances while we believe our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based on information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives 

we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of potential impairment if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment losses 

as part of the process described above we exercise judgment to 

 

 

 

we had 9058 million  of property and equipment net and  2203 million  of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31 2013  changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses which could be material 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any property and equipment with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows would result in impairment losses we did not identify any intangible assets with finite lives for which a 10 percent reduction in our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows projected operating results or other significant assumptions would result in impairment losses 

investments in affiliates 

we evaluate our investments in affiliates for impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an otherthantemporary decline in the investment’s fair value if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an otherthantemporary decline we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods which include discounted cash flows estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals if an investment’s fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be otherthantemporary we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations 

our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own andor operate hotels as such the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above if there are indicators of potential impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method and cost method investments by internally developed discounted cash flow models the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above 

we had 260 million  of investments in affiliates as of december 31 2013  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our investments in affiliates impairment testing can result in additional impairment expense which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

in conjunction with our regular assessment of impairment we did not identify any investments in affiliates with indicators of impairment for which a 10 percent change in our estimates of future cash flows or other significant assumptions would result in material impairment losses 

goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 24   business segments  in our consolidated financial statements we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment we proceed to the twostep quantitative process in the first step we evaluate the fair value of our reporting units quantitatively when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal projections and external sources the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units’ cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value then the second step must be performed in the second step we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 

we had 6220 million  of goodwill as of december 31 2013  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each reporting units by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of our reporting units 

brands 

we evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value when determining fair value we utilize discounted future cash flow models for hotels that we manage or franchise under the discounted cash flow approach we utilize various assumptions that require judgment including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated longterm growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital our estimates of longterm growth and costs are based on historical data as well as various internal estimates if a brand’s estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses 

we had 5013 million  of brand intangible assets as of december 31 2013  changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates could result in future impairment losses which could be material a change in our estimates and assumptions that would reduce the fair value of each of our brands by 10 percent would not result in an impairment of any of the brand intangible assets 

hilton hhonors 

hilton hhonors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment including an estimate of breakage points that will never be redeemed an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights occupancy rates room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay 

we had  963 million  of guest loyalty liability as of december 31 2013  changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability a 10 percent decrease to the breakage estimate used in determining future award redemption obligations would increase our guest loyalty liability by approximately 30 million 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment such as current economic conditions and industry trends as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio including assumed default rates 

we had 92 million  of allowance for loan losses as of december 31 2013  changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance a 10 percent increase to our default rates used in the allowance calculation would increase our allowance for loan losses by approximately 35 million 

income taxes 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized in performing this review we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we use a prescribed morelikelythannot recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements assumptions and estimates are used to determine the morelikelythannot designation changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax expense benefit which can materially change our consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required when we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

consolidations 

we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in our partnerships and other investments including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests if the entity is considered to be a vie we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interests in the entity we consolidate entities when we own more than 50 percent of the voting shares of a company or have a controlling general partner interest of a partnership assuming the absence of other factors determining control including the ability of minority owners to participate in or block certain decisions changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

sharebased compensation 

in connection with our ipo the equity based portion of our former executive compensation plan was modified to vested shares and unvested restricted shares of common stock and the liability portion of the plan was settled in cash the equity based award was exchanged for vested shares and unvested restricted shares of our common stock as follows 

 

 

 

we recognized sharebased compensation over the requisite service period of the individual grantee which generally equals the vesting period we currently only have service condition awards outstanding and we have elected to use the straightline method of expense attribution for such awards the process of estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions including forfeiture rates we monitor the forfeiture activity to ensure that the current estimate continues to be appropriate any changes to this estimate will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to any future grants 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may affect future income cash flows and fair value of the company depending on changes to interest rates andor foreign exchange rates in certain situations we may seek to reduce cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged we enter into derivative financial arrangements to the extent they meet the objective described above and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variablerate debt interest rates on our variablerate debt discussed below are based on onemonth and threemonth libor so we are most vulnerable to changes in this rate 

under the terms of the cmbs loan and waldorf astoria loan entered into in connection with the debt refinancing we are required to hedge interest rate risk using derivative instruments under the cmbs loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the variablerate component or 875 million which caps onemonth libor at 60 percent for the initial term of the variablerate component under the waldorf astoria loan we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in the notional amount of the loan or 525 million which caps onemonth libor at 40 percent for the first 24 months thereafter we are required to renew the interest rate cap agreement annually as of december 31 2013 the fair value of these interest rate caps were immaterial to our consolidated balance sheet 

additionally on october 25 2013 we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of 145 billion with a term of five years which swapped the floating threemonth libor on a portion of the term loans to a fixed rate of 187 percent the carrying value and fair value of these four interest rate swaps was 10 million  as of december 31 2013  

the following table sets forth the contractual maturities and the total fair values as of december 31 2013  for our financial instruments that are materially affected by interest rate risk 



 

 

refer to note 17   fair value measurements  in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct business in various foreign currencies and are exposed to earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates this exposure is primarily related to our international assets and liabilities whose value could change materially in reference to our usd reporting currency the most significant effect of changes to foreign currency values include certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested and to transactions for management and franchise fee revenues earned in foreign currencies 

our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between usd and the british pound sterling gbp and euro eur historically we used foreign exchange currency option agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain of our foreign investments as of december 31 2013 we did not hold any derivative hedging instruments related to our foreign currency exposure
